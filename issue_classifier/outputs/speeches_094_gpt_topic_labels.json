    "speech": "Mr. President. this week the Turkish Foreign Minister. the Honorable I. S. Caglayangil. is scheduled to visit Washington. All Americans who value the traditionally good relations between our two countries will warmly welcome the Foreign Ministers visit. and hope that the talks he has with President Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger will prove fruitful. However. in their talks with the Foreign Minister. I am hopeful that the President and Secretary Kissinger will give the highest priority to the Cyprus problem. Because. whether we like it or not. bringing peace and justice to the people of Cyprus is crucial to restoring our good relations with Turkey. In the absence of any real progress in resolving the Cyprus problem. Turkey is further entrenching its military occupation of northern Cyprus. The heavy presence of Turkish troops and arnament continues. And thousands of settlers from mainland Turkey have arrived on the island. and apparently are being given the right to participate in the forthcoming elections in the occupied areas. In the meantime. not a single CypriotGreek refugee has returned to his home. In fact. over recent months the Turkish authorities have created even more refugees. by expelling hundreds of CypriotGreeks from their homes in the occupied areas. And this gross violation of the Vienna agreements. concluded under United Nations auspices just last August. continues daily. Mr. President. the administration is apparently recognizing this sad record of Turkish occupation in northern Cyprus. And I fully share the concern of Secretary Kissinger. expressed to me in a recent letter. that such \"developments on the island during the last several months might inhibit progress in the Cyprus negotiations.\" For this reason I am making an appeal to the President and the Secretary of State to give the highest priority to the Cyprus problem in the days ahead. Mr. President. I would like to share with the Senate a recent exchange of co rrespondance which I have had. as chairman of the Subcommittee on Refugees. and which other members of the subcommittee have had. with the Department of State over the Cyprus problem. I ask unanimous consent that the Departments letter commenting on the subcommittees recent report on Cyprus. and the Departments reply to an earlier subcommittee letter. be printed in the RECORD.",

With the energy problems our Nation faces. nuclear power is not a source of energy we can turn our backs on. however. we must protect ourselves from nuclear terrorism. The necessity for the type of legislation presented in S. 2838 is obvious. With this in mind. I ask unanimous consent that the article. \"Bomb Threats Cited at Nuclear Reactors.\" from the Washington Post. be printed in the RECORD.

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of the most often voiced criticisms of the Genocide Convention is that its ratification by the United States would adversely affect FederalState relations by sapping the authority of States in criminal matters. However. this is clearly not the case. I want to demonstrate today why the Genocide Convention does not affect relations between the Federal Government and the States. and show you that the States have nothing to fear from ratification. Let me point out first that article 1. section 8. clause 10 of the Constitution provides thatThe Congress shall have the Power... To Define and Punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas. and Offenses against the Law of Nations ... Congress does have the constitutional right to enact legislation which makes genocide a crime and provides for appropriate punishment. If Congress so desired. it could enact such legislation even without a treaty. Furthermore. article V of the Genocide Convention says that signators will undertake to enact \"in accordance with their respective constitutions\" legislation which is necessary to institute the provisions of the convention. Ratification of the convention will not entail a basic change in FederalState relations as set forth in the Constitution. The Federal Government will not be encroaching on the rights of States to handle criminal matters within their judisdictions. Article VI of the Convention. which concerns the trial of alleged genocidists. says only thatPersons charged with genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article III shall be tried by a competent tribunal of the State in the territory of which the act was committed. The only crime which the Convention refers to is genocide. and even here the makeup of the \"competent tribunal\" is left to the discretion of the nation involved. As the American Bar Association has said: Ratification of the Convention will add no powers to those the Federal Government already possesses. Ratification will. however. make us a stronger and a better nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the tightening of the dictatorship of President Park Chung Hee in the Republic of Korea and increasingly frequent and credible reports of largescale denial of human rights there are very disturbing to me. This is doubly so because South Korea is an old and important ally of the United States. It is often difficult to decide what our relationship should be with countries which deny fundamental human or political rights. In extreme circumstances close relations with .the most deplorable regimes are justifiable. For example. who would criticize our alliance with the Soviet Union against Hitlers Germany in World War II? But. in my view. the United States relationship with South Korea is becoming increasingly untenable. Korea undoubtedly has a considerable importance for the United States. and it has an even greater importance to Japan. Another complicating factor is that an everirredentist North Korea is still something of a threat to the south. But there appears to be no basis in fact for Parks claim that repression is necessary because of the threat from the North. Mr. President. the United States cannot separate its domestic reality from its foreign policies. We cannot be the guardian of dictatorial. corrupt and cruel regimes overseas and remain a free and compassionate country within. There is an inevitable Interaction between these two aspects of our national life. At the very least. it is high time that the administration began making a major effort to persuade Mr. Park to liberalize his regime if he wishes to retain his historical relationship with the United States. The time may be approaching when we should reassess just what our interests are in Korea and what our future military and political role should be with such an increasingly repressive government.

But I might say that the reason for the legislation disappeared when the national riots disappeared. and I cannot see that there is this crying need for this legislation at the present time. I do not question that as many as 100 or more police officers meet their deaths each yearin line of duty. But that does not convert local law enforcement with a national obligationand responsibility. Furthermore. I would like to point out that this is not legislation which provides benefits for law enforcement officers who are killed as a result of the commission of some criminal act. Instead. full benefits are provided for all law enforcement officers who meet their death \"in the performance of duty.\" That can mean a great variety of thingsincluding death from an accident while cruising in a squad caror while traveling to or from a policemans home and his office in the police station. So I think this is not appropriate legislation for the Federal Government. I think it is not timely. I think if it had a time. its time has gone. and we should not act on this legislation today. For a further detailed and persuasive statement in opposition to this measure I direct my colleagues attention to the dissenting views set forth on pages 19 to 21 of the committee report.",

In that year. 1968. there were 64 killed. in 1969. 86 were killed. in 1970. 100 were killed. in 1971. 129 were killed. in 1972. 114 were killed. in 1973. 131 were killed. in 1974. 130 were killed. and in 1975 there were 124 killed.

I rise in strong support for the enactment of this legislation which would provide a $50.000 death benefit to the surviving dependents of public safety officers who are slain in the line of duty. Though there can be no adequate compensation to the families of those courageous individuals who having lost a loved one I believe our society can fulfill its moral duty to ease the financial burden of those who have depended upon them. Many State and local governments provide little or no benefits to such dependents when a public safety officer is killed in the line of duty. This bill is designed to meet the immediate financial need of the survivors and is not intended as a substitute measure in instances where State and local governments already have benefit programs in effect. This legislation will have a favorable impact upon the improved morale of public safety officers personnel. It will have the effect of improving recruitment since individuals who in the law enforcement profession will have the knowledge that should they suddenly die in the line of duty their dependents will be protected from financial hardship. It is hoped that local and State governments will better be able to obtain competent motivated police officers by the passage of this legislation.",

This legislation will provide a $50.000 Federal payment to the surviving dependents of law enforcement officers who die as a result of injury sustained in the line of duty. There can be little doubt about the need for this legislation. Law enforcement is a very hazardous profession. It is a sad fact that more than 1.000 law enforcement officers have been killed in the past decade. According to the uniform crime reports. in 1975 alone 124 officers were killed as the result of felonious criminal action. This legislation will give assistance to the officers survivors so that they can adjust economically to the loss of the familys breadwinner. It will help tide them over financially through a very difficult period. Frankly. I think $50.000 is small compensation for the loss they have suffered. The very least we can do for those who put their lives on the line to protect our society is to offer some financial security for their families in the event of their death.",

It was felt that the plan and its associated procedures would be incompatible with the official and public correspondence needs of the United States. The U.S. will observe the plan to the extent practicable. but will not be bound by that provision of the Revision. The Partial Revision will enter into force on January 1. 1976. for governments which. by that date. have notified the Secretary General of the International Telecommunications Union of their approval thereof.

Instead of that taking place. the action resulted in no action.

At page 81 of its report. the committee recognizes that environmental programs are already established in other agencies. such as NOAA. and that ERDA must take special steps to avoid wasteful duplications of effort.

The committeeat pages 8182 of its report--has directed ERDA to coordinate its activities with other Federal agencies. with specific attention to the program responsibilities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Senator MusKIE and I wrote to the Interior Committee regarding our interest in implementation of section 6(b) (3)K of the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act. This section is a specific directive to ERDA to Investigate the technical and economic feasibility of harnessing the tidal power of the oceans for the generation of electric power. The Canadian Government recently Indicated renewed interest in this concept by committing itself to a reevaluation of the tidal power potential of the Bay of Fundy on the MaineCanadian border. Passamaquoddy Bay in the same area has long been of interest to both Canada and the United States as a site for tidal power development. This past spring. the Public Works Committee approved a resolution authorizing the Army Corps of Engineers to do a new feasibility study of the Passamaquoddy projectto update work done in the early 1960s. In light of the renewed Canadian interest. the congressional directive to ERDA. and the public works resolution. a reevaluation of the Passamaquoddy project. coordinated with the Canadian Governments efforts. is particularly timely. .. From repeated inquiries to ERDA and a review of the National Plan for Energy Research recently published by that agency. it appears that ERDA does not intend to undertake any indepth studies in tidal power development.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to commend Senators PASTORE and CHURCH and all of their colleagues on the committees on which they serve. for what appears to be a very good bill. Of particular interest to me is the section dealing with solar energy development. I believe I am correct in stating that Senator CHURCHS committee seeks an authorization for solar energy development of $106.200.000 for fiscal year 1976 costs and $26.800.000 for transition period costs. As the section of the committee report relating to solar development recognizes. solarbased energy systems provide one of the most attractive and promising of the Nations alternative energy prospects. This statement is indeed true. I have witnessed firsthand the operation of many solarbased energy systems in my own State of Colorado. I have noted the widespread enthusiasm given solar energy by homeowners and businessmen who are seeking relief from our dependency on environmentally damaging and increasingly expensive fossil fuels. Scores of consumer and environmental organizations are involving themselves in the promotion of solar energy as can be seen by the ambitious Bicentennial solar energy exhibit involving ERDA and consumer groups working to develop the only energyrelated Bicentennial exhibit for the Nations Capital. . The public is far ahead of the politicians in their recognition of the potential values of solar energy utilization. The people of this country realize the advantage solar energy offers in helping address our energy problems. yet they are finding it difficult to obtain information on how to evaluate and install solar systems as opposed to conventional energy equipment. Hundreds of small businessmen. who have been and continue to be the pioneers in their field seek vital information to augment their own efforts to develop systems which will meet our energy needs. The information exists in many instances and much of it can be found within those Federal structures we have directed to collect and disseminate information relating to solar technologies. Am I not correct in stating that Public Law 93473. the Solar Energy Research. Development. and Demonstration Act of 1974. directs the Administrator of ERDA to establish and operate a Solar Energy Information Data Bank for the purpose of collecting. reviewing. processing. and disseminating information and data in all of the solar energy technologies?",

Mr. Hildebrand has evidently become an apologist for the present Cambodian government. since our office. based on direct information from within Cambodia. as well as a very careful investigation on the many stories concerning Cambodia as circulated abroad in the past year. has determined that the evidence substantially establishes the present Cambodian government as one of the most oppressive. despotic regimes in modern history and that proportionately. the deaths traceable to the present action of the Cambodian government exceed those of the concentration camps of Hitlers Germany. and of the Soviet regime between 1919 and 1954. that the present Cambodian government is systematically destroying the family unit. has torn the economy assunder and has survived by terror and oppression.

This independent agency. which supports fundamental research in the natural and social sciences and. since 1968. the application of scientific knowledge and techniques to national problems. has extended our understanding of natural forces and our ability to deal with them. and it has enriched our culture. The Foundation has also exerted a strong and beneficial influence on science education. from the elementary grades through the postdoctoral level. Even before the Soviets launched their first sputnik in October 1957. and thereby caused national. anxiety about the condition of our science instruction. the Foundation was initiating significant reforms in the content of school curriculums and improving the capabilities of science teachers through summer institutes. The Foundation has always emphasized qualityin research and educationand it has fostered the growth of quality by encouraging merit wherever it could be found. To insure a healthy academic base for American science. the Foundation has invested heavily in the improvement of colleges and universities. seeking to increase the number of centers of scientific excellence in both graduate and undergradute education throughout the Nation. It is improving educational opportunities for ethnic minorities. and it Is trying to remove some of the obstacles to careers in science for women. Increasingly. the foundation is encouraging experimental projects that give promise of major change and improvement in science education. The National Science Foundation has been fortunate in having had stability in its leadership and having had four distinguished science administrators to direct the agencys course. The late Dr. Alan T. Waterman headed the Foundation from its establishment until 1963. Dr. Leland J. Haworth led the NSF from 1963 until 1969. From then until 1972. Dr. William D. McElroy served as Director. Dr. H. Guyford Stever. the fourth and present Director of the National Science Foundation since 1972. and his able. hardworking staff. deserve our thanks for their advancement of science and science education and they merit our encouragement as they build on the notable achievements of the past quarter century.",

Fort Ticonderoga was strategically located on the inland waterway route between the British colonies and Canada. The fort. built by the French but taken by the British. commanded the outlet of Lake George into Lake Champlain.

American morale was stimulated by the victory. Lexington and Concord are highlights of Americas story. but those actions were in response to British aggression. At Fort Ticonderoga. American troops. for the first time. took the offensive against British regulars in a British stronghold. This was rebellion.

I have discovered that another administration figure. who now wants to give away the Canal Zone. vigorously opposed any such action when Lyndon Johnson proposed giving away our great ditch through the Isthmus of Panama. On April 13. with the previous consent of the Panama Canal Subcommittee. I made public the exchange between myself and Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker over current treaty negotiations. In that exchange. I recalled President Fords vehement denunciation of the Johnson draft treaty with Panama in Now I have learned that the Presidents campaign chairman. the Honorable Rogers Morton. who currently says the Canal Zone is Panamanian territory. at that time supported a tough sovereignty resolution in Congress. Then a Maryland Congressman. Rogers Morton cosponsored House Concurrent Resolution 389. introduced June 28. 1967. The resolved clause of that resolution read: That it is the sense of the Congress that the Government of the United States maintain and protect its sovereign rights and jurisdiction over said canal and that the United States Government In no way forfeit. cede. negotiate. or transfer any of these sovereign rights or Jurisdiction to any other sovereign nation or international organization. Such opposition forced Johnson to pigeonhole the treaty.

Tack constitute a clear and present danger to the hemispheric security and the successful operation of the canal by the United States under its treaty obligations. ...

The Senate amendments struck out of the House passed bill the funding authorizations for the fiscal year 1977. The Senate did not disagree with the House passed bill with respect to the level of funding for fiscal year 1976 or 1977. The Senate action occurred on December 1. 1975. and at that time the Senate did object to any funding for the fiscal year 1977. Previous authorizations under the Noise Control Act of 1972 expired on June 30. 1975. Activities under the act were continued under the continuing resolutionPublic Law 9441until the enactment of the Environmental Protection Agencys regular appropriations billPublic Law 94116. This bill is necessary to provide authorizations for the appropriated funds. In view of the fact that we are approaching the end of fiscal year 1976. it is my understanding that the Senate is willing to reconsider its position on authorizing funds for fiscal year 1977. I am making this unanimousconsent request to give the Senate an opportunity to reconsider its previous amendments. If this is done. the bill can be immediately cleared for signature by the President. If not. the Senate is free to request a conference with the House.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. we bring before the Committee of the Whole House today one of the most important bills that has been brought before this body this year. If we look back on the accomplishments of vocational education up to 1962. prior to the passage of the 1963 act. we were spending $254 million a year. That is at the local. State. and Federal level. The figures were $48 million at the Federal level. $89 million at the State level. and $117 million at the local level. At that time the benefits were going to 4 million students. but in twothirds of our high schools and in many colleges there were no programs at all. Mr. Chairman. I do want to state that we learned a lesson that paid off tremendously as a result of World War II. Because of the veterans program during and immediately following World War II. we provided for an expenditure of $297 million to authorize special vocational educational programs which trained 7.5 million people during World War II and immediately thereafter at a 5year cost of $297 million. I think we all recall those days. certainly many of the older Members of this Chamber do. That evidence is all in the record when we were studying the 1963 act. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 12835 extends for several more years certain expiring Federal education programs and amends these programs to better focus the funds. The bill has been reported unanimously by the Committee on Education and Labor. Mr. Chairman. I certainly want to pay tribute to the entire Subcommittee on Elementary and Secondary Education and to the gentleman from Indiana and his subcommittee and to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Qui). all of whom have worked handinglove with both subcommittees in bringing the National Institute of Education bill to the floor and the vocational education bill to the floor. The first title amends the Vocational Education Act. The gentleman from Indiana will handle the National Institute of Education. That is the second title. The third title contains various technical amendments and miscellaneous amendments to Federal education laws.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I favor passage of the bill before us and believe it would go far toward addressing those needs which are not being adequately met by current legislation. One such need is for vocational teachers and to remedy this situation I introduced an amendment which was approved by the committee and is now part of H.R. 12835. I would like to explain what this amendment is intended to accomplish. Vocational enrollments at all levels have expanded rapidly during the past decade. While the number of vocational teachers has also gone up. it has not increased sufficiently to keep pace with enrollments. State directors of vocational education have described the vocational teachers shortage as critical. Fortythree States have reported some degree of shortages. It has been estimated by the National Education Association that vocational teacher demand exceeds the supply by 38.7 percent. Despite these shortages. little has been done to entice individuals to enter into the vocational teaching profession. My amendment provides this incentive by authorizing two new types of teacher fellowships to be added to the present fellowships for graduate students in vocational education. The first new fellowship is for teachers who have already been credentialed by the States in other fields and who have job skills in demand in vocational education. There is a general surplus of trained teachers in other fields. Those who have not been able to secure teaching jobs have for the most part become retrained and employed in other occupational areas. The new fellowships would enable certified teachers with vocational skills to obtain the additional course work required for vocational teaching. The second new fellowship is for persons in industry who have job skills in demand in vocational education but who do not necessarily have a bachelors or teaching degree. Such awards would help alleviate the teacher demand and would also bring in people with needed skills. new ideas and experience within an industrial setting. My amendment would also result in better coordination between the courses in which teachers are being trained and the courses for which they are needed. The Commissioner of Education is required to identify areas of shortage and make awards to those who can best fill them. I ask for your support to H.R. 12835 including this amendment which is so crucial to the future of vocational education.",

I was the author of a maintenanceofeffort amendment in the committee. and I think it is important to note that in authorizing the Commissioner to waive maintenanceofeffort performance under very specific circumstances. it is important to recognize that the committee intends this authorty to be exercised only in instances where the local education agency can demonstrate that every possible effort on the part of school administrators has been made to obtain local financial support. A lot would hinge. of course. on how very exceptional the circumstances are and how that is interpreted. In Washington State and in other States. under State law each school district must go to the voters. in some instances. for special levies to meet operating expenses over and above that guaranteed by the State. Further. State laws prohibit a school district from trying more than twice in any one year to get voter approval of a school maintenance and operation levy. I would ask the chairman if he would agree with me that double levy failures in areas in which two consecutive levy failures prohibit the issue from being voted on again in that year. would be considered by us to be such exceptional circumstances.",

I am sure the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Qum) would agree with me that one of the things we found in our hearings was that State advisory councils were not being utilized and were not having the input in the decisionmaking process that they ought to be having. By this legislation we have substantially increased the authority. the input. the coordination with advisory councils. Mr. Chairman. I really want to take this time to point out to those who come along afterwards and appropriate for this bill how important that section on authorization for appropriations for State advisory councils is. If we cannot get the appropriations to have proper funding for counsel and for help for State advisory councils. they will be nothing more than paper organizations. Their importance under this legislation is exceedingly great. and we should recognize that we must appropriate the money to give them the wherewithal to carry out those functions.",

As we all know. the President is at Helsinki at the present time. He is endeavoring to arrange talks with the appropriate Turkish officials there. In the meantime. we have been given orders as to how the bases in Turkey will be controlled by the Turks. although our troops are allowed to remain. We are aware of the fact that according to reports about 25 percent of our intelligence operations visavis the Soviet Union are located in Turkey and we have spent something on the order of $1.5 billion. The other body some few days ago turned down a compromise proposal which had been offered by the President. The vote was quite close and the issue is now. once again. before the Congress. Personally. I wish it was possible in some way for the House to take up this measure and reconsider its previous actions. but with time running short and with the Congress going out on Friday. we now have before us the StateJustice appropriations bill to which a possibility of an amendment affecting aid to Turkey could be considered. I speak compassionately about Greece because I think what has been done is not in the best interests of Greece. not in the best interests of its outstanding Premier. Mr. Karamanlis. not in the best interests of Cyprus. not in the best interests of the refugees in Cyprus. and because if something is not done to break the impasse which has resulted because of a situation originally inaugurated by the socalled colonels clique of the Greek Government. it means that there will be no progress made. and that these Greek refugees. the Cypriot refugees on Cyprus. will continue to be in a sorry state. and that improvement in TurkishCypriot relations will not occur. and that. in my opinion. the situation in Greece will become more difficult for Prime Minister Karamanlis and will be further away than ever from a possible settlement which could.

The only other NATO country is Norway. with a common frontier with the Soviet Union. and that is very little as far as mileage is concerned. We know also that the Greeks have given us a polite request to tone down some of our activities in Turkey. We know that if Turkey does not get arms from this country. for which she has already paid. she will turn to Western Europe. Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union and to pay for those arms in all likelihood she will most likely turn to the Arab States in the Middle East. Up to this time the Turks have adopted a handsoff. very correct attitude. as far as the Middle East situation is concerned. and. hopefully. she will continue to adopt that attitude. But if she has to turn to the Arabs for money to buy arms which she cannot get from us. for which she has already paid. that means that as a Mohammedan country. it might take a more active interest in that most difficult powder pot in that part of the world.

Many Members of this body know the name of Dean Alfange and he has decided to put his country. the United States. above everything in his pleading to his fellow Greeks to do the same.

In addition. todays workers are building medicare protection for themselves and their spouses. Many people. though. are unaware of the value and worth of their social security coverage. Participants quite often fail to realize that social security has an automatic costofliving adjustment mechanism to protect beneficiaries from inflation. Another important consideration is that social security benefits are exempt from Federal and State income tax. One way to illustrate the value of social security protection is to examine a worker who reaches age 65 upon retiring in January 1976. has a wife who becomes 62 in the same month. and has average monthly earnings of $585.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on June 15 the Committee on the Judiciary voted to report to the Senate S. 2387. the Petroleum Industry Competition Act. which would require vertical divestiture of the 18 largest oil companies operating in the United States and. with limited exceptions. true common carrier status for crude oil and petroleum product pipelines. The Judiciary Committee vote came in the face of an intensive lobbying campaign by the oil industry through the American Petroleurm Institute and by the individual companies. With the bill now on the Senate calendar the industry is using its vast resources throughout the country in an effott to defeat the legislation on the Senate floor. During my 14 years in the Senate I have never seen such an extensive and costly lobbying campaign as that which the oil industry has mounted in an effort to defeat the vertical divestiture legislation. Since the oil industry has managed to generate significant mail and editorial comment against divestiture through the skillful exploitation of its virtually unlimited funds. I hope my colleagues will understand the source of the antidivestiture mail and literature they are receiving. This is not a spontaneous response by concerned citizens. rather it is a tremendously expensive. carefully orchestrated program assembled by the wealthiest and biggest industry in the world. Very candidly. it is a lobbying effort that the proponents of divestiture cannot match in size or dollars. but which I fully believe we can beat through substantive responses to the misinformation being generated by the oil industry. So that my colleagues might have a better sense of the magnitude of the industrys campaign against the vertical divestiture legislation. I request unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a thoroughly researched and wellwritten article on this issue that appeared in the Washington Star on July 4. The article was written by Roberta Hornig. one of the more discerning energy specialists among the media here in Washington.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the recent retirement of Bob MacGregor after 44 years with the Hartford Times leaves a major void in Connecticut journalism. He was always the first reporter on the scene of a late breaking story. And he persisted in attempts to disclose official wrongdoing in State government. Bob could take pride in the fact that his efforts resulted in positive steps by the Connecticut State Legislature to end practices that he brought to public attention. When Bob was assigned to cover the State capitol in Hartford 28 years ago on a temporary basis. probably no one other than Bob himself expected that he would become a permanent fixture on the legislative and political scene for years to come. His column on political developments in Connecticut provided those of us in politics with a ready source of information which we knew we could rely on for accuracy and insight. I remember most vividly Bobs outstanding reporting of Connecticuts flood in 1955. Bob went to great lengths to bring to his readers onthescene coverage not only in words but in the pictures that resulted from his unique camera work. This exemplified his unending desire for the hot story. and his readers have always appreciated Bobs enthusiasm for timely. firstrate reporting. Bobs friends in the press corps knew quality when they saw it. so it was no surprise when Bob climbed to the top of his profession. His colleague respected both his reporting skills and his downtoearth personality for which they developed a deep affection. They selected him to serve as president of the Laurel Club. an organization of State capitol news reporters in Connecticut. There are few greater signs of admiration and respect than when one is so honored by his colleagues. I wish Bob MacGregor all the best on his retirement from the Hartford Times. He has established a standard for political reporters that will be hard to equal. His career of reporting excellence has kept Hartford area readers well informed for decades. and his steady hand at the Hartford Times will be sorely missed.",

It is appropriate to recall the names of Maalot. Kiryat Shmona. Munich. Lod Airport. and other scenes of Arab terrorist murders against Israel and her citizens which will live forever in the minds of decent people.

The State of Michigan submitted a strong proposal outlining the capabilities and facilities which Michigan offers as a site for SERI. Although images of sunshine and Southern States are conjured up when considering solar energy. the primary criteria required for the SERI project are the availability of industrial technology and scientific expertise to implement the projects goal of transferring the present solar energy technological research into economically competitive systems. Michigan is ideally suited to fulfill the criteria set forth by ERDA and the National Academy of Sciences: The State has extensive industrial capabity and ingenuity. its manufacturing capability is second to none. and research and development activity by private industry in the State is among the highest in the country. The State Is centrally located near existing businesses which are currently involved in production and distribution of residential and commercial cooling and heating systems from which future solar energy systems will evolve. Michigan has chemical. steel and electronic industries which will be in a position to supply equipment systems for solar energy production. The universities in the State offer a wealth of scientific and technical resources. Six major universities are located in the immediate vicinity of Michigans proposed alternative sites. Michigan is centrally located within the country and has an excellent network of highway. air. rail and water transportation that will facilitate transportation and communications for the project. And finally. the State has established the Michigan Energy and Resource Research Association to coordinate private and public energy research in Michigan. This association already has been involved in the initiation of several significant energy projects in the State and brings considerable expertise to the development of SERI. Mr. President. the State of Michigan has extensive energy needs. and development of a commercially feasible solar energy system will affect directly and beneficially its continued industrial future. It is logical that this program be situated in the largest energy consuming sector of the country. The State has spent many months drawing up its proposal for submission to the Energy Research and Development Administration.

    "speech": "Mr. President. once again I rise to address my colleagues concerning the necessity for congressional ratification of the Genocide Treaty. Opposition to the treaty has long asserted that the entire subject of human rights is not an appropriate one for international agreement. Genocide must be the concern of the community of nations since the horror of its consequences knows no geographic boundaries. We should not allow the frightening memories of the World War II holocaust to fade from our minds. Under the Constitution. the President has the power with advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties. The Genocide Treaty falls within the realm of this constitutional authority. According to former Supreme Court Justice Thomas C. Clark: Treaties which deal with the rights of individuals... as a matter of international concern may be a proper exercise of the treatymaking power of the United States. The United States not only has the authority to enter into such agreements but there is no question that adequate precedent exists. A quarter of a century has passed since- this country used its treaty powers to become a party to the United Nations Charter. one of whose basic purposes is the promotion of human rights for all. America has previously acted in conjunction with other nations to condemn those who violate agreements regarding seal hunting. opium trade. and slave trade. Mr. President. in failing to ratify the Genocide Convention. the United States can no longer plead that it is constitutionally Impotent to do so. The fact that genocide is an issue appropriate for concern and action seems obvious. It is our moral obligation and within our legal power to ratify this document. We must do so.",

Apparently it is the administrations intention to leave American citizens for the last possible moment. perhaps at a time when they must be brought out under fire. L. Dean Brown. U.S. Task Force Director. was quoted at a State Department news conference yesterday as saying. \"If Saigon is under attack and the airfield is under attack. that is that.

I want to say that all members of the conference. indeed. all members of the Committee on Foreign Relations have tried very hard to design a bill that meets the needs of the current crisis In Saigon. Certain members of the committee have opposed this bill. I want to say to them. to Senator CLARK of Iowa. to Senator BIDEN of Delaware. that I fully appreciate the reason for their misgiving. Furthermore. I want to say that I share with them the concern they have expressed about the sluggish pace of the withdrawal from Saigon of American citizens and their dependents. There is no reason why the remaining Americans should not be out of Saigon by now. except for those absolutely critical to the mission. and this number is 500 or less. The reason why it Is necessary to remove all unessential Americans is to make certain that. if worse comes to worse. and it is necessary to use U.S. Armed Forces to rescue the remaining Americans. this can then be done very quickly. with the least possible exposure of our forces and the least possible danger of them being mired down in protracted hostilities. Mr. President. if we reach that point. the question we face is whether we are going to leave it to the President to decide how many troops to employ. how many foreign nationals to bring out with the Americans. or whether we are going to tie it down with the stringent restrictions contained in this bill. When the President sent in U.S. forces to remove Americans and Cambodians from Phnom Penh. he did not ask for a clarification of the law. he did not ask for congressional authority. He exercised what he believed to be his constitutional prerogative as commander in chief. But he did ask for a clarification of the law when it came to Vietnam. Now we are giving him that clarification. and we are giving it to him in such terms that Congress imposes the limitations that will apply if it becomes necessary to use troops.",

I am proposing amendment No. 1782 to S. 2872 to provide FEA with $3.000.000 to encourage accelerated utilization and widespread commercialization of existing solar technologies. Through accelerated solar energy use. this Nation could save 1 million barrels of oil per day by 1985 and as much as 3 million barrels by 1990. This program would not preempt but complement the work being done by the Energy Research and Development Administration. The purpose of this program is to take an extensive assortment of *solar technologies off the shelf and put them to practical use. Concern for the environment. our miserable track record on achieving pnergy selfsufficiency. and recent estimtes which show that world oil reserves are depleting more rapidly than once predicted have forced us to take a closer look at all energy sources. Since the dawn of the energy crisis solar energy has come into the limelight as a promising alternative. As a result. substantial funds have been committed to the research and development of this resource. The House recently authorized $345 million for fiscal year 1977 for ERDA solar research. development. and demonstration. and the Senate will act shortly on a similar measure. This research commitment is vitally important to the development of solar energy. but equally important is an aggressive program of commercialization. The amendment I am sponsoring provides FEA with funding and staff necessary to establish this prograin. The program is not new. It has been talked about for several years. but somehow has always been left out of administration priorities. Accelerated use of solar energy is achievable. but it needs the support provided by this amendment. At present there are only two professionals in FEAs solar division. which is barely enough manpower to answer the mail and prepare congressional testimony. My amendment would allow for the addition of 10 staff positions and would inject funds into projects vital to an accelerated solar effort. These projects were described as necessary to the development of FEAs National Plan for the Accelerated Commercialization of Solar Energy. An outline for this plan appeared in FEA testimony last May before Senator NELSONS Small Business Committee hearings on solar energy. I ask unanimous consent that this outline be printed in the REcORD at this point.",

    "speech": "Apart from generally providing details of the program and a synopsis of the varied applications of solar technology. it delineates the institutional responsibilities of FEA in the national solar program. It states: Government responsibility for the research. development and demonstration of these solar technologies is vested in the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). The Federal Energy Administration (PEA) has primary responsibility for developing and implementing programs and policies to further widespread commercialization and accelerated use of proven solar technologies. Also. PEA is responsible for integrating solar energy policies into the national energy strategy. Beyond the Federal level of government. states can provide significant support in accelerating the use of solar energy. PEA is developing programs to assist States with policies and programs designed to accelerate commercial application of solar energy. This is how FEA perceives its role in the development of solar energy. Still. the Energy Research and Development Administration supports the role of FEA in promoting the commercial utilization of energy alternatives. The ERDA Basic Energy Document. ERDA 761. states: ERDA 761. Among all the Federal agency interactions affecting energy RD&D. perhaps the most important is that between ERDA and the Federal Energy Administration. It is here that a strong tie is established at the working level between national energy policy and national energy RD&D policy. ERDAs focus is the economic and operational aspects of the energy systems. The activities of the two agencies do. of course. overlap and complement each other. In addressing technological problems. ERDA must recognize the possible institutional and social barriers to implementation of both existing and new technologies and hence. must interact strongly with PEA as the companion agency that can mount attacks on such problems. In modifying the present energy system. PEA should recognize the existence of technological issues and. hence. must interact strongly with ERDA. the agency that can mount attacks on such problems.

It needs that push to get it into commercial operation. The only question any of us have with regard to the amendment of the Senator from Colorado would be whether any overlap exists between the various purposes of PEA and ERDA. ERDA already has some $10 nillion in the commercialization area. FEA. with this boost. will have some $3 million in this area. in addition to work that has already been going on. Since we all desire the moving ahead of solar energy just as rapidly as possible. I see nothing wrong with this overlap. I think to disrupt programs that either one of these agencies have in existence now and tear them up just so we can have a uniformity in one agency would not be wise for solar energy at the present time. particlarly with it at its present critical stage of moving into very largescale commerdial development in the very near future.

Nor are they required to analyze each of these anticipated means. to tell us what the effect on national security. the environment. balance of trade risks. et cetera. of each of these methods will be. For example. if it is the prediction of the FEA that in 1980 we will be consuming. let us say. 20 million barrels of oil a day. then they ought to be able to anticipate how much of that will be domestic. and if they are setting. let us say. a domestic production goal of 11 million barrels a day by 1980. they ought to be able to tell us where that will come fromfor instance. how many barrels they are predicting from Alaska. In this way. Congress and all Federal agencies will have a way by which to measure the progress. not only of energy consumption but of energy production in this Nation. If we are really counting on. say. the equivalent of 4 million barrels a day from coal by a certain date. and if implicit in that assumption and that calculation is the strip mining of coal. then at the time we consider a strip mining bill on coal. we will have something by which to measure the effect of passage vel non of such a bill. or of drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. or of a bill to conserve energy.

I think the questions raised by the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. across the aisle. are sensible. Certainly his questions regarding the tenure of PEA and the time period in which these reports would be made are well taken. I think it would also be well at the same time to point out that if FEA goes out of existence at its projected 15month period allocated by this bill we would assume that its role would be taken over subsequently by some other organization. Whether it is a department of energy and natural resources. or whatever entity. it would replace FEA. At that time certainly this laudable objective of trying to look ahead and plan a little bit in the future would go right directly with the other functions of FEA over into this newer organization. If we had some people in this Nation in the past 15 or 20 years mandated to do exactly what the Senator from Louisiana is talking about in the Chamber. perhaps we would not be in some of the mess that we are in today with regard to energy. I do not take quite the same strong view of the inadequacy of FEA in this area that some other Members of this body do. I think we perhaps have made at least a start. a first glimmering of hope with our start toward energy policy with the shortterm things that we have done and some of the longterm efforts that we are putting into the budget that we are providing for ERDA.

With the outbreak of World War II he began 5 years of military service. He was with the 3d Marine Division. 3d Marine Regiment. and saw fighting in the South Pacific. He was decorated with two bronze stars and received a Presidential citation. He is still a colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve. In 1946 John returned to the State Department and was immediately assigned as a treaty technician at the San Francisco Peace Conference. Then began years of service overseas in Egypt. Ghana. Nigeria and South Africa. He became one of the real experts on the continent of Africa and at the time of his retirement was one of the top officers on the African desk at the Department. He has received special awards for his work in this important assignment. I am sure that John looks back with great satisfaction on the years of accomplishment and at the same time looks forward to years of good health and deserved rest and freedom in his retirement. I am sure we all join in telling John. \"A job well done. Your Nation thanks you.\"",

Having been president of a golf club at one time and having served on a city council where recreation was a very important matter. I feel I know something about the subject. Consequently. I have looked into the matter of golf courses in the Air Force alone. and I find to begin with that golf courses are operated in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 1330.2. It is Air Force policy that golf facilities offset all nonappropriated fund expenses related to course operation and produce a reasonable net income. This income supplements appropriated funding support to other morale. welfare. and recreation activities and programs such as libraries. athletics. and recreational centers. which are not selfsufficient. In many cases. golf facility earnings have resulted in the survival of these programs and services which are vital to the morale and physical wellbeing of Air Force personnel. At this point in my discussion. I ask unanimous consent that a compilation of Air Force golf course statistics for 1974 be printed in the RECORD.",

It is time to look at what the U.S.S.R. is doingnot what they are saying. Looking at the past decade gives us a good grasp of what the Soviet Union is doing. There was a significant increase in the capabilities of warships. a similar increase in operations at sea. and intensified use of naval forces to support political goals. Basic comparative sizes of the two navies in January 1976. was as follows: Surface warships (Escorts and larger) Small combatants ------------Submarines (including nuclear submarines) Amphibious ships (over 200 ft) ------------------------Soviet Union It is estimated we will be well into the 1980s before we see any slackening in the current rate of Soviet warship construction. Ditente becomes another \"buzz word\" when we look at actions and not listen to words. I do not lightly label detente a \"buzz word.\" It is done with serious concern today over Soviet and Sovietsponsored Cuban aggression in Angola. It is done in the context of neglect of our Navy for almost a decade. Since 1968. the Navy has suffered consistent and planned erosion in battle strength of the fleet. During these years. when we consider carriers. surface combatants. attack submarines. amphibious ships. auxiliaries. sninecraft. patrol vessels and replenishment ships. the U.S. Navy has been reduced across the board by an average of 50 percent. a far cry from 1945 when the Navy outnumbered the coastally oriented Navy of the Soviet Union by 5 to 1.

Until recently Ken was president of the worlds largest cattle feeding operation. Monfort of Colorado. which also slaughters and packs its own beef. He has now retired himself to the position of cochairman of the board. In the Post article Ken offers his ideas about what the future holds for his industry. where it is today and where he thinks it should be heading. As he freely admits. his views are unorthodox for a cattleman. but I think they hold special interest for those of us in Congress who have been wrestling these past few years with the extremely difficult problems of the beef industry and rising food prices.

But. in spite of their sharp differences in outlook. they all seem to agree on one theme. They all recognize the existence of widespread lack of confidence in Government and the need to restore faith in public institutions. With this in mind. I particularly regret the decision of GILBERT GUDE to retire from Congress at the end of the current session because it is his very special genius to inspire confidence. Throughout his public career. in both the State and national legislatures. he has pursued his way in a calm manner. without raising his voice and without either inflaming hostile emotions or exciting unwarranted expectations. He has followed an honorable course. The five victories he has won in the elections for his seat in the other body confirm this conclusion. In each campaign he has persuaded the people of his district that he would thoughtfully consider all the factors necessary to determine sound policy and that he would do so without any personal prejudice or bias that could obscure the public interest. Today. when almost every official is viewed with suspicion. the personal esteem accorded Representative GUDE is both rare and remarkable. It is also well deserved. My friendship with GILBERT GTUDE extends over many years. but our close association was forged in the crucible of a tough election campaignhe was my campaign manager in 1964. For that. I am grateful to him. But I am grateful to him for far more. I am grateful to him for his long and distinguished record of public service to the State of Maryland and to this Nation.

I wish to call to the Senates attention a recent article in the Washington Star of January 11. 1976. by Mr. Sam Love. a writer in the energy field. entitled \"Does Capital Formation Create Jobs? It Depends on How You Use It.\" We have been hearing a good deal in recent months about the Nations unprecedented capital needs for the coming 10year period. It is almost a tenet of our capitalistic faith that ample capital is necessary in order to meet the needs of a growing populations. increased energy needs. and ultimately to provide jobs for the unemployed and underemployed. Mr. Love talks about quality and capital formation. The conventional \"trickle down\" approach of conservative economists and political leaders ignores the concept of \"capital quality.\" He says: An investment dollar. like a BTU of energy. can do any number of things: It can build homes. construct machines. bail out New York City or it can build nuclear power plants. It can go into telephone satellites which cost a small fortune to put into orbit. or it can build ground lines and pay operators salaries. Some investments create more jobs than others. Thus to increase the investment tax credit from 7 to 12 percent as the White House is proposing without discriminating among the corporate beneficiaries is no longer adequate. \"Policy makers must consider.\" says Mr. Love. \"what industries will benefit most from it? How many jobs will those industries create? How long will the productive wealth of the society be tied up?\" The selective application of investment tax credits might make sense if we can answer these questions. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the article by Sam Love be printed in the REcoRD. . There being no objection. the article was ordered to be printed in the REcOnD. as follows: [From the Washington Star.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. in the many significant aspects of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act. there is one section I believe is very important and should not be overlooked. I want to congratulate the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee for adopting an amendment to create an emergency fossil fuel rail bank plan. This proposal will insure the upgrading and continuation of vital rail lines near coal deposits and insure the delivery of this energy source. After all is said and done on the energy front. Mr. Speaker. I think it will be clear that we must rely on coal for our intermediate energy needs until alternate sources can be developed. To ralize this full potential we must start now to develop programs that will insure enough miners to mine the coal. proper safety to protect the miners. and. with this provision. the means to move the coal to its destination. The section gives the Secretary of Transportationin consultation with the Secretaries of Interior and Commercethe right to protect lines they deem vital to the national coal production. from the list recommended by the USRA in its final system plan. I believe this is a positive. logical and efficient step formard in our overall energy and rail plans. It was my pleasure. Mr. Speaker. to be the first Member of Congress to sponsor such a proposal. I was further pleased to join with Congressman JOHN HEINZ in introducing the bill based on the final USRA recommendation. And I congratulate Transportation and Commerce Subcommittee Chairman FRED ROONEY for the outstanding job he has done in preparing this legislation. and thank him for his careful consideration of this section. I believe the fossil fuel bank is a positive step. and I look forward to it being part of the final rail plan.",

I rise in support of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1975. which provides $6.4 billion to assist the bankrupt and ailing railroadsfunding which is so vital to the rail industry and to the Nations diverse systems of transportation. An unsafe. inefficient rail industry. coupled with deteriorated railway tracks. yards. and other rail facilities. is detrimental to our national interest and to our national defense. Mr. Chairman. the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. in its report. succinctly pinpointed the issue. stating: The problems of the rail industry are so deeprooted that to take any steps to create a viable rail system one had to move in a comprehensive manner. rather than a piecemeal approach which consisted of oversight hearings as well as hearings on particular pieces of legislation. This measure accomplishes this mission. It is comprehensive in its approach and design. providing longterm financial assistance to rehabilitate. revitalize. and preserve a vital sector of our economy. Along with many of my colleagues. I have been deeply involved and have supported the revitalization of the rail lines in the Northeast. Funds for this effort is essential in order to preserve an industry so vital to the needs of our Nation and so important to public service. The public demands and deserves a firstrate railway system. Mr. Chairman. this bill goes a long way toward contributing to such a system. Railroads which will benefit from this proposal in my district are the Penn Central. Lehigh and Hudson River. and the Erie Lackawanna Railroads. Accordingly. I enthusiastically urge my colleagues to support this measure.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased to rise in support of the Michigan amendment to be offered by Mr. BRODHEAD. My staff and I have worked very closely with the officials in the State transportation department on this issue. and I am delighted to have this opportunity to express my strong support of their plans to continue rail service throughout the State of Michigan. Michigan was particularly hard hit under the final system plan by the abandonment of more than 1.100 miles of track within the State. The State has put together a plan to retain service on most of this abandoned track. However. for their plan to be financially possible. the State feels that it must have the right to purchase some portions of profitable track as well as that which is being abandoned. The State feels that they can run the entire Ann Arbor Railroad on a nearly breakeven basis. However. a short portion of the Ann Arbor is included in the final system plan for inclusion in ConRail. This portion of the track generates very heavy shipments and is deemed essential to the operation of the entire State system. The amendment before us today provides a mechanism for the State to acquire that track. It provides an opportunity for the State to make a strong presentation to the USRA of the wisdom of its plan. I am convinced that this plan is essential to rail service in Michigan and that it would not significantly impair the profitability of ConRail. Its importance to Michigan is far greater than its importance to ConRail. Rail service is essential to an industrial State such as Michigan and I believe this amendment makes adequate rail service possible. I urge its adoption.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I strongly oppose the section of this bill which would commit the United States to make good any deficiency judgment that might be lodged against a solvent rail carrier which purchased any of the properties of the bankrupts designated to them by the U.S. Railway Association. This provision has as its purpose protection of the Chessie System in its purchase of portions of several bankrupt carriers in the MidAtlantic Region in.cluding portions of the Reading. and portions of the ErieLackawanna. From the standpoint of my district. the decision of Chessie to purchase only the eastern portion of the ErieLackawanna and to ignore the western division of this railroad led to what has been. in fact. a flourishing mainline being analyzed by the U.S. Railway Association as a branch line and as such to not be included in either the Chessie System or ConRail. The deficiency Judgment protection being offered for Chessie essentially means that this particular carrier is being allowed to purchase those properties it desires at the price it wishes to pay. At the same time. it is guaranteeing that if the special court finds the price to be paid too low. the Federal Government will pay the additional money offered to the estates of the bankrupts. I believe that this is neither good for rail competition nor good for the Federal treasury. The concept of rail reorganization contained in the Act of 1973 does not include bargain basement financing for the solvent carriers. and I do not believe that this act should contain those provisions either.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise to support the provision to include more loan guarantees in the rail bill to stimulate the production of railroad coal cars. It is obvious that planning to increase our coal production in this Nation to depend on less foreign oil. will do us no good If we do not have the coal cars to move the fuel. Let us look at the figures surrounding this situation. The number of coal cars in service has declined from 400.000 in 1970 to 353.000 by 1974. Meanwhile. only 7.100 cars were delivered last year. At this rate it will take many years to restore the coal fleet of hopper cars to the 1970 level. let alone expand sufficiently to carry the volume expected in 1985. The USRAs final system plan outlined expansion in coal production expected over the next 10 years. Based on their figures. a study has been made by Peat. Marwick. and Mitchell for the FEA which outlines the car growth that will be needed to carry to load. Hopper construction will have to be in the area of 9.000 to 14.000 cars per year for the period from 1975 through 1977. increasing to 17.000 to 27.000 for the years 1978 through 1985. Similarly construction of about 11.000 gondola cars per year will be required to handle the expanding demand during the 197585 period. Both figures allow for replacement of normal retirements. Given the present construction rate. and the competition for the loan guarantees already allowed in the bill. I believe we have to make the coal car production a top priority.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I will support and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the important amendment which will be offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts . to H.R. As all of my colleagues well know. the cost of shipping freight by rail has increased dramatically in recent years. and this has been due principally to the increased operating costs which our Nations railroads have realized during that period. The escalated rail rates have not occurred to the same degree nationwide. however. and this is principally due to the imperfect procedure used by the Interstate Commerce Commission in regulating rail rates. The unfortunate result of this dysfunctional aspect of ICC rate regulation is that rail rates in the Northeast are approximately 170 percent higher than those in the South. It is easy to see that this disparity in rates would effect an inequitable cost factor for industries in the Northeast which depend on rail freight. and which are in competition with their counterpart industries in other regions of the Nation where rail rates are less. To illustrate this problem. it is useful to note that for September 1975. ex parte 313 rates the cost for corn shipped from Toledo. Ohio. to Augusta. Maine. by rail a total of nearly 900 miles. at $17.25 per ton. The rate for a similar shipment across Southern Freight Lines is $10.24. Thus. in this instance. we have a disparity of $7.28 per ton. It is easy to understand the dilemma which raildependent industries in the Northeast must face in trying to compete with their competitors in other areas when these disproportionate rail rates this problem by graphic comparison of are taken into account. rail rates in the Northeast with those At this time I would like to submit the in the South. and demonstrates the widfollowing table. which further illustrates ening disparity which is occurring.

I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the distinguished career and accomplishments of Mr. Paul Howard. who this month is retiring after 27 years with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service. Two and a half years ago. Mr. Howard. in response to what he and many others felt to be a disturbing absence of minority involvement in the exchange service. recommended and subsequently established a minority office. Since then he has been the minority group officer for the exchange service. Through his diligent and sensitive work. innumerable minority businesses and manufacturers have been authorized to receive contracts with the combined Army and Air Force stores. One could not begin to estimate the large number of minority persons who haVe been employed as a direct result of Mr. Howards efforts. During this time of a depressed economy and massive unemployment. Paul Howard can leave no greater legacy than having found work for persons who otherwise would very likely be unemployed.

Thirtyfive years ago. July 14 and 15. 1940. a mock election of Sovietimposed \"peoples parliaments\" took place in the Baltic States of Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania. Passive resistance at that time to the authority of the Red Army. resistance which came in the form of an election boycott by many Baltic freedom fighters. was of no avail. however. as Russian intimidation forced most citizens to the polls. The lone slate on the ballot in each country. one comprised of Communists. the new Governments of Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania immediately agreed to become provinces of the Soviet Union and the free people of those countries have been subjected to Russian rule ever since. As we in the United States prepare to celebrate the 200th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence. the citizens of Estonia. Latvia. Lithuania and the other captive nations of the world can only dream of former and future freedom. For them. our independence represents hope. hope that one day they will be free of the shackles of unwanted communism. These brave men and women are prisoners in a society they did not choose. and they turn to us for inspiration. They can see the strength of our way of life as it overcomes internal difficulties like Watergate with justice rather than with repression and violence.

Nor should we abandon our efforts to continue to work for the freedom of these captive nations still under Soviet suppression. When the independent nations that surrounded Russias borders fell one by one to the Red Army. the eyes of their citizens looked to the United States as their one hope for emancipation.

Six years later. we extended the rights of citizenship to the Guamanian people. and they have played an increasingly greater role in American life and government ever since. Most recently. in fact. Guam was the center for the Southeast Asian refugees hoping to resettle in America. It has played a significant role in the effort to relocate these Vietnamese and Cambodians victimized by the years of war which ravaged their countries. The refugees poured into Guam by the tens of thousands to be processed and prepared for life in our country. Once secure in their camps on the tiny island. the refugees were able to begin their orientation in the society of their new homeland. The Asian refugees have gained new freedom on Guam just as Guamanians did through the Organic Act of 1950. the anniversary of which we observe today. The island has come to mean for the refugees what the Statue of Liberty meant for the European immigrants earlier in this century. It was the first American soil they saw. soil which represented freedom from the agony of war. Before the Organic Act. however. such freedom did not exist on Guam. In the 25 years since American citizenship was bestowed on them by the Congress. the people of Guam have enjoyed freedom which was unknown to them in the political limbo they were in after the Treaty of Paris of 1898. For 52 years they lived without the benefits of home rule. governed first by the American commander of naval operations on the island and then by the Japanese during the war. Thus the Organic Act was a landmark piece of legislation for Guam. and the Guamanians have certainly fulfilled their role as American citizens through their aid in the Southeast Asian refugee program.

Advocates of Federal legislation in this field surfaced in 1968. following a study by the Department of Transportation. which concluded existing auto insurance programs resulted in uneven and inefficiently distributed compensation. Supporters contend the nature of motor vehicle travel in the United States requires basic uniformity of insurance plans throughout the Nation. Individual States are criticized for failing to enact workable nofault plans. Many people believe nofault insurance is a legal necessity. They also cite examples of drastically reduced premiums as a result of State nofault plans. Supporters point to a reduction of accident lawsuits and faster settlement of claims as distinct advantages. In contrast. opponents of national nofault insurance insist the Federal Government has no right to intervene. Such policies. they claim. should be left solely to the jurisdiction of individual States. They believe this approach permits experimentation and allows a plan to be tailored to the needs of the State. The question remainsshould a Federal plan be nationwide in scope or merely set minimum standards. similar to what was done to control pollution under the Clean Air Act. The latest nofault bill is S. 354. the National Standards NoF~ault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. which was overhauled in the Senate Commerce Committee and reported out on July 15. This bill compromises between an allencompassing Federal plan and the minimum standards approach. National standards would be established for each State to meet or exceed. Administration and regulation of the insurance industry would remain the States responsibility. When a State fails to enact a plan. an alternative Federal nofault plan would go into effect. The proposed standards provide reasonable medical and rehabilitation expenses to accident victims. wage losses up to $15.000. and death benefits. They also permit lawsuits for losses not covered under a State nofault program. The merits and drawbacks of S. 354 remain to be roadtested before the full House and Senate.",

Mr. Speaker. the bill under consideration would provide for the Law Revision Counsel to continue publishing the annual cumulative supplement to the 1973 edition of the District of Columbia Code until the completion of the present 6year cycle in 1978. A new edition of the D.C. Code is published every 6 years with five annual supplements to keep it up to date. The 1973 edition and the 1974 and 1975 supplements were published by the Law Revision Counsel. When the Home Rule Act took effect. the duty of the Law Revision Counsel to publish the D.C. Code was terminated. However. the code is presently in the middle of its 6year cycle. and therefore GPO has all of the plates necessary for printing the three remaining annual cumulative supplements. The Council of the District of Columbia has therefore passed a resolution requesting that the Law Revision Counsel continue publication of the supplements until the completion of this 6year cycle. The Law Revision Counsel estimates that the cost for preparing the final three supplements will be approximately $120.000. and he has indicated that sufficient funds were previously appropriated to pay for this work.

Mr. Speaker. the bill as reported by the District Committee follows. in substance. the recommendations made by the Comptroller General and the District of Columbia Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Before an independent audit of the District can be conducted it will be necessary to get the Districts financial accounting systems in order. Therefore. the bill as reported first addresses the problem of designing and implementing new financial accounting systems for the District. The design of such systems will be done by independent contractors under the supervision of the Comptroller General. The Mayor will be required to implement their recommendations with the assistance of GAO supervised contractors. Once the new financial accounting systems have been implemented. the Council will be required to retain a certified public accountant to conduct an independent audit of the Districts accounting records to determine if the Districts financial statements fairly present the financial posion of the District. Such independent audits will be required every 3 years. The committee bill requires the District to pay onehalf of the cost of the GAO contracts to design and implement the new financial accounting systems and. in any event. limits Federal expenditures to $750.000 for each of the fiscal years 1977. 1978. and 1979. The District is required to pay the entire cost of the independent audit. I believe that this bill will serve three salutary purposes. First. it will enable the city to get a better handle on its financial situation and thereby improve its ability to manage itself more efficiently. Second. it will improve the quality of the information available to the Congress when it reviews the Districts budget. Finally. it will provide private investors with the information they need to evaluate the financial condition of the District prior to investing in District bonds and notes. Thus.

And yet no one can attest to the financial condition of this city. according to the Comptroller General of the United States. There can be no choice but for Congress to rectify this problem. This is unfinished business. This is a situation that the citizens of Washington inherited from Congress when they were finally granted home rule. This is not a District of Columbia bill. this is a national bill. Every citizen of this country has a stake in the financial solvency of its Nations Capital. It must also be remembered that Washington is a multifaceted city. In addition to being the Capital. it must thrive and grow in its own right. It is a vital partner in solving regional problems in the greater metropolitan area. It also operates on a State level with Maryland and Virginia. In all of these interactions. its independence. its ability to act as an equal partner. rather than a ward of the Congress. depends greatly on its financial solvency.

The Department of Commerce. unlike some other departments. is essentially a conglomerate of diverse. generally technical. programs.

At this time the congressional affairs function is carried out by a special assistant to the Secretary who is paid at level IV through an allocation from the Presidents pool. That space would be relinquished and a level IV for the new Assistant Secretary would be provided by statute. The new Assistant Secretary would be appointed by the President. with confirmation by the Senate. This bill is not an unusual proposal.

It is with that understanding. and only with that understanding. that I am able to support H.R. You will notice that in the report on this bill. the committee makes it clear that the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs should not become an obstacle to Congressmen or committee staffs trying to properly oversee the business of the Department of Commerce. Let me read from pages 2 and 3 of the report: It should be pointed out. however. that the Committee wants it clearly understood that the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs should not become a barrier or obstruction to Congressional contact and dialogue with other operating or resource personnel within the Department. Congress. in carrying out its legislative and oversight functions. has the necessity and the obllgation to know as much about a Departments operation as possible. Any Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs should guard against permitting his or her operation from filtering out information which is necessary to implement Congressional responsibility. The Committee envisions no set of circumstances which would prevent a Member of Congress or any committee staff member from having easy access to any operating or resource personnel in the Department who can provide information and assistance in the legislative or oversight process. I might add that present communications between the Department of Commerce and the committee often leave much to be desired even though not as bad as Health. Education. and Welfare. Perhaps the new Assistant Secretary will emphasize the need for the Department to keep congressional committees and Members on both sides of the aisle more adequately informed about the workings of the Department. The Senate has a similar bill before It and passage of this bill will mean that the Department of Commerce joins ranks with most of the other departments of Government in having its own Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs.",

William Robbins of the New York Times reported thatThe General Accounting Office soon will urge creation of an allFederal grain inspection system. saying that nothing short of complete reform can prevent scandals of the kind exposed in a broad investigation of corruption in the industry. Mr. Robbins also wrote that the GAO report. due to be submitted to the Senate and House Agriculture Committees on February 15. \"is said to urge combining in a single agency responsibility for grading grain and for monitoring the weighing of grain.\" I find this report extremely encouraging. Mr. President. The recommendations the GAO apparently will make should provide the impetus for the sweeping changes that are obviously needed and that have been advocated by myself and several of my colleagues. In recent days. the demand for Federal grain inspection has been heard in other quarters as well. On January 23 the Des Moines Registerwhich originally reported the grain inspection scandal last Mayreiterated its position. saying: The problems of the present grain inspection system are too extensive to be eliminated by partial reform. A fully federalized grain inspection system is necessary to achieve honest inspection. An editorial in the January 26 Washington Star expressed similar concerns. concluding that: The United States reputation in international commerce is too important to allow it to be damaged further by shortweighing. misgrading and even the deliberate contamination of grain exports. If It takes a closely controlled. allfederal inspection system to put an end to the abuses. this should be provided. On July 31. I introduced the Federal Grain Inspection Act. which calls for: First. the establishment of an allFederal grain inspection system. and second. the establishment of a new agency in the Department of Agriculture with authority over both grain grading and weighing.

President Ford signed the bill on the same day. despite protests from environmental and conservationist groups and veto recommendations from EPA. the Council on Environmental Quality. and the Office of Management and Budget. In passing NEPA and the Federal pesticide control law. the Congress established procedures by which the risks and benefits from this type of lethal control of blackbird populations could be responsibly assessed. Surely it is not responsible behavior to casually cast aside these procedural safeguards without hearings or floor debate or any practical opportunity for concerned Senators to voice their objections. In hearings before the House Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and the Environment which were hastily convened after the blackbird bill had passed Congress on consent. Dr. Melvin Dyer. a leading avian ecologist from the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory in Colorado. testified that mass killing of blackbirds may make the problem \"infinitely worse\" by upsetting the ecological balance to the detriment of farmersblackbirds are major predators of insects and weed seedsand may actually increase the number of starlings. one element of the blackbird population which also includes redwings. grackles. and cowbirds. There may be risks to public health from these blackbird concentrations which would justify the killing. although this hazard has not been established by the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. The point is that we do not know what the consequences of this bird slaughter will be. for good or ill. or whether it is needed. NEPA and FIFRA were designed by Congress to provide procedures to make sure we think before we act to disrupt the environment. The sleight of hand with which exemptions to these acts were slipped through the Senate suggests that their sponsors did not have enough confidence in the merits of the case for killing the birds to risk a Senate debate on its merits.

The Department of Agriculture has been opposing additional credits through international lending institutions. but the State Department has supported such loans in recent years.

Their concern is largely based on unsigned mimeographed literature which falsely claims that this measure would lead to the \"Sovietization of the American family\" by giving Government parental responsibility for millions of children. prohibit parents from providing religious training to their children. and give children the legal right to disobey their parents without \"fear of reprisal.\" These inflammatory allegations are absolutely and totally false. The material also states that a \"Charter on Childrens Rights.\" from the British Advisory Center for Education and the National Council of Civil Liberties in Great Britain. and the socalled \"Child Advocacy Clause\" are part of the Child and Family Services Act. This claim is again completely unfounded and untrue. Neither of these documents nor any part of them is included in S. 626. S. 626. a bipartisan bill. would make available parentcontrolled voluntary basic health. education. and other child care services. It authorizes a flexible system which would allow communities to develop their own programs according to their own needs on a totally voluntary basis. It would provide services for working people who need child care programs and want these opportunities for their children. but often cannot afford them. This legislation is widely supported by over 100 religious and civic organizations including the PTA. the National Education Association. the U.S. Catholic Conference. the United Methodist Church. and the Child Welfare League of America.

I feel that Members of Congress and the public should judge this measure on its merits. based on the facts. and I think it might be of interest for those concerned to read an editorial from the Cedar Rapids Gazette and one from the Minneapolis Tribune. which was reprinted in the Des Moines Tribune. These editorials set the record straight on the misconceptions that have been created. I ask unanimous consent that the editorials be printed in the RECORD.",

To try to prove my point. I put together the other night just a few items picked up from available sources to indicate that what the political contributions of the unions come to is not exactly small potatoes. For example. in just a matter of 5 months $34.200 was given to one announced candidate for the Presidency and this came from 27 different unions across this country. Other notations are similarly interesting and I ask unanimous consent that a compilation of these items that I have collected be printed at this point in my remarks.",

I can think of no more appropriate honor for this extraordinary man than the dedication of the canal to his achievements. When the canal and the great scenic beauty bordering it were threatened with destruction. two decades ago. it was Justice Douglas who brought leadership and commitment to the cause of protecting the canal and saved this precious landmark. If we are to single out the one person most responsible for awakening this Nation to the hazards of inaction while our natural resources dwindled and decayed. it is to Justice Douglas that we owe our deepest gratitude. And it has been our great good fortune during the most hazardous period of our constitutional history to have Justice Douglas guard our most precious first amendment freedoms with a fervor and courage unequaled in the history of this Nation. The extraordinary gifts and talents of Justice Douglas has led neither to arrogance nor narrowness. His spirit is as broad as this land he loves and as limitless as the individual freedom he cherishes. Our language is too pale to describe our love and respect for Justice Douglas. He illuminates the finest qualities of our peoplehumor and energy and compassion and courage.

Eastern Airlinesone of our major carriers which has been severely impacted by these pressureshas been able to reach final agreement with its employees and unions this past weekend which could well be one of the most significant actions taken this year by any corporation and group of employees to control inflation. The Air Line Pilots Association. the International Association of Machinists. the Air Transport Division of the Transport Workers Union and the majority of Easterns nonunion employees have agreed to a wage freeze which will save that carrier $46 million in 1976. This action helps the airline and the employees at a time when the most important consideration is to keep jobs and to bring the carrier through Its crisis period. In these times of economic stress the unions and management and employees of Eastern Airlines are to be congratulated on their demonstration of statesmanship and cooperation for an achievement without parallel in the industry.",

He spent many long hours and long days in trying to be as helpful as he could to his large constituency. By serving and pleasing his constituents and thus winning consistent reelection. BILL BARRETT served in the U.S. House of Representatives during 15 terms and was able to achieve major influence over national affairs. especially in his specialty. housing policy. At the time of his death. he was senior Democrat on the House Committee on Banking. Currency and Housing. and was longtime chairman of the Subcommitte on Housing and Community Development.

It is not exaggeration to say that much of the finest legislation to come from the House in past years in these fields was due in large part to the dedication of BILL BARRETT.

For the last several decades. the United States has spent much but planned too little for its domestic transportation system. From New York to Houston and Chicago and on to Los Angeles. railroads are in trouble or in bankruptcy. railbeds are in disrepair. airlines are financially pressed. the automobile industry is in decline. inland waterways are nearly nonexistent or neglected. Now the capacity to transport and the convenience of travel are both uncertain. This measure is intended to establish. at long last. a balanced. coordinated. and workable national transportation policy Such a policy must remake our transportation system. to make it as reliable and efficient as possible. The legislation addresses directly the disastrous state of our railroads. It mandates a major effort to upgrade. restore and properly maintain railbeds. tracks and signal systems. It will be funded from current revenues and the returns of the program itself. It will sustain a railroad industry which contributed nearly $22 billion in wages and services to our economy in 1974. Finally. this program represents a real breakthrough in using constructive public service employment to create work and combat recession. The bill will stimulate the economy in the most direct mannerby putting people on a meaningful job and paying them for it.

There is clearly a demanding need for a cooperative reexamination of the link between our experience in Southeast Asia and Americas posture in the world. Only this kind of reassessment can avert misplaced ventures such as our losing struggle to decide the outcome of a civil conflict in Asia. Doubt has been created both here and abroad about our future role in world affairs. If we are to address those doubts. we must first recognize that they are in large part a product of false rhetoric used to sell a mistaken policy. In his commentary in one of South Dakotas largest newspapers. the Sioux Falls ArgusLeader.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to commend to my colleagues attention a most interesting article from the Sunday Washington Post. by Mr. Wolf von Eckardt. \"Trolley. Please Come Back.\" Mr. von Eckardt makes the observation- and it is a very true onethat we acted foolishly and in haste when we replaced our streetcars with buses. We bought buses on the grounds that streetcars were \"oldfashioned.\" and that buses could be routed flexibly. Yet when we study most cities bus routings today. we find they make the same runs the streetcars made. In Europe. most cities still use streetcars. and. far from being oldfashioned. those streetcars provide better service than we get from our buses. Streetcars are electric. thus they are virtually silent and nonpolluting. Toronto. Canada. which is expanding its streetcar system. has found that streetcars are onethird cheaper to operate than buses and onethird faster. even In city traffic. I think Mr. von Eckards suggestion. that we bring back streetcars to Washington. has great merit. I am proud to say that the State of Ohio is currently in the lead in taking a new look at the streetcar. Dayton. Ohio. has applied for a UMTA grant to build a light rail system. which would be the first new streetcar system in this country in many years. Daytons plan. which Is typical of the forwardlooking thinking in that city. will. one way or another. be approved by UMTA. and Dayton will in turn be able to serve as a model for other cities across the country. Mr. President. if we are serious about wanting to reduce petroleum consumption and air pollution. there is no better tool to those ends than the streetcar. I. for one. sincerely hope the trolley will come back. to give us transportation that is not only efficient but enjoyable as well. Mr. President. I ask at this time that the article. \"Trolley.

It is not. however. unrealistic to hope that they will embrace certain fundamental characteristics that all nations should value highly: The basic guarantees of liberty and freedom. We should do all that is reasonably in our power to foster these rights. Yet we continually refuse to reaffirm these basic tenets through the ratification of the Genocide Convention. If indeed we hope that the best of our system will be transmitted to other nations through the force of our example. then we cannot hesitate to assert our support of these things to the rest of the world. While we delay. the convention is ratified by many of the very nations to whom we are supposedly offering an example. The list is embarassingly longover 80 nations.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the essential issue which would be addressed in this colloquy is whether or not we are willing to stand firmly behind the original intent of the Congress. It was decided upon enactment of the IPA that the Federal Government would fund 75 percent of the program only for the first 3 years. There was a thorough discussion that once the Federal Government started to pay 75 percent of the funds. the States would never want to increase their paymentswhich so often happens in grant programs. However. Members were assured that the 7525 ratio would only be a temporary measure which would allow the States to raise additional revenues to fund the program on equal basis. I submit that the \"breathing spell\" for the States is over and it is time for the States to take a hard look at the current programs to see if their benefits justify additional funding. If we allow the 7525 ratio of funding to continue. the States will never make a cost/benefit analysis of the program grants. It is time that the Federal Government stop funding programs that States would ordinarily have little interest in if it were not for the Federal funds. The philosophy which is so pervasive among State grant managers is that \"we cannot afford not to take the money when the Federal Government is paying $3 for our $1and besides. if we do not take it someone else will.\" I am offering an amendment which would allow the IPA to operate on an equal basis. It would delete the committee amendment which forces the Federal Government to continue paying 75 percent of the funding. My amendment simply allows the IPA to operate as originally enacted. that is that the States should pay an equal share of funding as of July. The Federal Government faces a deficit of $68.8 billion in fiscal year 1976. Certainly the States are in a better position to contribute an additional 25 percent to fund the IPA programs which State and local organizations have praised for being so beneficial and worthwhile.",

The U.S. Government as we all know is going into deficit financing. The overwhelming majority of local governments are far more capable of handling this cost than is the Federal Government. especially when we are increasing the overall cost of the authorization in this bill. We had great difficulty in finding people who would say. \"This is what this program has done. and here are the examples that show constructive results. When we asked for a General Accounting Office audit. we did not get back a Federal audit to show that the productive side of this program had accomplished very much. As a mater of fact the accomplishments were very meager. Yes. there were some areas where it had been productive. But in the overwhelming majority of cases we did not have clearcut. decisive results of the program. So in that regard.

The Federal Government is the one that is broke. The Federal Government is in the red. but we will find there were very few States in the United States last year that did not wind up in the black.

In its stead. language is added to specifically prohibit State and local governments. as well as labor organizations. from using Intergovernmental Personnel Act grant money to finance the costs of programs relating to labormanagement relations.

The Intergovernmental Personnel Act was enacted to provide assistance to State and local governments in improving their management competence. This is its unique purpose. The IPA is almost the only source of such specialized assistance to State and local governments. Even the acts provisions for grants to organizations other than State and local governments are carefully prescribed to insure that such training grants are made for and only on request of State and local governments. The subcommittee amendment would equate labor organizations which have no governmental responsibilities with State and local governments for which the act was specifically designed. To extend the IPA to provide financial assistance to labor organizations would take this program into areas far beyond those contemplated by the Congress in passing the act. In fact. the declaration of policy of the IPA is entirely devoted to stressing the need to assist State and local governments to develop effective systems of personnel administration.

I am glad the gentleman has clarified the point that this amendment would eliminate the opportunity for local governments to have their people trained in labormanagement negotiations. My city just went through a policemens strike. Had we had negotiators in the government. we could have headed off what turned out to be a disastrous strike before it happened. This amendment does not affect the labor unions. What it does affect is local governments and their ability to have trained people to deal with the work force. I think it is very important that we clarify that point. Had we had this type of funding available and these types of trained personnel. San Francisco might very well have avoided its disastrous police strike. Mr. Chairman. I believe this amendment would be a disaster to local governments and could cause serious problems in the labormanagement field.",

As chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee. as well as a member of the Finance Committee. I would like to point out that Senator MONDALE served as cochairman of a joint Small Business Committee public hearing on estate tax problems of family farms and small businesses on August 26. 1975. along with the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee . This was followed by additional public hearings held by the Small Business Committee on September 25. 1975. and extensive committee research on this subject. which resulted in the introduction of the following bills: S. 2394. sponsored by Senator MONDALE. myself. and others. A comprehensive Small Business Estate and Gift Tax Act. S. 2819. introduced by myself. Senator MONDALE. Senator HUMPHREY. and others on December 18. 1975. and Most recently. S. 3139 and S. 3140. introduced by myself and Senator PAcKWOOD. advancing the credit mechanism as an alternative to the exemption in providing relief. It might be further observed that a delegation of Small Business Committee Senators. including Senator PACKWOOD. Republican of Oregon. and Senator HASKELL. Democrat of Colorado. and myself. appeared before the Ways and Means Committee on March 16 to argue for action during this Congress. We feel that our committees work helped to crystallize the problems of the family farmer and the small business and encouraged the interest in the executive branch. which led President Ford to advance a set of proposals in January and March of this year. Now. at last. these issues. which are critical to the preservation of small business and family farm. and which had been buried for the past 3 decades. have finally emerged to the front pages of the Nations respected business publications.",

Mr. Volkert answered General Doughertys assertions that the B1 bomber will be built at a relatively reasonable expense and that nothing is more important to the national defense. Apparently the general was also critical of those who oppose the B1. I can well understand General Doughertys support for the B1. He is in charge of our bomber fleet. He should not be expected to see any bomber program in a critical light. That would be asking too much. However. it is not asking too much of the general to request that he rethink his criticism of the motives lying behind those who oppose the B1. To charge that B1 bomber critics want to wish away defense problems is the worst kind of rhetoric and unbefitting his rank and stature. His is not the only answer. Nor is mine. But those who are critical of the B1 are every bit as much concerned about national security as is he. The critics believe that producing the B1 will weaken our national security by taking vital resources away from other defense programs of more importance.

    "speech": "Mr. President. while the Senate was in recess for the Easter season. an event occurred which I feel is worthy of special recognition in our Bicentennial Year. April 22 was the 525th anniversary of the birth of Queen Isabella of Castille. Queen Isabella. as we all know. helped to finance the first expedition of Christopher Columbus to the Western Hemisphere. Although there are disputes as to which was the first expedition to the New World. it is undisputed that the discoveries of Columbus led to a new awakening of interest in Europe in exploration and expansion. Without this new interest the course of our history would have been radically different. Queen Isabella was a remarkable woman to place her trust and money with an individual who was considered mad by many socalled learned men of his day. Without the financial and moral support of this enlightened woman. Columbus efforts to turn his dream into reality would have failed. It is indeed fitting that in a year when we remember the important events leading to the creation by our Nation that we pay tribute to Queen Isabella. By recognizing the contributions of Queen Isabella to this Nation we can also recognize the debt this Nation owes to Spain and the Spanish people for their work in exploring. settling. and developing large portions of what is now the United States. My home State of Alabama is proud of its heritage from Spain. and Alabama was the first State to proclaim a day in honor of Queen Isabella.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Dayton Journal Herald of Dayton. Ohio. recently printed two excellent articles on the need for passenger trains. which I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues. These articles. one a column and one an editorial. outline some of the arguments for not only continued but expanded rail passenger service. I have been working for several years to get more and better passenger train service for the State of Ohio. Last fall. the first of my projects succeeded with the inauguration of the Lake Shore Limited. serving Cleveland. Elyria. and Toledo. Ohio. That train. within its first month of operation. was the third busiest train in the entire Amtrak system. It continues to provide service to over 20.000 passengers per month. The success of the Lake Shore Limited disproves the claims of some that Amtraks trains are inherent failures. in terms of numbers of people carried. Another Ohio route. the Broadway Limited. also usually carries over 20.000 people per month. The remaining Amtrak routes through Ohio have potential to equal this performance if they are ever given a chance to operate over decent roadbed. Trains on the ClevelandColumbusDaytonCincinnati and ClevelandYoungstownPittsburgh routes would have a great potential for commercial success. These corridor routes should be able to return a profit to Amtrak. just as the Northeast corridor route now does. I am continuing to work with the government of the State of Ohio to bring service to these routes. Other States have service needs as valid as these I have discussed in Ohio. They are valid not only in terms of the need of the local people for the service. but in terrhs of having the potential to haul large numbers of passengers and. in some cases. to return a profit. We need to expand Amtrak service to include these routes. not to cut back service by agreeing to the inadequate funding for Amtrak proposed by the administration. Mr. President.

Mr. Millers article conveys very succinctly what happened at Browns Ferry and why. It shows how the Nuclear Regulatory Commission failed to insure the safety of this reactor.

Just a month from now. the people of California will be voting on Proposition 15. the \"Nuclear Safeguards Initiative.\" This initiative would require improved safety in the nuclear power fieldespecially as regards emergency cooling equipment. evacuation plans and radioactive waste management. Also. very importantly. the Initiative would require the nuclear industry to assume full. normal liability for its activities.

It is estimated that approximately 27.000 persons have already received this credit but there are still 7.000 persons who. in my judgment. should be granted such employment credit. In 1955 Congress passed legislation which would have accomplished the intent of the bill I am introducing today. President Eisenhower vetoed this legislation passed by the 84th Congress. Subsequent to the veto new criteria for Federal CXXII1392Part 18 retirement credit for persons in the Agricultural Extension Service were approved by the Civil Service Commission. Through administrative action employees of the USDA received Federal retirement credit for previous State employment in the Agricultural Extension Service of their respective States. This action granted Federal retirement credit to 12.000 persons. In 1960 Congress granted such credit to employees of county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committees with the enactment of Public Law 568. This action covered 15.000 persons not included earlier by the Civil Service Commission. Now only 7.000 persons remain to receive equitable treatment. These 7.000 persons are Federal employees that have previously worked in 18 specific categories and performed Federal functions on federally funded and federally supervised projects. The legislation I am introducing today entitles these Federal employees to \"buy in\" to the Federal retirement system for the years they were not covered. The purpose of S. 3650 is to provide that service formerly rendered by a present Federal employee for a period when he was a State employee under a FederalState program shall be creditable under the Civil Service Retirement System. The employees of the following 18 types of such service would be affected by this bill:",

I am very pleased tb cosponsor a resolution submitted by my colleague. the Senator from South Dakota . which respectfully urges members of the Senate Finance Committee to consider and act upon S. 445. which I submitted on January 28. 1975. to correct an inequity in the social security system. The purpose of this bill is to disregard social security in determining allowable income for those receiving benefits from any other Federal or federally assisted program such as supplemental security income. SSI. aid to families with dependent children. AFDC. and veterans. Since the 11percent increase in social security benefits went into effect July 1. 1974. many people have found their total benefits have been reduced. This clearly was not the purpose of the social security increase. Our bill will provide that any individual or family whose income is increased because of subsequent increases in monthly social security benefits will not suffer a loss of or a reduction in the benefits due them under certain other Federal programs. Any individual who was receiving benefits for the month immediately preceding the first month the social security increase became effective will be entitled to any subsequent increase in those benefits and his total income will not be reduced as a result of that increase. Increases in social security effective July 1. 1976. will further increase the number of people facing a total reduction in benefits. rather than an expected increase. Each of those people have faced a reduction in their anticipated benefits. I am deeply concerned that so many Americans are suffering great hardships when social security increases should have meant relief. Mr. President. for these reasons I very willingly cosponsor Mr. ABOUREZHs resolution urging our colleagues to recognize this need and to act quickly on this vital measure to end the intolerable burden upon millions of persons.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I recently submitted an amendment to the Tax Reform Act asking that the joint income tax return be made a reality by having both partners swear that the taxable income. property and liabilities are equally shared. The purpose of the amendment was to focus attention on the discrimination against fulltime. nonsalaried homemakerswomen who choose to devote themselves to work in the home but who have no opportunity to benefit from income earned in the job force. Women who make this choice at the time of marriage or some time later in marriage must also choose to. become a totally economically dependent person. This is an economic group that should have been freed from their dependency long ago. My amendment asked that this discrimination be eased by simply affirming on the joint return that each has equal ownershipthus providing the homemaker with the financial backing of the spouse that is employed. The intent was to be carried out by the right to claim an equal share of the taxable income and property for use in investment. retirement plans. credit and loan applications. and the many other business transactions that require proof of income. This change would cut inheritance tax liability in halfby crediting onehalf of the property to the living spouse. While accepting the idea of needed equality for homemakers. many questions have been raised by tax consultants regarding the impact of this type of requirement. Because of the complexity of our tax system. the simplicity of dividing an earned income and extending the benefits tp fulltime homemakers appears to ha e raised some contradictory opinions. The question of possible abuse or nonacceptance of a joint affirmation by financial institutions must be clarified by further study of the impact of such an amendment. I am submitting a substitute amendment to my original amendment directing a study of fiscal and tax effects of a provision that would limit the joint return to cases where each spouse has equal ownership. management. and control of all income and assets for which any tax deductions. exemption or credit is claimed. It is my wish that by this study. many of the questions can be answered and we can be closer to allowing homemakers the dignity of economic independence and tax justice.

There is a severe shortage of capital in the United States at the present time. Our income tax system has served to aggravate the problem by affecting the willingness of people to save and invest. To the extent that income taxes take away part of the financial reward which flows from investment. it lessens the incentive to save and invest. It is therefore important to provide incentives for Americans to invest part of their income in common stocks. Widespread stock ownership among all Americans will provide capital. promote stability in the financial markets. provide individuals with a greater sense of participation in the free market system. and give them an opportunity to build a reasonable estate for themselves and their heirs. The amendment will allow all Americans. whether selfemployed. employed by a corporation. or employed by the Government. to establish a broadened stock ownership planBSOPunder which they will have an opportunity to invest in common stocks. In general. a BSOP will provide nonforfeitable benefits and certain tax incentives. Under a BSOP: Contributions will be deductible from taxable income. Income earned by the plan will be taxexempt. Taxation will instead be deferred until benefits are actually distributed. at which time they will generally be subject to tax at capital gain rates. Participation will be voluntary and will be restricted to individuals in the middle- and lowincome range through a limit on the maximum amount of the annual contribution eligible for the exclusion from income tax.

And. since this is a nonwasting use. an annual 10percent makeup should be assumed for this inventory. In addition to Dr. Kantrowitzs estimate. the Stanford Research Institute has prepared a detailed projection for helium use by magnetohydrodynamic generators.

The provisions dealing with congressional primary elections in the two bills are nearly identical. for example. The main difference is in the treatment of general elections. The KennedyScott bill provides for public financing of 100 percent of the general election costs of the two major party candidates. and proportionately smaller grants for minor and new party candidates. In this it follows very closely the system established in present law for public financing of Presidential general elections. The bill I am introducing today. however. continues the matching system for primary elections. that is common to both bills. into the general election. For reasons which I will go into shortly. I believe this is preferable to the fiat grant system of full public financing for congressional general elections the KennedyScott bill would establish. What is most important. however. is that a system of public financing of congressional elections be enacted as soon as possible. Senators KENNEDY and SCOTT and the other sponsors of S. 564 have made a strong case for their bill. and have done an excellent job of gathering support for it. I believe the legislation I am proposing has features which could make congressional public financing more broadly acceptable and hasten its final enactment. This. however. Is a matter for the full Congress to decide. I have worked closely with the sponsors of the KennedyScott bill on public financing legislation in the past. and I look forward to continuing our work together so that the best possible congressional public financing legislation can be enacted in time for the 1976 elections.",

I am pleased to cosponsor. along with the distinguished junior Senator from Wisconsin and the junior Senator from Colorado . a resolution which would provide the rotation of committee chairmanships every 4 years. For many years. the current seniority system has been subject to much criticism from both outside observers and from Members of this legislative body. because it rewards longevity instead of ability. I would be the first to say that most of our committee chairmen. because of their many years of service. are by far the best informed on the legislation coming before their respective committees. But. just as committee chairmen are experts in their respective fields. we also have excellent talent available from junior members which. in many cases. is underutilized. This resolution. if adopted. would move to open up some committees to a fresh perspective and should stimulate new ideas and concepts. The current effort by many Members of this body to seek a fairer distribution of committee staff is a direct result of the fact that. up to now. committee chairmen have been relatively free to do what they please. The fact that a chairman has unlimited tenure tends to deaden their sensitivities to the needs of other committee members. Under this resolution. all committee chairmen would certainly be more cognizant of the needs of their fellow committee members. because they would know that at the end of 4 years they would also be sitting at the other end of the committee table. If we are going to make this legislative body more responsive to the needs of the American people. then we are going to have to change some of our standard operating procedures. We must provide every Member of the Senate with the necessary tools to do their work as they were elected to do. We have to make every effort to insure that every Member of this body has an equal voice and role in shaping the legislation concerning the affairs of our Nation. A new feeling of vitality and life is now present in these Halls. and this resolution. if adopted. will be an additional step in making the U.S. Senate a more responsive arm of our Government. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin",

The resolution I am submitting today does not attempt to alter the power of a State to establish its own income tax laws. It does. however. clarify to the States that we believe that they are acting contrary to the purpose of the Tax Reduction Act and against the best interests of the consumer and the economy if they subject the Federal income tax rebate to State Income tax. The resolution clarifies our intention that individual income tax rebates paid under the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 should not be subject to State income tax.",

That is what the Finance Committee has recommended. with all the implications that has in terms of shifting from stimulants to restraint in fiscal policy. That could be a cold bath for the economy. which is not what the economy needs. I. for one. was unconvinced by the earlier explanation. And in reviewing the facts and statistics more closely.

This bill will enable the State of California to proceed with the agreement reached between Governor Brown and leaders of the legislature to provide additional cash benefits rather than food stamps to Californias needy aged. blind. and disabled persons.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a resolution urging the President to deny or revoke the general system of preferencesGSPto any country which aids or abets any group or individual committing an act of international terrorism. For those not familiar with GSP. it was established to give developing nations an advantage over industrialized countries in competing for the U.S. market by eliminating duties on certain products. The rationale behind this preferential treatment was that if countries could build up their own economies through trade they would require less foreign aid from the United States. Under the Trade Act of 1974. the President was given the authority to grant GSP to any developing country which was not Communist. a member of OPEC. or which had not nationalized American businesses without adequate compensation. Additionally. American businesses and jobs were protected by not extending GSP to \"import sensitive\" Items where domestic industry was already competitive and where preferential treatment would hurt our industries. Currently. about 90 nations and 2.700 products have been granted GSP. CXXII1551Part 19 Mr. Speaker. yesterday I spoke of the need to stem the tide of international terrorism by invoking the necessary sanctions against nations willing to aid or abet terrorists. We now have a law on the bookssection 602A of the amended Foreign Assistance Actthat cuts off American assistance to nations that aid terrorists. My resolution would make it clear that Congress intends sanctions against those countries that may not directly receive U.S. aid but that enjoy the advantages of such special benefits as GSP. This action would clearly demonstrate to countries like Uganda that we are seriously concerned over nations which. through their collusion with international terrorists. encourage these acts. endanger innocent lives and prevent criminals from being brought to justice.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Roman Catholics of my congressional district recently celebrated the installation of the Most Reverend John Raymond McGann as second bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Centre. N.Y. Bishop McGann succeeds the Most Reverend Walter P. Kellenberg. who served the diocese for 19 years and has recently retired. During his many years of service in the Diocese of Rockville Centre. Bishop McGann has held posts too numerous to mention. The parishioners of the diocese are most fortunate to have a man so familiar with their needs and their beliefs to lead them as bishop. Bishop McGann was ordained to the priesthood in 1950. after studying at the Immaculate Conception Seminary in Huntington. Long Island. He served in St. Annes Parish. Brentwood. until 1957. when he was appointed assistant chancellor in the newly formed Diocese of Rockville Centre. In 1959 he became secretary to the bishop. a position he retained until his ordination in 1971 as auxiliary bishop. In the homily delivered at his installation mass. Bishop McGann had much to say about the Catholic Church and about the future of the United States. and I would like to share some of his words of inspiration with my colleagues in the House of Representatives: In this Bicentennial Year. as our Nation rejoices in its richly blessed heritage. our Catholic bishops have issued a new call to liberty and justice for all. The liberty of which they speak is the freedom of the children of God. It is a highly responsible freedoma freedom that never shirks the grave concern that all men be freed from the burdens of poverty. racial discrimination. injustice and prejudice. This freedom rests upon the knowledge that all men are the children of the same Heavenly Father and all are called to love that Father and to love one another as His children. Mr. Speaker. I hope you will join me in reflecting upon Bishop McGanns words. and that they will serve to inspire us in our work. I also hope that my colleagues will join me in congratulating Bishop McGann on his appointment. and in wishing him every success in the most demanding job of spiritual leader of the Diocese of Rockville Center.",

But as the press in most cases did not point out. the Kiev may be a giant step forward for the Soviet Navy but it is not much of a ship by U.S. standards. The Kiev. which is not even in the same class as the \"midicarriers\" rejected by our Navy as too small and shortlegged. now shares the Mediterraneandescribed by some of our more dramatic military commentators as \"a Soviet lake\"-with two oilpowered U.S. supercarriers.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide seeks to make genocide an international crime whether committed during peace or war. Adopted unanimously by the United Nations in 1949. endorsed by every American President since Truman. and reported favorably three times out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. the convention nevertheless has failed to pass the Senate. I believe that if we reexamine the grounds for opposition to the convention. we will find that time and experience has proved the objections invalid. The Convention attempts to prevent and punish the destruction. in whole or in part. of a national. ethnical. racial. or religious group as such. The convention defines genocide and details the acts which constitute genocide. It specifies the obligations of the signators. the place of trial of the accused. and provides for submission of disputes concerning interpretation. application. or fulfillment to the International Court of Justice. The United States has both a precedent for ratifying international treaties and the test of time that the Genocide Convention poses no threat to our safety. Among the treaties which the United States has signed are the Geneva Conventions on the Protection of War Victims. 1949. and the recently passed Convention on the Political Rights of Women. Eightytwo nations have already ratified and/or acceded to the Genocide Convention. and none of these nations have fallen into the \"traps\" allegedly contained in the convention. The American Bar Associations recent approval of the Genocide Convention highlights the need for immediate Senate ratification of the treaty. The ABAs action eliminates the final bastion of opposition to the convention. In reversing its longstanding opposition. the ABA was persuaded by its section of international law. which very convincingly argued that Statements made in the past and raised in the Senate and the ABA House of Delegates are no longer pertinent. The passage of time has confirmed that genocide is a matter of \"international concern\" which should be regulated as an international crime. Acceding to the convention at this time is a positive step in the national interest of our country. I urge all of my colleagues to support the effort to ratify the Genocide Convention. I ask unanimous consent that the recommendations of the American Bar Associations section on International Law report on this treaty be printed in the RECORD.",

We supporters of nofault have tried to marshal the reasons why the one thing does not come from the other. However. I have yet to seek the task done as well and as succinctly as in a column by Phil Zinkewicz in the Journal of Commerce of Mr. Zinkewicz examines the recent 20percent rate increase in New York. for example. and shows that not only was it the first increase in the 3 years under nofault. but that even with the increase. consumers are still paying less than they did before the advent of nofault in the State. The column goes on to point out that part of the problems with State nofault plans come from too low thresholds that make it too easy to go to court for damagesthereby. in effect. laying the nofault plan on top of the tort system with the duplication of expenses. An additional problem comes from the companies still having to pay off old tort system claims while also embracing the \"quick pay\" nofault system. Mr. Zinkewicz concludes that most of the problems now being encountered possibly could be cured by \"the establishment of Federal guidelines with much higher threshold levels and more continuity of approach StatebyState.\" It is good adviceand advice which I hope my colleagues will heed in the next few days when we take up the nofault bill.

Anyone who was lucky enough to know Hap Kern would know how impossible it is to do justice to his wonderfully full life. His accomplishments were impressive. His list of friends long. Haps illustrious career in the newspaper world began some 50 years ago as an advertising salesman for the Boston Daily Record. the Boston Evening American. and the Boston Sunday Advertiser. which later became the Herald American and the Herald Advertiser. He was to retire on April 1. 1975. as the papers publisher. But his work \"at the paper\" was only one aspect of his life. So skillful and distinguished was his work that the Hearst family. owners of the Herald papers. reached out to Hap for assistance. Indeed. William Randolph Hearst named him executor of his estate.

I remain firm in my belief that services available to young children and their families are inadequate to meet the present need. The proposed legislation would fund a variety of quality child and family services. including. day care programs. part day and full day. parenthood education. and nutrition. While I am a supporter of this legislation. I recognize that in previous sessions there has been much debate in the Congress. and that many issues still are not resolved. However. the recent barrage of mail which I have been receiving. and to which my colleagues have also been subjected. removes the basic issues from reality. Instead. specious and unfounded claims are seemingly accepted as truth by those who have received and circulated an unsigned leaflet. This leaflet attributes and quotes a child advocacy clause which is nonexistent in the legislation. False allegations. inaccuracies. and distortions are the mainstays of this concerted effort to arouse the ire of the people. Regrettably too few can take the time and effort to investigate and challenge the issues of fact before adding their voices in criticism. The proposed legislation recognizes and specifically provides that child care programs must be totally voluntary. Its purpose is to build upon and strengthen the role of the family as the primary and fundamental influence on the development of the child. Suggestions that child rearing authority would vest in the State. or that parents would be prohibited from providing religious training to their children. are clearly refuted by the endorsement of this legislation by religious organizations across the country. Support for additional child and family services. and testimony concerning the increasing need as more women enter the labor force. has been repeated often in the many days of hearings held durIng the past year. An unfinished task remains to Inform the people on the need. for comprehensive services for the American family. As this is accomplished such",

The Soviets are putting an almost unlimited amount of effort behind their drive to increase military strength. Recent statements by the Soviet intellectual Andrei D.

These proposals. it seems to me. should be of direct interest to the Congress and our Nation. Mr. President.

    "speech": "I thank the Senator. Let me state at the outset what I understand the issue to be. or. perhaps better. what it is not. The issue is not whether we are going to have nondegradation. The issue is not whether or not the Senate is going to decide to have a nondegradation policy. The Senate has already decided that. The Senate voted against the Scott amendment which would have settled that issue. Those who supported the Moss amendment should not be permitted to express it in the terms of saying. \"If you vote for the Moss amendment. you are against the nondegradation policy.\" They are voting in favor of the existing nondegradation policy and against the nondegradation policy expressed in this bill. There can be no other rationale. There can be no other logic. So those voting for the Moss amendment are voting for the existing nondegradation policy. I think. as the Senator from New Mexico and other members of the committee. that this committee. after 14 months of very hard work. has come up with a better policy for nondegradation. that is better to administer. is more flexible. gives the States greater rights in determining their own plans. better opportunities to determine their own direction. with greater opportunities for industry to arrange with the State for the necessary permission to proceed under the plan set forth in theSenate bill. By all standards and by all regards. I think the Senate bill is an improvement over the situation under which we find ourselves now that would be perpetuated by the Moss amendment. I think those who voted against the Scott amendment ought to also. in good conscience. vote against the Moss amendment. If there is any logic at all in voting against the Scott amendment and for the Moss amendment. it must be on the basis that they prefer the regulatory scheme under the existing court decisions and under EPA regulations than they do under this bill. I voted for the Scott amendment for one reason and one reason alone. That is. that there is enough confusion in this body to persuade me that 100 Members in the U.S. Senate do not understand the issues involved. Under those circumstances. it seemed to me better to proceed slowly rather than quickly. and if we are going to have a policy. it not be the uninformed policy.",

The Presidents reasons for the veto are based on errors. misunderstandings. and a desire to retain authority in the executive branch which is properly exercised by the Congress. Mr. President. S. 391 is the product of many hours of hard work by the Interior Committee under the leadership of Senator METCALF. chairman of our Subcommittee on Minerals. Materials. Fnd Fuels. He has made a tremendous contribution to the development of sound guidelines for a management of the vast coal resources owned by the Federal Government.

The Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976 contains numerous provisions which will cause a restructuring of Federal coal leasing policy along much more logical lines. There are provisions which would end the speculative holding of Federal coal leases. place a limit on the concentration of holdings. increase the return to the public from the development of its resources. increase environmental protection. planning and public participation in decisionmaking. and insure the maximum recovery of the resource. In addition. and of special interest to my State. the bill contains provisions which would increase the States share of mineral leasing revenues from 37.5 percent to 50 percent. The additional 12.5 percent could be spent on planning and construction and maintenance at any public facilities and would not be restricted to only schools and roads. Another provision would permit the States of Colorado and Utah. where the vast majority of our Federal oil shale reserves occur. to use the moneys available to them under the prototype oil shale leasing program for any public purpose. with priority to be given to those areas affected by the development of this energy resource. We have been seeking these changes in the Mineral Lands Leasing Act for 4 years now. Development of western energy resources is increasing at a rapid pace. If our small communities are to cope with these developments in a rational manner. they must have the funds to permit local planning and the construction of the necessary facilities to accommodate large influxes of people. Enactment of this legislation will answer many of the questions which prevent the reasonable development of western coal lands. Passage of a Federal coal surface mining bill next year will complete the package and enable development of these enormous energy resources to proceed.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the following article. \"To Assure Full Employment Really.\" by John H. G. Pierson makes an important contribution to the current discussion of how best to achieve full employment with stable prices. His proposed system of economic performance insurance is designed to hold employment and consumer spending between preset. guaranteed lower and upper limits. Explained below. the proposal is well worth the consideration of all interested in this most important national problem. Mr. Pierson has served in the Labor Department and United Nations and has written extensively on this and related subjects. Some of his publications are listed below: \"Full Employment.\" 1941. Yale. \"Employment After the War.\" 1943. Department of Labor. \"Fiscal Policy for Full Employment.\" 1945. National Planning Association. \"Full Employment and Free Enterprise.\" 1947.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there is a growing cynicism within the general public for the medical profession. Many people believe that doctors are concerned only with their fees and do not pay as close attention to rendering quality services as they should. Articles such as the one below tend to increase and legitimatize these feelings. I believe that it is necessary for the medical profession to take a very careful look at itself. Perhaps what is needed is a redefinition of what a doctor should be. along with internal machinery designed to help the medical profession discipline those doctors who fail to measure up to these standards. Situations like that described below are occurring with increasing frequency and. therefore. this reevaluation is needed now to prevent these occurrences from becoming accepted behavior. For my colleagues review. I would like to place in the RECORD at this point an article which appeared in the New York Times of April 15. 1976. This article clearly highlights the need for the medical profession to take some prompt remedial action in the area of doctor ethics.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. no monopoly ever voluntarily relinquished its privileged position. Therefore. it should come as no surprise that the Nations largest monopoly. American Telephone & Telegraph Co.. has launched an intense lobbying campaign to stop the expansion of competition in the telecommunications industry. The origins of the monopolistic position granted to telephone companies lie in. the desirability. indeed the economic necessity. of avoiding duplicate telephone services. with duplicate transmission wires and the like. However. A.T. & T. long ago expanded its monopolistic position to include the manufacture of telephone equipment and the provision of special telephonerelated services. Antitrust decisions eventually made some inroads into A.T. & T.s expanded monopoly. and the advent of microwave transmission made possible the provision of special longdistance communications by competing companies. Naturally. A.T. & T. would like to return to its former protected position. and has mounted an intensive lobbying campaign with that goal in mind. A.T. & T.s principal argument is that competition will bring. not lower. but higher prices for telephone service. particularly for residential users. This line of argument is a familiar one whenever efforts are made to introduce competition",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as chairman of the Communications Subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce. I have long been aware thalt American broadcasting has grown up as a white. male industry. This fact has been of concern to me not only because of our Nations commitment to equal employment opportunity. but also because broadcasting is uniquely impressed with the public trust and interest. Under the public interest standard of the Communications Act of 1934. broadcasters program service must be responsive to the problems. needs. and interests of the significant segments of their communitiesincluding minorities and women. If this mandate is to have any real meaning. all significant segments of our societyincluding minorities and womenmust have equal and fair opportunity to be employed by the industry and thereby to contribute to its service. To its great credit. the Federal Communications Commission has recognized its responsibilities and has promulgated rules. policies. and standards intended to insure broadcaster compliance with the letter and spirit of equal employment opportunity. To its credit. the broadcast industry has made good faith efforts to afford new employment opportunities for minorities and women. Significant progress has been made as a result of these efforts. However. we have not yet reached the millennium. The FCC is currently engaged in an inquiry and rulemaking proceeding to reassess and possibly revise Its EEO standards and policies. I believe it is therefore an opportune time to call upon the Commission to reaffirm Its commitment to the goals of nondiscrimination and affirmative action. to maintain. apply. and enforce adequate rules and standards to achieve these goals. and to take any further action necessary to insure full realization of equal employment opportunity in broadcasting. I have communicated these concerns to the chairman of the FCC. in a hand delivered letter. and I ask unanimous consent that my letter be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

That margin is available for just three purposes: to relieve the tax burden on taxpayers. or to cover additional spending. or to reduce the debt. The congressional budget process. if it continues to work. will make those options clear to the clectorate as well as to the Congress. It is for the political process to decide which of those courses will be followed. The Senator and I cannot mandate that decision in advance. But. by insuring that the budget process is a healthy one. we can make sure that the political process. which involves the people as well as the Congress. will dictate the choice that is made when that happy day arrives. Mr. ALLE_ N. Is this projected balanced budget in fiscal 1980 a cherished desire or is that based on studies and reasonable anticipation of disbursements and receipts?",

The study assumes a continuation of the present economic recovery at about the present rate. which is 5.5 to 6 percent per year. Of course. whether or not that is achieved depends not only upon the budget. but upon Federal Reserve Board policies and actions in the private sector. If economic growth is different from the assumption. then the budget projection changes. I believe that growth rate has been a modest goal. It has not been excessive. It has not triggered another round of inflation. It is a \"doable\" kind of a thing If all of the factors which influence the economy come into play in the right way. The budget process in the last year and a half has indicated that It is an influence in the direction of coordinating all of these various Inputs Into the economy. I think It Is encouraging to the business sector. I believe It gives the Federal Reserve Board more confidence that It can work with congressional policy rather than having to fight it. I think we have a feeling of confidence that this new discipline is working.

The discussion which has been had was extremely relevant. I would say in a general way to my friend from Alabama that what we have tried to do is to state in this report the factors that we now know are under our control. We have estimated those which will be under our control. As we move down the road. we will have some very distinct options which are going to either move in the direction of that balanced budget in 1980 or we will be able to know. the Senator. myself. and others. in the areas where we have control. where we are moving off. We have pretty good indicators of what will happen in that budget in 1980. and we have it in one place. related to the functions of Government as they are related to the targets which have been set out. Obviously. we have to make some estimates. We have to estimate what will be the rate of growth of our gross national product. We have to make some estimates on what we are doing in the unemployment field. We have to make some estimates of the rate of taxation we are going to have. When one looks at those in light of the process. the predictions. and the goals. I think it is safe to say that at least we will be able to know when we are moving off that line toward a balanced budget. I believe we will know whether it is our fault specifically in terms of what we have done to get off. or we will know what has happened out in the economy. There may be diverse views as to who caused that. I do believe there are a couple of areas that are dangerous. They are the very outyear expenditures that are already in the law. -the socalled entitlements. pensions. those kinds of things.

In particular. it was interesting to note that the prime contractors attempted to influence Members of Congress by publishing employment and economic gain statistics in selected congressional districts. One such example was brought to light in an editorial of the Akron Beacon Journal. According to this editorial. Rockwell International had stated that the B1 program would bring $70.5 million in business to the Akron area. Ordinarily. Mr. President. these arguments carry great weight. Unemployment and business slowdown are concerns throughout the country. In this particular case. however. Rockwell apparently did not realize that its facts would be challenged. Representative JoHN F. SEIBERLING of Akron knows the B1 bomber program as well as any Member of Congress. He has been one of the leaders in the field. He has authored extensive research papers on the B1 and is thoroughly familiar with the complex defense issues that surround that subject. Therefore. when the Rockwell economic statistics surfaced in Akron. JOHN SEIBERLING went to work to check them out. What he found was quite remarkable. Even with a district that was receiving B1 contract support. he calculated that the residents there would end up paying $13.5 million more in net tax loss for the B1 program than would be received for B1 employment and economic benefits. The Akron Beacon Journal appropriately highlighted these figures in a recent editorial. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Journal article be printed in the RECORD.",

We have gone into area after area after area. So the gentleman is correct. All during the consideration the votes on the other side were to dilute the bill and water it down. and yet they come in and say now it is not tough enough. The fact of the matter is it is too tough for them. It is a comprehensive bill and it does the job. An additional point I would like to raise with the gentleman is we do not have full jurisdiction over the whole problem. The Commerce Committee is going to bring in another important part of the package in another few weeks and the Committee on Science and Technology is going to bring in another part of the energy program in another couple of weeks.

There was a representative of the administration present every day that we deliberated. The assertion that the Republican vote was solid on every issue. the records kept at least show that the Republicans were divided on many issues. I would like also to refer to some figures mentioned on what the import levels will be for the two bills. The facts from the FEA indicate that in the committee bill our imports for 1985 will be 9.76 million barrels a day. By the Presidents bill. they would be 4.2 million barrels. less than half.

I would ask the attention of the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. In January I submitted testimony to the Committee on Ways and Means proposing an alternative approach. It is certainly not a total solution. but it is one step in what I believe will be the right direction. and just as the Ways and Means Committee is proposing a tax on the socalled gas guzzlers. I proposed a tax credit on Americanbuilt fuel efficient cars. I pointed out that such a tax credit would stimulate Americans not only to purchase the fuelefficient automobiles. but if onethird of that market could be captured. it would bring about. over a time. a savings of 200 million barrels a year of oil. It seems to me that this is a less painful way to achieve energy savings.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to address my remarks to the urban Members of the House. There is no question. in listening to all of this dairy dialog that the American dairy farmer is in very poor condition. In the State of New York alone we have lost 10.000 dairy farmers since 1964. That is a very unhealthy rate and if it continues at the same rate. we will find ourselves at the mercy of foreign countries for our milk supply. As you may know. I have in the past taken a position against legislation to increase parity for the dairy farmer and to provide for the guaranteed adjustment of marketing orders. However. during the past few months I have had the opportunity to observe firsthand the impact that the current method of adjusting marketing orders and 80 percent parity is having upon dairy farmers. and I am convinced that unless we pass the conference report on Senate Joint Resolution 121. we will make it economically impossible for the small farmer to stay in business. which would be a disaster for both farmers and consumers. The legislation before us would raise parity to 85 percent and provide for the quarterly readjustment of milk marketing orders. The impact of this might be a small price increase for consumers. but nothing like the consequences of not taking this action. If we do not enact this legislation. many small dairy farmers will simply go out of business. as many have already done. This will result in less supply of milk and dairy products which will force milk and dairy prices higher at the retail level. In the light of these facts. I urge you to support the conference report on Senate Joint Resolution 121.",

I would just say that from my standpoint if this causes the price of milk to go down from having a governmental investment in this program. it will at least keep the open spaces around our metropolitan areas in northern California and help keep these small businesses. these family businesses operating.

I rise today in support of the conference report on Senate Joint Resolution 121. which requires quarterly adjustments in milk price support levels until March 31. 1978. and a minimum support level of 85 percent of parity. When this bill initially came before the House. I strongly supported this measure. for our Nations dairy farmers have had to bear the brunt of inflations impact on production materials without any accompanying increase in prices received for milk. In recent hearings which I conducted in my congressional district. dairy farmers pinpointed the many severe economic problems confronting them and causing so many of them to discontinue farming. Since 1968. the number of dairy farms in my congressional district has been reduced from 677 to approximately 300. This bill provides assurance to our dairy farmers that their Government is concerned about them and their problems and is seeking to do something to help them. The price support level. set at 85 percent of paritya level which I believe is soundalong with quarterly price adjustments. will help the farmer plan and organize his production at a more even rate throughout the year. Knowing that he will receive an equitable price for his product will also provide an incentive to young people to enter dairy farming. Mr. Speaker. it is imperative that the Congress provide a solution to the costprice squeeze confronting the dairy farmers. This bill is a step in that direction. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report on Senate Joint Resolution 121.",

I rise in support of the conference report on Senate Joint Resolution 121. the bill to provide for quarterly adjustments of dairy price supports and to establish the statutory minimum for price supports on manufacturing milk at 85 percent of parity. The 85 percent level is currently about $8.26 per hundredweight of milk. This legislation is the minimum that we can do in behalf of our dairy farmers. who have suffered a drastic costprice squeeze during the past 2 years. Over the course of this year. the Dairy and Poultry Subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee held extensive field hearings throughout the country on the depressed condition of dairying and possible measures to correct that situation. A day of hearings was held in Meadville. Pa.. in my district. on September 19. 1975. and some 300 dairymen participated in that hearing. Quarterly adjustments and more adequate price support levels were among the primary recommendations for action that were voiced during that hearing. During the last few weeks. the price of milk to producers has iricreased modestly. On the basis of current price levels. establishment of price supports at 85 percent of parity would result In no Treasury costs. since market prices are presently above the $8.26 level. Now is the proper time. therefore. to enact this legislation. Mr. Speaker. the conference report that is before the House today Is completely identical to the version of Senate Joint Resolution 121 that passed the House November 18. and I urge my colleagues to support the conference report today.",

A more than capacity crowd of dairymen and their families packed the courthouse for the entire day of the hearings. and over 30 dairymen actually testified at those hearings. The result of their testimony was unanimous. I might point out. Mr. Speaker. that this has been the only hearing held on Senate Joint Resolution 121 since its passage by either body of the Congress. There was unanimous and very strong support by the dairymen at those hearings who came from Louisiana and Mississippi for the passage of Senate Joint Resolution 121. They felt very strongly and argued very convincingly with fact and figures in hand that this bill was necessary in order to save the domestic dairy industry. I believe earnestly that the results of these hearings should be made known to the Members of the House in an effort to get them to accept the conference report and to the President in order to convince him to sign this legislation into law. Not only is this legislation important to the future of the dairy industry. which is the single largest agricultural industry in my congressional district and thus vitally important to its economy. it is also important to our consumers. We must do what we can to keep a viable domestic dairy industry less we become dependent on foreign countries for dairy products as we have done in oil. We should have learned our lesson with OPEC oil never to become dependent on a foreign country for energy or food. If the domestic dair- industry continues to decline. as it has done consistently in the last several years in my congressional district. then consumers will soon be paying a great deal more for milk and becoming dependent upon foreign countries in the process. I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this conference report and to do so in a manner sufficient to override a possible Presidential veto.",

This does not include aid from multilateral sources of which the United States was the largest contributor. This aid was usually defended by the rationale that while India might not always agree with us it was the largest democracy in the world and therefore we should give substantial aid.

Dealing in secrecy and utilizing the \"sweetheart\" contacts between USDA officials and the major grain corporations. \"The Great Grain Robbery\". was a disgraceful performance on the part of a Government agency that is supposed to protect and serve American citizens. Mr. Speaker. American farm exports are our most valuable economic weapon in establishing a strong balanceofpayments position. I applaud our industrious farmers. especially in the Midwest. who have produced when called upon. However. our massive trading in grain commodities must be done in an orderly and open manner within a vigorous free market. I have serious doubts about the present Secretary of Agricultures ability to accomplish this goal given his track record.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Subcommittee on Mines and Mining of the House Interior Committee. of which I am ranking minority member. begins this week a series of hearings to review the present legal system under which minerals on our Federal public lands are discovered. developed and. ultimately. brought into production. Among the acts to be appraised are the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. as amended. which applies to such minerals as oil. gas. oil shale. phosphate. potassium. sodium and native asphalt. the Materials Act of 1947 which provides for the sale of specific common materials such as sand. stone. gravel. pumice. pumicite. cinders. and clay. and the Mining Law of 1872 which permits individuals to search for. discover and acquire title to the socalled hard rock minerals. such as copper. lead. zinc. silver. gold and uranium. lying within the public domain. The distinguished chairwoman of our subcommittee. Mrs. MiNx. has introduced legislation which would. in essence. repeal all of these laws and substitute a completely revised system for public land mineral development. The Department of Interior is expected to send to the Congress in the very near future legislation which would revise the Mining Law of 1872. The hard rock mining industry. through its national trade association. the American Mining Congress. has drafted legislation to correct many of the outmoded provisions of the Mining Law. modernize many of its other provisions. and. in general. simplify administration of the current act. I am told that this bill was prepared by a panel of outstanding experts in the field of mining law and attempts to follow the recommendations made on this subject by the Public Land Law Review Commission. I think that it is important that the recommendations of the mining industry for changes in the mining law be before the Congress and it is for that reason that I am introducing this bill today. I am not prepared to endorse the proposal at this time nor have I made any commitment to support it in the Interior Committee. Like many of my colleagues I embark upon these hearings with an open mind. Therefore. I regard It as essential that the viewpoints of all those concerned with changes in our mineral development laws be before our subcommittee as it begins its important work.",

An article which provides an excellent summary of the best available materials on the subject appears in the April issue of the Sierra Club Bulletin. As author Heffernan points out. the number of jobs lost. or estimated as expected to be lost. is quite small50.000 to 125.000--especially when compared to the 500.000 jobs which have been exported by the multinational corporations during the past decade. On the positive side. several hundred thousand people are employed in manufacturing. operating and maintaining pollution abatement equipment.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the march of the antigun elements is again evident in the Halls of Congress. Since the passage of the 1968 Gun Control Act. they have prodded time and again for more militant legislation. Some are well meaning. conscientious individuals. There also are some who. for reasons of their own. want to take weapons away from all lawabiding. responsible citizens. They would accomplish this by oppressive legislation. including registration and licensing at high cost which. in effect. would leave only the criminal In possession of weapons with which to carry on his trade against a largely unarmed society. These things also are clear. There is an increasing crime rate in America. The police obviously are unable to cope effectively with this growing threat to personal security and property. There is no apparent improvement in the operation of the courts which free one criminal after another almost as fast as they are apprehended. There is continuing overconcern with the criminal and apparent indifference to the plight of his victim. It should be very certain that antigun legislation now will worsen rather than improve this unhappy picture. Nevertheless. antigun elements continue their chant for additional antigun laws and the militant leftist press solidly sides with them. Regretfully. they have the support of those wellmeaning individuals who are very sincere in feeling that more gun control means less crime. a situation which additional gun legislation has never produced. It appears that Congress soon will have to face the reality of new antigun bills on the floor of the House and Senate. It is time to study the facts and strip away the dross of sentimentality with which the antigun advocates seek to obscure their motives. All of this well stated by Merrill W. Wright. president of the National Rifle Association. in an editorial which appeared in the February 1976 issue of the American Rifleman.

It was only a year ago that Senator GOLDWATER. the ranking minority member on the committee. and I. wrote to Dr. James C. Fletcher. Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. requesting that the agency establish a program to develop the technology for more fuelefficient aircraft. NASA responded promptly to our request and. in consultation with aircraft and engine manufacturers and airlines. developed a plan that is responsive to our request. This plan was presented to the committee at a public hearing last September and later when we held 2 more days of hearings. As a result of its investigation of the aircraft fuel efficiency program. the committee made certain findings and conclusions and agreed on recommendations. These are included in the report filed today. In summary. the committee found that the aviation industry is facing a longterm crisis due largely to the dramatic increases in fuel prices. Research therefore should be carried out in a coordinated and orderly way to make aircraft more fuel efficient. However. the cost of this research is more than the ktircraft and airline industries can afford alone. and it is appropriately in the national interest for the Government to undertake this work in conjunction with industry. We also found that the problems of future cost and availability of aircraft fuel need to be addressed by Government planners. Serious study should be given to such possible alternatives as synthetic fuels from coal and oil shale. liquid hydrogen and direct nuclear propulsion. The committee recommends that Congress provide NASA with the funds needed to carry out a technology program such as the one the agency presented to us. NASA should take a flexible approach throughout the program and continue to evaluate the overall economic costs and benefits. The agency also should make reasonable efforts to assure that fuel efficiency technology is incorporated into military and general aviation aircraft as well as airline transports. NASA also needs to work closely with the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Federal Energy Administration to insure that future American aircraft will be compatible with available energy sources and that adequate provision is made for the future energy needs of aviation.",

At that time. I attempted to point out to this body the importance of establishing some stability in our dairy industry. We have seen the results of that instability over the last few yearsthe continued elimination of our dairy farmers in the face of sharply rising production costs followed by growing shortages of dairy products and rising commodity prices. I pointed out to my colleagues that Senate Joint Resolution 121 would have stabilized consumer prices and the supply of dairy products. However. as a result of misleading cost data provided by the Department of Agriculture. the Presidents veto was sustained. Another factor in sustaining that veto was the lobbying effort by Secretary Butz. He indicated that he was prepared to set the support level for milk at 80 percent of parity on April 1. and both he and the President indicated their plan to establish a quarterly review procedure. I can recall earlier that the Department was strongly opposed to the idea of quarterly reviews. but the idea now seems to have caught on there. The bill I am introducing will test whether the Department really supports quarterly reviews and at not less than 80 percent of parity. Today I am introducing legislation which would establish the milk support level at 80 percent of parity and with a mandatory quarterly adjustment of those support levels.

    "speech": "Mr. President. a large percentage of the 18.290 thirdand fourthclass post offices in many small communities across the United States are in danger of being closed. I have introduced legislation today that would make it mandatory for the U.S. Postal Service to take a hard look at these facilities before they are eliminated. I do not attempt to deny that the Postal Service is building up huge deficits with a great need to save money and increase efficient mail delivery. However. at this time. if the Postal Service followed the recommendations of the General Accounting Office and closed all fourth class post offices and onehalf of the third class post offices at a projected savings of $100.000.000. there is no assurance that all aspects of a rural communitys needs would be taken into consideration prior to a decision to close. The bill would require the Postal Service to consider four areas in addition to unprofitability of each post office. These areas are. first. the number of individuals served by the post office. second. the substantiality of the loss of revenue to the Postal Service if it maintains that post office. third. the proximity of an alternative post office. the energy requirements of individuals traveling to the alternative post office and the effect on service of that alternative post office. and fourth. the economic impact on the area served by the existing postal facility. Also. in order to keep Congress and all other interested parties informed on potential closings. the measure requires the Postal Service to publish notice in the Federal Register within 30 days of a final decision to close and at least 30 days prior to the implementation of any actions to effect such a closing. The purpose of this measure is not to prevent the U.S. Postal Service from saving money. but to insure that the people of small communities are given every fair consideration. At this time eight small post offices in Pennsylvania have been notified that they are being considered for closing. It is my hope that the Senate will move expeditiously on this important legislation.

This bill. while it is increasing the tax in 1976 to the automobile operator by 5/4 cents a gallon. is only going to increase the cost of a gallon of material to make this damned nonsense by 11/2 cents a gallon.

Mr. Chairman. if this bill even came close to dealing fairly with the problem. that would be different. I obviously object to the Presidents proposal to increase the cost of all petroleum but. if anything. his proposal is preferable to this one in one respect because the Presidents plan pinches everybody who uses petroleum. he does not pick on the ordinary family and the automobile driver to carry the whole burden. This is not a plea for the auto industry. I might point out to the Members that all of the automobile companies that have spoken on this issue have indicated they do not mind an increase in the cost of petroleum products. That is because there is a difference between those of us who want to protect the industry because we want to protect jobs and the consumers of its products and those who want to protect only the profits of the industry.

I think that in this section of the bill we have essentially a rationing program where if one wants to use his coupons. he can use them.

Let me say. in addition. that I am also interested in the automobile manufacturing industry. but there are tens of millions of other workers in other industries who also need petroleum so that they may remain gainfully employed. I am also concerned about them. I am concerned that they remain employed irrespective of whether or not the gas guzzlers in the minds of some people should continue to use up every available source of energy in this country. It seems to me that the gas tax that is in this section of the bill might just have some effect. Mr. Chairman. on reducing that gasoline consumption where there is more waste and more unnecessary use than in any other area of our petroleum consumption in this country. Therefore I suggest that the amendment be defeated.",

I think after 2 or 3 days of listening to the House. we have to come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as an energy expert within this body and probably not within the United States. We all have our opinions. and mine are supposedly as vested and narrow in terms of my own hangups as anyone elses. but I am that convinced that the plan that has come out of the Committee on Ways and Means. and the plan that has come out of the White House. in essence are very similar and have very few differences. Not one word out of either approach has ever been mentioned about doing anything to curb the need for the growing demand for energy in the United States today. We can tax all we want. We can limit the available sources all we want. But unless we do something to decrease the need for that fuel. unless we do something to broaden our base. we are going to totally miss the picture. and we are going to have a crisis in 10 years. the likes of which we never dreamed. Unless I see a bill on this floor that will do that. I under no circumstances am going to give it my support. I do not care whether that is guts or lack of guts. it is fact. and it is the fact that I am going to follow. In line with that. I am convinced that the approach of taxing gasoline is totally contrary to where we ought to be heading. We ought to start taxing those that caused the problem and not those that are victims as a result of having to follow something that has been laid before them.",

We either approach it through taxes. which would restrain the consumption of gasoline and oil. or we do it through a decontrol system which would leave the issue to the free market. the socalled free market. which I do not think exists. We cannot have a free market in a scarce commodity that is controlled by just a few. I want to say that if the Stark amendment is defeated. there are a lot of other amendments that this House could consider and should consider and I hope can be considered after the defeat of the Stark amendment. The Congressman. our colleague. the gentleman from Texas has a motion to provide a veto on any proposed tax. I had a proposal which would have put a 10cent ceiling. including the 3cent trust fund tax that was provided by the Stark amendment. I thought we ought to have a system under which the tax could rise above 3 cents. if we went into a system of extraordinary imports. There are a whole host of perfecting amendments that this House ought to consider. if it were not for the parliamentary problem that has arisen. I think it is unfair to this House to deny a vote on these issues.",

It is equally important that we pass the bill. after my amendment passes. as I hope it will. The bill contains quotes to reduce imports. I think we will be able to strengthen the gasguzzler tax. It is vital to the country that we pass this energy bill. It may not be the ultimate in energy policy. but it is certainly vital. The point is that we are faced in this country with the threat of increased gasoline prices if we do nothing. We are faced with threat of even higher increases in prices if the President continues his reckless course of adding dollar after dollar to the price of a barrel of imported oil. which also disproportionately affects the working class of this country and the middleincome people. It is a regressive tax. It is a punishing tax. but it still would be very significant for us to say we are going to limit imports. if the President says that is what he wants. We can limit this to a reasonable wellthoughtout amount with an allocation system under the control of the administration. which. if administered fairly. sees that no one suffers. If we broadcast to Detroit the message that we intend to see the corporate response to manufacture automobiles that will conserve gasoline. I am sure the public will do its part. and that the increased price of gasoline over the next 2 years will help cut down gas consumption. And if it does. then I would support the gas tax route to further cut gasoline consumption at some future date to make this country independent of foreign oil and energy selfsufficient in the long run.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I just want to address one point which has been made repeatedly. That is. that this is a regressive tax which is on the working people. Let me emphasize again that a husband and wife are rebated enough money under this bill. if it goes to the full 20 cents. to drive 65 miles a day. Now. if somebody has to drive back and forth to work. 65 miles is still a pretty good distance. If they drive less than that. they come out ahead under this rebate proposal. A study of the incidence of gasoline taxes shows that on the very poor. they pay no tax because they do not own a carthat is the elderly and others. but they get a rebate so that there is some redistribution of income. It is modest because there are not very many people in that position. but it is patently an absurd claim to argue that any tax is necessarily regressive if. in fact. the money is paid back to people in a way that is equitable and fair. I do not argue that the redistribution here is the most sensitive and most equitable possible way of distribution. but it is a good start. We have time before the tax could go into effect in 1977 to improve it if we need to. This tax. rebated fairly. limits the regressive aspects. This is the only thing in the bill that will cut consumption. If we take this out of the bill. we are going to be the laughing stock of America. and I dislike being associated with that kind of work product. The President has challenged the House to do well. and I would like to see us do well. I think that requires that we do face this responsibility squarely.",

First. if we want to conserveand we must conservelet us decide and know exactly how much conservation we need and are going to get. This proposal does not guarantee any level of conservation. in my judgment. we should establish a level of conservation based on a moderate and reasonable allocation formula. We will have the opportunity to do that when the Commerce Committee energy bill comes to the floor. The second problem with this gas tax proposal is that if we are going to raise money for a trust fund or for any other purpose. we ought not to do it by taxing the ordinary consumer once again. Instead. we should close tax loopholes for the giant oilcoalgas corporations which everyone recognizes are making tremendous profits as a result of inflated energy prices. That is what we should be doing if we want and need to raise revenue. So. the gas tax proposal does not stand up under the test of conservation if its purpose is to reduce wasteful consumption of energy. It does not stand up under the test of equity if its purpose is to raise revenue. Therefore. I believe it is not a good proposal.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the Stark amendment. the 3centonly tax. I wish to speak very quickly on some of the economic effects of the gas tax because I think there is a good deal of misunderstanding. Of course. there would not be any effect at all until well into 1977 except for the 3 cents. The 5 to 20 cents tax would not begin to come in until then. Also let me remind the Members that it will come in only if gasoline consumption increases over a very high year. 1973. I remind the Members also that over 80 percent would be rebated anyway to all persons over 16 years old. and there would be exemptions for farmers. for State and local governments. for trucks over roughly a quarter ton. and so forth. This Ways and Means tax that is being attacked here will cost the consumer less and save more gasoline. considerably more. than the Presidents program. Regarding any reduction of gas consumption in response to price increase after a couple of years. the best economic estimates indicate that a 20percent increase in price should be accompanied by a 10percent decrease in consumption. That would be significant. The gas tax. of course. should be viewed as only one part of an interlocking set of parts in this bill. You cannot look at that alone and make an appraisal of the whole bill. In summary. the economic effects of the committees tax would not be onerous yet the incentive to consume less gas would definitely be there. A final word on the proposal made by several of my freshman colleagues that the use of allocation and direct measures to reduce consumption would be helpful as a part of the whole program. I agree. Let us try 55 mileperhour limits. gasless Sundays. jawboning. and so forth during the next couple of years before the gas tax would take hold. If these measures work. the gas tax would not be triggered in at all. Even if these measures succeed only partially in preventing a rise in gas consumption. this much conservation would be all to the good.",

I think that if we examine this issue carefully. we will see that there is absolutely no contradiction between the Convention and the first amendment. The case of Brandenburg against Ohio. heard by the Supreme Court in 1969. defines incitement about the same way the Genocide Convention does. It says that incitement under our Constitution is not mere advocacy. The Court said that we ought to permit advocacy of any doctrine unless that advocacy is likely to produce unlawful actions. Incitement is only action that is directed to producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. The significance of this distinction is that the reference in article III of the Convention to \"direct and public incitement to commit genocide\" is perfectly consistent with our first amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Brandenburg and other cases. The question has also been raised as to whether a treaty can override the clear commands of our Bill of Rights. and specifically the first amendment. The Supreme Court has decided this several times. and in Reid against Covert makes it clear that no provision in a treaty could override the clear commands of the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Mr. President. like so many of the objections to the Genocide Convention. this objection based on conflict with the first amendment is plainly at variance with the facts. If we look at all the facts.

More and more we are finding out that peoples health is dependent not only on quality health care but also on economic status. education. housing. nutrition. sanitation. and the environment. A Joint Economic Committee study has revealed startling new scientific evidence that directly relates heart disease. stroke. suicides. mental illness. alcoholism and kidney failure to the emotional stresses of unemployment.

But more must be done. The American Medical News recently reported thatOne dollar of every nine earned by the average American family now goes for health care and the share is rising. In spite of this. the administration continues to propose cutbacks in programs which vitally affect the quality of life and health in our Nation.

This legislation. which was originally implemented by the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare but is now the responsibility of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. is achieving the goal which Congress intended. In 1972. safety packaging requirements for aspirin took effect. Since that period. the number of aspirin poisoning deaths among children under the age of five has declined by 48 percent according to the National Center for Health Statistics. According to a recent Washington Star article. the Department of Pediatrics at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma.

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of the most constructive elements of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. in terms of the Nations shortterm directions and longterm objectives in regard to unemployment is the National Commission for Manpower Policy established under title V of that act. The Commission. which is chaired by Eli Ginzberg. professor of economics at Columbia Universitya distinguished authority on manpower programsconsists of 17 members including public officials. representatives of labor. industry. commerce. and education. persons served by manpower programs. and State and local officials who have responsibility for manpower programs. The functions of the Commission include identification of manpower goals and needs of the Nation. examination and evaluation of the effectiveness of federally funded manpower programs. and related activities. The Commission has transmitted to the Congress its first \"Interim\" report. dated February 28. 1975. entitled \"The Challenge of Rising Unemployment\" setting forth a number of preliminary conclusions and recommendations on the responsiveness of manpower and manpowerrelated programs to the very serious developing unemployment situation. This report. coming only 3 to 4 months after the Commission was fully underway. is presented with a commendable awareness of purpose and a sense of urgency on the part of the Commission. As noted in the report itself: In other circumstances. the Commission would have waited before submitting its first report. However. because of the unprecedented increase in unemployment between August and January when the national rate advanced from 5.4 to 8.2 or by more than 50 percent. the Commission considered it desirable to make a preliminary assessment of the manpower outlook for 1975 available at this time.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. Americas need to defend herself against possible enemies will not disappear in the foreseeable future. nor will the Defense Department budget requests for over $100 billion in total obligational authority. This being the case I think that those of us who are concelned about the costs of operating at the Pentagon would do well to remember that these costs are not likely to go down any time soon. if ever. This was made starkly clear in an article in the March 1975 issue of the Armed Forces Journal written by Thomas C. Steinhauser. His premise is that the $104 billion authority being asked for defense purposes in the fiscal year 1976 looks big now. but it will look small by 1980. He estimated that in 5 years the Pentagons requirements will cost $148 billion. He explained: The new budget request represents the first increase the Department of Defense has requested in real obligatorial authority in nine years. Nevertheless. it is still smaller than the amount projected last year for the fiscal year 1976 in the Department of Defenses rolling 5year defense plan. Moreover. it represents the smallest defense burden on American society since Pearl Harbor. measuring the budget as a percent of gross national product. Mr. President. because of the running controversy over defense costs in this country. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Steinhausers article entitled. \"Department of Defense Asks First Real Budget Increase in 9 Years.\" be printed in the RECORD.",

My latest letter to the Department was transmitted on February 12. 1975. and the response has just arrived. * Of particular interest. I should note that a change in the Defense Industrial Security Program has been effected as a result of this congressional inquiry. Changes in the administration of the program would require companies subject to the program to give the Department advance notification of serious offers of significant investment rather than wait until a foreign investment is made. I am pleased that the change is contemplated and would urge that it be implemented at the earliest feasible date. This defense area is the most sensitive one for foreign investment. Tightening administrative provisions on foreign control of defense contractors will go far toward alleviating the pressures for restrictions on all foreign investment.

Antonia Spinola. ostensibly at the head of the revolutionary forces. be able to consolidate Portugal into a democratic government on a par with others of Western Europe? Today. we know that the answer is a firm \"no.\" After the events of this week. it is clear beyond doubt that the authoritarian regime of Caetano has been replaced with a Red military dictatorship which primarily relies on the Communist Party of Portugal and Communist sympathizers. The oncemurky postrevolution picture became clearer with these recent events. and from the announcements which came from the Marxist military in power and their Communist allies. The upcoming spring election is a big question mark. Unless the ruling \"Revolutionary Council\" is given a permanent voice in running the country. the elections will be postponed. All political parties associated with the old Caetano regime have been outlawed. along with any and all parties to the right of the Socialists. including the Christian Democratic Party. To satisfy the Communist Party of Portugal. which is the most loyal Soviet Communist Party satellite in Western Europe. their Maoist competitors have been also outlawed. Londons Daily Telegraph has labeled the new regime a \"military dictatorship dominated by the Communist Party.\" Portugals first goaround under the democratic rules was a liberals \"pipe dream.\" and for the Communists and their allies. an expertly performed act of subversion. One needs only to refer to the similarity of the election symbols in four leftwing parties. all of which have a hammer and sickle on their banners. to understand the tone and nature of the political atmosphere. It was announced from the top level that the new constitutional assembly would not be a decisonmaking body. but a mere assembly for deliberations. Now it is quite clear that the Marxist military and the Communist Party boss. Cunhal. and not the people. will be the pillar of political sovereignty. It was a quest for power and Communist advice which guided the Revolutionary Councils had in this preliminary decision.",

The measure of what makes something succeed is not this narrow. and it cannot be quantified. Often. it is the spirit and character of an undertaking that give it the catalyst to succeed. I am thinking when I say this of St. Vincent Hospital and Medical Center. in suburban Portland. Oreg. This organization is nearing its 100th birthday. As this date nears. I want to mention this spirit and character. for they have helped so much in the hospitals early years. and still provide the thrust for what I trust will be a second century of service to the people of Oregon. A hospital is more than a collection of buildings. it is more than people who do only the letter of their job. What sets a hospital apart and helps shape the character of the institution. is its commitment to service in human terms. its sensitivity. its understanding of community needs and Its ability to meet these needs. These terms can well be used to describe St. Vincent Hospital and Medical Center. I look forward to joining a former distinguished Member of this body. Hon. Hall Lusk and others on July 19. during the honoring of the Feast of St. Vincent. when the milestone date of 100 years is reached.

In an article in the New York Times recently. the activities of Giant Foods In the consumer area are described. and I want to call attention to them. For most Members of this body. and their staffs. the steps Giant Foods has taken are well known locally. To readers of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD around the country. and to the other grocery chain operators. this shows what responsible business leadership can do in meeting many problems consumers face. To use the jargon of the moment. this good consumerism has \"bottom line\" benefits to companies as well. Businessmen and women must recognize that good consumerism pays off in added business for the concern. I know members of my staff who patronize Giant whenever possible solely because of their progressive consumer stands. Their warnings on products that could be mistaken by children is an example where the message is so clear a warning to parents of young children that some poisonous substances should be avoided in colored or perfumed scents so as not to attract small children. Tlis is but one example of many where Giant Foods has taken the lead. at least locally. in good consumerism. I ask unanimous consent that this article. from the March 24. 1975.

It is indeed a difficult tightrope to walk to draft a provision which will make government more accountable for its errors while at the same time not chill the agency into immobility. As I interpret the intent of Mr. BucxLEYS amendment. he is attempting to grant a cause of action to an aggrieved party who may be injured primarily due to an administrative error by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In the Marlin toy case. the Commission inadvertently continued to list the product of that company which had once been banned and kept it on the banned toy list after the products design had been altered. Further. the Commission refused to distribute an amended list. Whether or not this error was the proximate cause of 4he companys financial difficulties is up to others to determine. The issue under the Buckley amendment as applied to the Marlin toy case would be whether the Commissions refusal to amend its \"banned toy list\" was an unreasonable eizercise of discretion. Clause 2 of the proviso of the amendment is designed to Insure that this section will not be used as a mechanism for reriewing agency actions such as rulemakings. standards. orders. licenses. sanctions. relief or the equivalent or denial thereof. This section is designed only to afford a means of redress where the agencys mistake is not \"ministerial\" in the strict sense of the term and where its discretion. in issues relating to other than an agency action was unreasonable.

It is just another in a series of putting these agencies on notice that cost benefits and economic impacts are vital for them to consider and then to give that information to whoever is interested in it by filing it appropriately. That interest might be ours. it might be the publics. it might be a consumer group. and it might be those who manufacture the product or the beneficiaries of the new safety imposed regulation.

This amendment is an attempt to avoid that lag in time. It does not. obviously. affect the transfer of authority from the CPSC to the EPA. The quicker EPA actually issues the regulations the quicker the jurisdiction within the Consumer Product Safety Commission will disappear. It is clear to me that the purpose is to avoid any lag in time which might otherwise occur and. therefore. I hope the amendment will be accepted. I have had a chance to explain this briefly to the manager of the bill. and I hope it will be accepted.",

As the Members know. the Internal Revenue Service has undertaken a 10year investigation as to secret bank accounts in the Bahamas. Also we are very much aware of the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars of American money from possibly illegal sources is being sent to these countries and we are unable to trace it and we are unable to find out what the loss of tax revenues to the Treasury is.

There were some minor changes made only in the technical language. but the basis is essentially the same. During debate on my amendment on the economic aid and food assistance bill earlier. some Members said that it did not go far enough in protecting human rights. and some said it went too far. I did not want to do either. I do not think that we want to absolutely tie the hands of any of our programs or any of the administrators of our programs so that it would actually hurt the needy people more than it would help. So. I left the provision in this amendment as in the earlier one. that the Governor. for example. can give information as to how such assistance will benefit those people. Again. I do not want to make it so rigid and so ironclad as to strangle the operation of the InterAmerican Development Bank. but I do want. and I think we all want the world to know that if the United States stands for anything in the world arena. it stands for upholding basic human rights. People may wonder where this language was taken from. The basic language in subparagraph (a) is from the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations Charter.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. public officials. indeed the entire governmental structure. are often negligent in recognizing the contributions made to our society by the business community in general. and specific industries in particular. I want to take this occasion to recognize one important segment of the construction industry in Santa Clara County. Calif. I am referring to the sheet metal. heating. and air conditioning industry. The Santa Clara district chapter of the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National AssociationSMACNAcomposed of 30 members and represents approximately threefourths of all work done in this field in Santa Clara. Santa Cruz. and San Benito Counties. Nationally. SMACNA is an organization dedicated to furthering the goals of the industry in areas such as legislative affairs. research and development. continuity of standards. standards organization. and maintenance of services. The Santa Clara district chapter has been involved in numerous activities including the following: Training of more than 100 apprentices in 1974 under the local apprentice training committee. Conducting CAL/OSHA selfcompliance and total loss control programs. Conducting a regional sheet metal apprentice contest in San Jose. Holding an estate planning seminar. Sponsoring an employee buyout program. Promoting continuing inplant safety inspections. and Participating in numerous high school career days. I have chosen to recognize this deserving industry. Mr. Speaker. for many reasons. but two among those require special attention. First of all. the Nations economic ills. which have been magnified in Santa Clara County. have dealt a crunching blow to the entire construction industry. Those of us in positions of leadership must take advantage of every opportunity to assist this vital element of the economy. and restore public confidence in our ability to do something positive to achieve necessary changes. Second. the crying need to implement energy conservation measures will necessarily result in increased research activities in the heating. air conditioning. sheet metal. and insulation industries. I am confident SMACNA will be working with the Congress as we seek to find effective and fair solutions to the critical problem of energy conservation.",

I also feel strongly that they have a right to a full disclosure of this fund and how it is used. I placed before my colleagues and the public a detailed explanation of the type of expenses I believe could properly be covered by such a fund. the method by which I intended to raise the money and a lengthy opinion froth the Internal Revenue Service which I solicited to make sure the fund met every legal and ethical requirement. Last August. I placed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a complete accounting of the operation of the funds for the first 6 months. I would now like to offer to my colleagues and the public a report on the first full year of this constituent service fund. It has been of tremendous value in enabling me to maintain the kind of service and communications I feel are my responsibility as a representative of the people of my district and I also wish to express my gratitude to the many contributors who have made the program a success. The basic structure of the fund is based on a maximum $200 subscription from any individual and also benefits from miscellaneous contributions ranging from $1 upward. The following represents a full accounting of the operations of my constituent service fund from January 1. 1974 to December 31. 1974: RECEIPTS Miscellaneous receipts from constituents ranging from $1.00 to $100.00 ------------------------$178.00 Thirtyfive members at $200.00 fully paid --------------------7. 0.00 Four (onehalf year paid at $100.00) second onehalf year balance due ---------------------------400.00 Total --------------------- 7.578.00",

This brings to 101 the number of Members who have joined in introducing this legislation. If enacted. the bill would save the U.S. Government between $350 and $400 million a year by requiring the payment of interest on deposits of the taxpayers money in \"tax and loan accounts\" in commercial banks throughout the country. In recent years. the average balance in the accounts .has averaged around $4 billion. That money sits in the banks without earning 1 cent of interest for the taxpayers until the Government withdraws it. Instead of investing that money to help pay off the national debt or making it available to the taxpayers. the Government allows the banks to invest it and reap high rates of interest. not for the taxpayers but for the banks. In recent months. the Treasury has drawn down its accounts in commercial banks more quickly. possibly in response to mounting criticism of the tax and loan account system. But certainly we still need some kind of clearcut rules to prevent this careless management of the taxpayers money. I am very pleased to note that. in the past several weeks. bills similar to the Tax and Loan Account Interest Act have been introduced by the chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee . the former chairman of that committee . and by the chairman of the Senate Banking.

During Minuteman Month. National Guard stations across the country will be encouraging the public to visit their facilities and get to know the National Guardsmen servicing their area. It is also a time when we as a nation can pay special tribute to our National Guard for its constant readiness and vigilance to protect our security during times of need. In line with observing Minuteman Month. I had the pleasure recently to visit an Air National Guard Station in my district. in Roslyn. N.Y. The Roslyn Air National Guard Station presently serves as a communications and electronic training site. Indeed. it is perhaps the largest and finest nonflying base in the Air National Guard. I was especially impressed by the excellence of the Roslyn Stations facilities and by the high calibre of the personnel stationed there. The Roslyn base has. for instance. a highly sophisticated system for tracking aircraft. in the event of an air raid. the base would be ready in an instant to protect the community and its security. During World War II. the base was used as an air defense post of the First Fighter Command. Later. from 1948 until 1959. the site was the home of the 26th Air Divisions Air Defense Control Center. which controlled the air defense of the entire Northeast. Today. the Roslyn Air National Guard Station carries on a tradition of service to the country. it performs vital functions of which the surrounding communities and we as a nation can be proud. On the occasion of Minuteman Month I would like to extend my own gratitude to the Roslyn Air National Guard Station for a job well done.

Jerry Fink. news editor of the Sequoyah County Times. said: Fine was a selfproclaimed representative of those who are often overlooked . . . His honesty and sincere concern for the rural people of his district made him a formidable opponent to all ambitious politicians who sought his chair. He never lost an election. Fink noted that Fines early life was a \"struggle for existence.\" He skinned rabbits. possums. skunks. and coons. picked strawberries and cotton. served as a hotel porter and janitor and raised hogs. He also was a World War II prisoner of war. He was a teacher and a rancher and finally served 30 years in the Oklahoma Legislature. Mr. Speaker.

While I understand that the primary intent of this move is to save mcney. estimated at a $215 million reduction in the current fiscal year. I believe this represents a false economy. particularly when you consider the administrative burden which will certainly occur in recalculating purchase requirements for some 5 million households. Beyond the question of economics. however. I believe it is imperative that the USDA consider the fact that the heaviest burden of the higher purchase requirements will be borne by elderly poor households. Some 1.5 million elderly poor currently participate in the food stamp program and I find it totally unacceptable that the USDA should expect their already meager resources to ba further eaten away in order to secure at least one decent and nutritious meal a day. In addition. because minimum monthly benefits would be eliminated from the food stamp program. there will be much less of an incentive to participate in it. This. too. is not acceptable in light of the millions of Americans who are thought to be eligible but are not presently participating in the program because of the failure of governmental agencies to advise them of their eligibility. In light of these facts. I urge in the strongest possible terms that you promptly and thoroughly review and reconsider the proposed revision in the regulations and cease attempts to restrict the participation of so many needy persons in the food stamp program. I trust you and other appropriate USDA officials will give this matter your fullest and most careful consideration. I will look forward to hearing from you shortly. Sincerely.",

I am drafting a bill for introduction next week to terminate the monitoring program and once again allow agricultural exports without departmental restriction. I invite all my colleagues to join me in this legislation. Termination of the monitoring program will serve the interests of the American people in two vital ways: First.

Its purpose no one would find fault with: To insure to the extent possible that every working man and woman in the United States is provided safe and healthful working conditions. While on the one hand. it is praised as being the most meaningful piece of labor legislation since the Fair Labor Standards Act. on the other. the law is criticized as being harshly punitive and as giving the Department of Labor the power to put a company out of business. I believe the act is basically in the longterm best interests of the workingman. but threatens to do incalculable harm to business and industry. I am concerned about the hardships which are placed on the small businessman by OSHA in its present form. The law has so bound many businesses as to make it impossible for them to operate at a profit. This could lead to the shutting down of many businesses. higher employment. and lower productionnone of which we need at this time in our country. In my opinion. many of the requirements seem unnecessary for small businesses. I feel changes in OSHA regulations and procedures should be made.

This amendment. basically. is one that will do three things. all of which are needed today.

It is estimated that during the 4year life of this bill. as far as residences in America. new and old. this will effect a savings of at least 250.000 barrels of oil or its equivalent per day. It will cost approximately $700 million If in fact the entire program is accepted by the American people. There is no question but that the conversion aspect is recommended by everyone that has looked at Americas needs. The President. in his state of the Union message. specifically referred to it. The congressional program on economic recovery and energy sufficiency directly recommended this approach. So as to that aspect it is absolutely certain that we must do this in our country. Second. there is no question but that this would stimulate substantial employment. We do not know precisely how much. but certainly it would stimulate the presently depressed construction industry.

We think this amendment would encourage it. and we also have reason to believe. from those who manufacture the apparatus and equipment for solar energy. that it would. in a few short years. bring the cost of solar energy to be used both in residences and In commercial establishments down substantially. It is estimated that if this bill was in place. that kind of applied technology would be reduced in cost for the consumer by about onethird of its present cost. which is basically a demand and supply sort of cost. I will summarize again. because we do not -have much time. Basically. this amendment would apDly to both new and old houses in America. For those that are going to be constructed brand new. we will still allow some incentive if in fact the builder or the owner insists on maximum nsulation standards rather than minimum. Both of these are defined by HUD today. and the difference in cost between the minimum and maximum is that to which the credit and deduction would apply. For old homes. there Is presently a HUD criterion for what Is adequate nsulation. and there again. for those who would want to do this to their homes. that is. install storm windows. insulation. and the like. there will be a crlteron to be followed In terms of their getting adequate insulation Into old homes.

I think. on instances when Senators have occasion to talk to average citizens. they will usually say. \"We would like to insulate our home .and save energy. and If we got a bit of a break we would do it.\" This will permit $1.000 to be spent with tax relief for various expenditures in that field of insulation.",

If we are going to subsidize peopleand this is a worthy endI think we ought to subsidize everyone across the board. and I think it ought to be done after hearings. My colleague from Colorado has a very meritorious bill. which would provide for loans. Perhaps the committee after hearings would include provisions for both loans and direct subsidies.

Senators will want to think about that in connection with how much -overall tax reduction they want to vote. We have added some revenue to the bill. The Hartke amendments. for example. would bring in another $1.60%.000.000 or possibly more if agreed to in conference. I think I should point out that the revenue gains have been offset by the additional tax loss by a lot more than we would pick up. Senators may well want to carefully consider how much they want to load this bill down with amendments that increase it cost. Personally. I think we would be justified in a tax cut bill of about $31 billion. but I am not sure the Senate wants to go that far. If this is added to the bill. I will offer a motion at some point to strike from the bill some portions of that which is already in it. to try to help contain the cost.

In recent months. the Congress has provided for extended periods of coverage by unemployment compensation. In December. we enacted a second 13week extension of the basic unemployment insurance benefits period. bringing regular coverage to a total of 52 weeks. In addition. we enacted a special unemployment compensation program to provide 26 weeks of benefits for those who could not qualify for compensation under the regular UI program. We took these actions. Mr. President. because it was clear that to do otherwise would mean that hundreds of thousands of earnest and able Americans without work would also be without means of support other than the public assistance rolls.

People are frightened. The Government law enforcement agencies are not protecting them. and thus they are acquiring the means to protect themselves. The other fact is that the gun lobby suddenly vanishes when any other proposal to control crime is advanced. such as increased penalties for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. For those who may still believe that the concern of the gun control lobby is crime control. and not disarmament of the victim. I call their attention to the following article by Patrick Buchanan.

Once a union signed up a majority of his employees. a farmer would be forced to bargain with a union agent over wages. hours. and all other conditions of employment. Almost every aspect of the farming operation would be open to negotiation. This could include the number of fields planted. the type of equipment used. and the establishment of quotas in planting and harvesting. The farmer would be at the mercy of labor union officials.

Valuable time and expense have been lost in negotiations over such \"conditions of employment.\" Even basic operational decisions are subjects for mandatory collective bargaining under federal labor law. Although the NLRB and the courts have held that management has the right to decide on its own to shut down an unprofitable plant. they have ruled that the \"effects\" of that decision must be bargained. In one recent case. an NLRB Administrative Law Judge ruled that a company must reopen a plant which had been closed for economic reasons. and must award back pay to all employees idled by the closing. The full NLRB modified that decision. but still required the employer to offer the employees jobs at other plants. and to pay their relocation expenses if they accepted these jobs. Other industrial employers have been charged with unfair labor practices for failIng to bargain over such matters as subcontracting work and changing outmoded work rules. Such rulings seriously restrict a managers right to operate his business efficiently. and jeopardize the jobs of his employees. Mandatory collective bargaining has served to tie industrial management to its current methods of operations. putting stumbling blocks in the path of new technology and more efficient production. It shares a large part of the blame for the declining growth in productivity of American industry. American agriculture. on the other hand. has used its freedom from government interference in farm labormanagement relations to build a record of efficiency and productivity which is the envy of the world. Taking away the farmers basic right to run his own farm by imposing compulsory collective bargaining through federal law would put the foodproducing sector of the nations economy in the hands of labor union officials intent on increasing their own monopoly power at the expense of productivity.

Of particular interest to me was the role which the U.S. Government was playing in the Irish question as well as an investigation of certain practices of the British Govelnment which are in basic violations of the rights of the citizens of Ireland. I was accompanied on this trip by Dr. Fred Burns OBrien. information director of the Irish National Caucus. an organization representing over 1 million Irish Americans and backed by organized labor. Dr. OBrien compiled a report discussing some of the rampant injustices which exist today in the Irish Free State. Many of the current practices of the Irish Government not only fly in the face of what we consider to be justice. but are in direct conflict with provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations. One of the more heinous practices I sought firsthand information about was the practice of Internment. In the North. we find the British Government indiscriminately rounding up individuals. throwing them in prisons with no regard for their legal rights. Many of them are not even charged with crimes. Now in the free state there are nonjury trials resembling administrative rather than judicial practice that infringe on due process as we know it in America. I requested permission from the Irish Government to visit one of the main internment centers. the Portlaoise Prison outside Dublin. I sought information on what charges people were being imprisoned for as well as conditions in the prison. I was denied permission outright. thus increasing my suspicions about the problems of this and other prisons in Northern Ireland. Article 11 of the Declaration of Human Rights states: Everyone charged with a penal offense has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense. Obviously this is not the case in Northern Ireland today. Mr. Speaker. at this point in the RECORD.

The SunTimes series revealed that the black market baby business is most flagrant in interstate and international deals that are out of the control of State authorities and where there is an absence of Federal control. While I doubt we have time to schedule hearings on this legislation before October 2. when Congress is scheduled to adjourn. I hope the introduction of the bill at this time will stimulate interest and after Congress convenes in January. the Judiciary Committee will initiate these hearings. Text of the bill follows: HI.R.A bill to amend title 18 of the United States Code for the purpose of prohibiting the sale of children in Interstate or foreign commerce Be it enacted by the Senate and gouse of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That title 18 of the United States Code is amended by inserting Immediately after chapter 119 the following new chapter: \"Chapter 121.-INTERsTATn PLACEMENT OF",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this week the California State Legislature sent to Gev. Edmund G. Brown. Jr.. a landuse bill that Is of national importance. This legislation. which codifies the key recommendations of the California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission. which was created by a voter initiative passed in 1972. effectively preserves the 1.072milelong California coast for the use and enjoyment of all people. not just those who can afford it. for generation3 to come. The battle for enactment of this legislation involved every conceivable special interest group. Frankly. I doubt that It could have been won if another voter initiative. the Campaign Reform Act passed in 1974. was not already law. I do not need to remind my colleagues of the significance of landuse legislation. We have all had experience with landuse decisions at the local level. and have considered much less significant legislation than the new California law at a Federal level. The controversy that surrounded national landuse planning legislation. which did not even contain landuse controls. was so intensive that the House in the 93d Congress refused to even consider the committeepassed bill. The new California coastline law gives a State commission ultimate power to accept or reject local decisions that may. or may not be in the best interests of all of the people. This type of safeguard has been proven. time and again. to be necessary. Mr. Speaker. and my colleagues in the House. I bring this new law to your attention because I believe it demonstrates that growth can be planned. and valuable national resources can be preserved and protected. even in an area of rapid growth. The Congress will not have time to act on reasonable landuse planning legislation this year. but it should put such legislation high on its agenda for next year. Some additional information on the new California law follows: [From the Los Angeles Times. Aug. 24. 19761 COAST BILL WINS SuRRrsE VICTORY.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am putting into the RECORD at this time an excellent editorial in the August 23 Washington Post. The editorial points out two very important facts of which the 132 cosponsors of the Jobs Creation Act are very conscious. The first fact is that rising business investment per worker is essential to rising productivity. The second fact is that rising productivity is essential if equality of opportunity is to continue to improve. I commend the Washington Post for its editorial leadership on this issue and recommend the editorial to my colleagues. It is a known fact that opportunities expand for everyone when there is a growing economy. As the Washington Post put it: Economic growth makes it possible for the newcomers to move up the ladder without pushing down the people who got there before them. It is also a known fact that workers productivity is not increasing at Its usual rate. because capital investment per worker is not rising at its usual rate. Because of the \"baby boom\" of two decades ago and the unprecedented proportion of women who are now entering the job market. the labor force is growing unusually fast. Therefore. if productivity is to continue to rise. it is imperative that we undertake accelerated steps to increase the rate of capital investment. And that is exactly what the Jobs Creation Act would do. By reducing the tax on work and investment. it would get the train of economic opportunity moving again. Passage of the Jobs Creation Act is the surest way to full employment. stable prices. and growing equality of opportunity for all Americans.",

Recognition that home health care is a viable ri.ative to nursing home care in many cases continues to grow. both in Congress and among professionals and organizations in the health field. Statistics illustrate the need for expanded home health services. Recent HEW figures show that of the 1 million elderly persons in longterm care facilities today. somewhere between 14 and 25 percent of these individuals are there because there are no alternatives available to them. For these people. as well as for the 1 out of 6 older Americans who are not in institutions but who are in need of direct health and social services if they are to be able to remain in their own homes and communities. home health care can be cheaper and psychologically beneficial. As the attached article indicates. individuals who are able to take advantage of home health services can often save money by reducing the length of hospital stays and receiving less expensive. but certainly adequate. care at home. In keeping with my continued interest in seeing home health care legislation enacted. I am placing in the REcoRD today an article from Modem Maturity.

This special service represented the culmination of the efforts of the Sierra Madre Kiwanis Club and support of many loyal and civicminded residents who are concerned about the welfare and security of its citizens. The newly dedicated emergency medical unit will serve to enhance the capabilities and performance of Sierra Madres emergency programa program that has been a pioneer in the field of paramedic services. Initiated in the early thirties. the program has provided invaluable emergency rescue service over the years. In its more than four decades of service to the community. the functions and responsibilities of the emergency medical program have grown enormouslyand. predictably. so has the need for more sophisticated and modern equipment. In April of this year. the Sierra Madre Kiwanis Club decided that the station wagon then being used as an emergency vehicle by the program was inadequate to meet growing needs. After receiving the endorsement of the city fire chief and the sanction of the city council. the club began fundraising efforts to purchase a new emergency vehicle. Responding enthusiastically to the strong leadership of fund drive chairman Sam Tesoro. the community supported the project. and the drive met its goal of $19.000 in just a little more than 10 weeks. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to bring the achievements of the citizens of the lively city of Sierra Madre to the attention of my colleagues and it is my belief that communities all over the country could do well to follow the example of the Sierra Madre Kiwanis Club in raising funds for worthy community needs.

The title \"Representative of the People\" describes the prime directive of his political philosophy. \"Klu\" had more energy than anyone else I knew. For 10 years he was the chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee of our Public Works and Transportation Committee. In that position. he guided the development of our Interstate Highway System. I think that he would have supervised the actual construction on a daytoday basis if he could have. He loved to build. He loved to work. He loved this country. Naming the new Federal building in Chicago in honor of \"Klu\" is a fitting tribute to a great legislator who spent 24 years giving selflessly to the building of this great country. I think that these thoughts are shared by everyone in this Chamber. I hope that you will all join me now in paying a final and lasting tribute to our late friend and colleague.",

Kluczynski Federal Building.\" It would be a fitting tribute to the memory of Johnny Klu. as he was affectionately known by all of us. to have this new Federal building bear his name. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Roads of the House of Representatives Public Works Committee. he was a leading supporter of the Interstate Highway System. and during the quarter century that he served in the House of Representatives. he made a monumental contribution toward the building of Americas highways. And once the Interstate Highway System neared conclusion. Johnny Klu was one of those in the Congress who made it possible to tap the highway trust fund in order to make Federal aid available to hardpressed urban mass transit systems. But most important of all. naming this building for John Kluczynski would be especially appropriate. for as senior member of the Public Works Committee from Illinois. he worked long and hard to establish the Federal complex in Chicagos Loop. It was due to his efforts that the gigantic foursquare block area. containing two modern. uptodate Federal buildings. was delegated for use as a Federal complex. One of these Federal buildings. which is now in use. was named the Everett McKinley Dirksen Federal Building in honor of the memory of Illinois former senior Senator. The other building. which is nearing completion. would be named the John C. Kluczynski Federal Building under the provisions of H.R. 4241 which I was honored to cosponsor. Because of iill the hard work that Congressman Kluczynski put into establishing the Federal complex in Chicagos Loopin fact. the complex has achieved reality largely through his untiring efforts over the yearsit is fitting to give this recognition to Johnny Klu by naming one of the buildings in the Federal complex in his honor. I urge. therefore. that my colleagues support H.R. 4241 which will extend this muchdeserved recognition to the legislative accomplishments and dedicated service of a truly great AmericanJohn C. Kluczynski. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time. was read the third time. and passed. and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.",

The eloquence of the Declaration of Independence shines as bright in 1976 as it did in 1776. The people in my State of Colorado are observing not only our countrys 200th birthday. but also the 100th birthday of our great State. In celebration of these two historical occasions. 56 men and women signed the Redeclaration of Independence in downtown Colorado Springs this week in a gesture of support for the principles that launched our Nation. This gesture. which included the oldest resident of El Paso County. Mary Jane Fisher. 103. and one of the youngest. 13dayold Julie Marie McGinnis. is intended by the Pikes Peak or Bust 76 CentennialBicentennial Committee to prove that citizens of this country and Nation still support the ideals on which this Nation was founded. The committee hopes to get more than 300.000 persons to sign copies of the Declaration of Independence. At the same time they are soliciting 76 cents from each signer to build a vault and monument atop Pikes Peak where the final scroll will be buried for 100 years. The scroll is now at Bicentennial headquarters at 7 North Tejon Street. Colorado Springs. Additional copies of the scroll will be kept on top of the peak throughout the summer so tourists from across the Nation can rededicate themselves to the beliefs that founded our Nation. While the second 56 signers. with names like Lawrence Ochs. Charles Jolliff. James Haney. Gladys Bueler. Nell Evans. and Roy Smith. are 200 years removed from the likes of John Hancock. Thomas Jefferson. and Benjamin Franklin. the spirit of 1776 is still the same. And that makes us proud of the men and women of El Paso County who thought up the idea as a Bicentennial gesture. It makes us equally proud of those who will sign it before it is sealed away for the next century.",

This organization has its origins in Czechoslovakia where it was created during the 1860s to build the physical strength and moral courage of the people. during a time of political struggle for justice and freedom. The first Slovak Sokol organization was formed in my own city of Chicago. on October 30. 1892. Its heritage is similar to that of the American Sokol organization. and Sokol U.S.A. shares the goal of physical and moral strength. The American Sokol organizationCzechand the Sokol U.S.A. organizationSlovakalong with the Catholic Sokols. are known for their excellent physical fitness programs and staunch belief in democracy and freedom. Their contributions to American life are most impressive and significant. Many of the outstanding values and beliefs which they hold are being reaffirmed in celebrations across this country during this. the 200th anniversary of our great Nation. The Sokol movement. which includes men and women of all ages. increases physical fitness while teachingthe virtues of individual responsibility. emphasizing high moral principle. and developing the ability to work successfull with others. Czech and Slovak Americans benefit immeasurably from the varied activities of the Sokol societies. These activities include gymnastic clinics. schools. workshops. meets. and competitions which provide the means to maintain physical strength and stamina while teaching the value of hard work in personal achievement. The Sokol organizations conduct educational activities in the form of lectures and films. They also provide statistics on gymnasts and maintain a library. Other notable activities include the maintenance of camps for youngsters and the awarding of scholarships to worthy members. By emphasizing the conditioning of the body along with the education of the individual. the Sokol organizations are formidable character builders. and contribute greatly to the development of Americas young people who will maintain and perpetuate our Nations precious heritage of freedom and democracy. I congratulate the Sokol membership in the l1th District. which I am privileged to represent. the city of Chicago. and all across the Nation on their enormous contributions to Americas past and I extend my warmest best wishes to them as they continue their diligent efforts to keep our Nation strong and free.",

The speech is responsive to the concerns that many Members of Congress have expressed regarding the need for U.S. foreign policy to be responsive to the human rights dimension of international relations. We have begun to see some small steps toward this end: the State Departments decision not to request military assistance for Chile in fiscal year 1976. the favorable vote of the U.S. delegation to the U.N.

Speed skating is a demanding sport which requires enormous amounts of hard work and dedicationoften with little public acclaim. Because speed skaters do not receive the attention which other sports enjoy. the will to succeed must come primarily from the athletes inner determination to excel. That determination. which Leah Poulos has demonstrated. is the essence of what is best in athletic competition. And the Olympic games are the forum for testing that determination. The Olympics provide no monetary rewards. the athletes who participate are motivated solely by a desire to test their skills against the best athletes in the world.

House Resolution 707 provides for an open rule with 2 hours of debate on H.R. 9005. the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1975. The rule further provides that the bill be read for amendment by title instead of by section. H.R. 9005 is a bill of farreaching vision and represents a significant departure from foreign assistance legislation of the past. It separates the usual feature of joint military and economic authorizations which tended to be used for purely political purposes. It significantly shifts priority to the most pressing problems of the poor majority in poor countries: food and nutrition. health and population planning. education and human resource development. It establishes a special fund to provide for international disaster assistance and authorizes the President to appoint a special coordinator for such purposes. It amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. better known as the Public Law 480 program. so as to provide better and more effective distribution of food aid abroad and to lessen the amount of food aid under title I which may be allocated for solely political purposes. The President is authorized and encouraged to seek agreement on a system of national food reserves. It authorizes loan repayment receipts to support the international fund for agricultural development and enlists the capabilities of U.S. landgrant universities to assist in creating agricultural production in developing countries. The bill authorizes $1.354 billion for fiscal year 1975 and $1.523 billion for fiscal year 1977 for overall assistance. Mr. Speaker. this bill is the kind of foreign assistance which will truly affect progressive economic benefits throughout the world. and I urge the adoption of House Resolution 707 in order that we may discuss. debate and pass H.R. 9005.",

However. according to information made available to the Rules Committee on September 5. the administration objects to certain authorizations contained in the bill for population programs. American schools and hospitals abroad. disaster relief. international organizations and programs. and the authorization for use of foreign aid loan repayments which altogether exceed the Presidents budget requests by $414.000.000. Moreover. the administration does not support the food aid provisions that set a minimum quantity level for title II of Public Law 480. section 208. set a 30percent limit on the amount of Public Law 480 title I sales available to countries not seriously affected by food shortages (section 207). and cancel loan repayments on credit sales if local currency counterpart is used for development purposes (section 205). Notwithstanding all of those objections. the administration supports the bill in general. Appareitly there is hope when this bill gets to the Senate or to conference. some of these things will be deleted. But I am not that optimistic. Mr. Speaker. so I oppose the legislation. as I have done in the past.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am reintroducing today. with a list of welcomed cosponsors. the Civilian Conservation Corps Act of 1975. a bill I submitted earlier this year. The motivations that led to the creation and introduction of this legislation have not dissipated. Unemployment rates still skyrocket at over 20 percent among the Nations youth. and there still remains a great need for additional capital investments in the natural resources of this country. its recreational facilities. its rangelands. its timberlands. and its water resources. Carl Rowan. the Washington Post columnist. questioned six of the Nations top police administrators from six of the Nations top cities. asking them one simple question: \"If you had to recommend one thing. one action the country could take to combat the rise of crime. what would it be?\" All six of these officials agreed that efforts to reduce unemployment in the central cities among young men. especially minority young men under the age of 25 years. would be one of the most effective means of reducing the crime rate. My bill would make. if enacted. great inroads into this area. and I believe offer alternatives to these young menalternatives they do not now have. This bill has been modeled after what many consider to have been one of the best agencies created in the thirties to fight unemployment and the depression. It gives priority in employment of Corps members from areas having a high rate of unemployment for 3 consecutive months. I believe this bill should enjoy the support of rural areas where most of the resources needing work are located. and the support of urban areas where most of those needing employment are located. . I have sent copies of the legislation to every State resource agency. to organized labor. environmental. and industry groups across the country. and have received hundreds of letters of encouragement and support. Not one voice of opposition has been raised. I would welcome further sponsors to this bill. and will reintroduce the bill as required to accommodate such of the Members as may indicate their interest. I have discussed it with the leadership. and the chairman of the concerned committee. and look forward to early hearings.",

At the present time the proceeds from repayments of these loans are returned to the Treasury for later reappropriation by the Congress. Apparently this provision allows at least $200 million in loan reflows. as the report refers to them. to be respent without either authorization or further appropriation by the Congress each year. It would be my contention that this provision violates Public Law 93344. section 401(a). the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. which in effect prohibits the consideration by the House of any bill or resolution which provides any new spending authority.

It is one of the best bills ever to come from our committee: It is the first foreign assistance bill in my memory which came from the committee without a dissenting vote. and without an opposing minority report. . It is a bill which was written in the committee during many long sessions and on a bipartisan basis. which has gained administration support. It is a bill which has received editorial praise in newspapers from Trenton and Minneapolis to Memphis and Houston. It is a bill which has gained strong support from a wide range of civil and religious groups. Why has this measure been so generally approved? Because. I think. this bill is a farsighted attempt to express Americas leadership in helping poor people in poor countries to improve their lives. Further. this bill contains only development assistance. There is not a cent of military aid in the bill. There is not a cent of securitytype aid in the bill. In the past our committee always has opposed splitting economic and military aid into two bills. We believed that a combined bill was the best means of insuring passage. Today times have changed. It is clear that each bill can stand best on its own merits. I know that a number of members on both sides of the aisle who once voted for foreign assistance stopped doing so because of opposition to American policies in Indochina. That era is over. The bill before us is only development assistanceassistance directed at poor people in poor countries.",

I say that because it marshals a very unique resource in this Nation. the landgrant university expertise and the expertise which is found In other similar universities throughout the country. It has been over a century since the original Morrill Act was adopted by this Congress. and during that century our agriculture was transformed from a backward state. lagging behind European countries. to one of unexampled advance and progress. the envy of the entire world. One of the central reasons for this spectacular development over the past century has been the deliberate program of higher education of the small farmers of the Nation. This was brought about first through classroom education funded in part under the Morrill Act. The original Land Grant Act was followed by other acts which made possible the establishment of research stations and then the extension service which brings education on a continuing basis to every county of the Nation. to the farmers and homemakers of every county of the Nation. Inspired by this record. a number of us put together during the past year the proposal which is known as the famine prevention program. and under It the institutions which have had this centurylong experience. this centurylong success story in the continuing education of farmers. will be enabled to help other countries still in the developing stage. hopefully. to establish similar institutions within their own borders which will bring classroom research and extension education to the small farmers of those countries. No one is suggesting that the same system which flourishes here in the United States can be transferred intact to any other part of the world. It will have to be adapted to the educational level. to the needs. and to the ecology of that particular region. but education of farmers is a good investment wherever it occurs. The whole thrust and purpose of this part of the bill which is now before us is to encourage developing countries to take seriously the continuing education of farmers. I would like to express my appreciation to chairman of tha full committee. the gentleman from Pennsylvania . the gentleman from Michigan",

This bill constitutes a major step toward improving this countrys foreign aid program and it is a logical culmination of efforts begun in Congress in 1973. to change the character and focus of what economic assistance we are able to provide to other nations. I believe this bill should be supported because: First. it separates development and security assistance and deals exclusively with economic and food aid programs. Second. it concentrates on basic development dilemmas. in particular food and nutrition aid. Third. the bill gives highest priority to development and food aid for poor people in poor countries. Fourth. the bill contains several provisions which reaffirm. and potentially Increase. the role of private agencies in implementing the economic aid programs. Fifth. the bill provides authorization of a little more than $1.3 billion for fiscal year 1976. a figure which is modest compared to the vast sums we were spending on foreign aid during our long involvement in Indochinasums that we no longer need to expend. and Sixth. the bill provides an important opportunity for Congress to support the oftenstated American commitment to the creation of a more effective and reliable world food system to combat hunger and malnutrition.",

It separates. definitively. military and economic aid. and ensures that no less than 70 percent of the food made available under Public Law 480. the food for peace program. goes to nations most in need of assistance. The bill also adds a new section. entitled \"Famine Prevention and Freedom From Hunger.\" to the Foreign Assistance Act which provides for the establishment of vitally important international food reserves. In addition. It contains provisions for sharing our expertise and agricultural knowhow through the involvement and active cooperation of landgrant colleges with recipient nations. thus enabling them to arrive at better methods of food production and improved utilization of their resources. All these objectives. moreover. were achieved strictly within the congressionally established budgetary framework. Passage of this measure will consequently in no way affect the funding of other high priority programs. The bill authorizes appropriations totalling $1.354.150.000 for fiscal year 1976 and $1.523.850.000 for fiscal year 1977 for such worthwhile programs as agricultural and rural development and nutrition. population planning and health and education and human resource development. Substantial as these sums appear. they actually represent only abcut oneseventh of what Americans spend annually on alcoholic beverages and only about onefourth of what they expend on tobacco and tobacco products. Mr. Chairman. almost 800 million people throughout the world presently suffer from malnutrition. For the poorest of them life expectancy is 30 years less than for those of us who are fortunate enough to live in the United States. Infant mortality rates for their children are four times higher than those that prevail in this country. Fully 85 percent of them have no access to health services. I am very pleased to see that Congress is taking the initiative in assuring that we do our share toward Improving the lot of those less fortunate. and am gratified that the muchneeded economic development and nutrition program are being considered on their own merit and not as adjuncts to expensive. wasteful and often illadvised military aid.

However. the Presidents budget requests for both years have been in excess of the authorized amounts. consequently. the need for the legislation. The final provision of this bill simply grants a 2year extension of the time limit for evaluation of new rules under the MagnusonMoss warranty legislation. As matters stand now. the law requires that by July 5 of this year rules must be evaluated by both the FTC and the administrative conference of the United States. The July 5 deadline simply cannot be met. The FTC has proposed 15 new rules under the MagnusonMoss mandate. but I believe only one of those proposed rules has actually been promulgated. The first promulgation. incidentally. came only last weekon May 14. It is therefore doubtful that the FTC can issue other rules by July 5. When one considers that the administrative conference needs at least 6 months to evaluate the rules. it becomes clear that the July 5 deadline is not an attainable goal. Looking at H.R. 12527 as a whole. one can see that It is a reasonable approach to existing realities at the FTC. The bills reasonable approachand its lack of complexityaccount for the unanimous support given to H.R. 12527 in committee and subcommittee. Mr. Speaker. I urge the approval of this bill.",

I think we should take note that at this moment there is a small group of dissidents. Jews. Catholics. and others. maybe only 9 people in all. who have formed a group in the Soviet Union to do the same thing. We in this country are free. but in that country one of the group. Dr. Yuri Orlov was picked up on the street and questioned for many hours concerning his activity in this regard. Another member of that group. Dr. Vitaly Rubin. a distinguished sinologist. is also in the group. They and we are hoping that these international accords will be more than just another empty piece of paper. Here today we have a chance to take a first step in the direction of true compliance. Mr. Speaker. in enacting this legislation I think we would be speaking to those principles that have distinguished this country for many years. There is nothing new about American concern for other people. When I was a child there was a terrible flood in the Yellow. or Yangtze River in China. and many small churches in Ohio and in New Jersey and in Colorado sent aid to the Chinese. This is the kind of Nation we have always been. Respect for the dignity of the individual has been one of our principles. and the rights of the individual. and the right of dissident as proclaimed so eloquently by Thomas Jefferson in his inaugural address. Mr. Speaker. this kind of concern is native to America. This ought to be the basis of our international relations. These ought to be the things of which we speak to the world: a concern for our fellow human beings. knowing that we are all one family. regardless of distance and dissent or any other kind of barrier. concern for their right to freedom of religion. for their right to travel and be unified with their families. This is what this bill is all about.",

These nations will come together again in June 1977. in Belgrade. This Commission that is formed today by Congress. the bill having already passed the Senate. will bring to all those nations information on a regular basis about compliance or noncompliance with the commitments made at Helsinki. At the Brussels Conference on Soviet Jewry in February 1976. the greatest hope cherished by the 1.200 delegates was the Helsinki agreement. everyone at Brussels looked to the monitoring by the United States. particularly. and by other nations of what the 35 nations agreed to at Helsinki. The problems are very broad. freedom of travel. free cultural exchanges. working conditions of journalists and unification of families. I am happy to note that the Holy See was one of the signatories among the 35 nations. Lawyers from the Holy See were very active for 2 years at the committee meetings held in Geneva preparatory to the Helsinki Declaration of August 1.

In my own State of Texas. we have a highly innovative program now in operation at the DallasFt. Worth Airport. I refer to the automated guideway transit project known popularly as AirTrans. This system. as the chairman knows. runs on a fixed rail. has operating costs generally lower than that of rail and bus transit operations. It is easier to construct and less expensive and less disruptive than major subway systems. It has successfully traveled over 5 million miles. carrying over 4.8 million revenue passengers. It is completely automated. I have become convinced that the AirTrans system deserves wider applicability. I believe it could be adapted successfully to downtown urban use as a feasible transit alternative which would provide greater flexibility in urban transit. In my view. a researchand demonstration project involving AirTrans would have great value nationwide. Is it the view of the chairman that the funds under UMTA research and development could be used to support a demonstration program to determine AirTrans capability in urban areas?",

Section 14(b) of the TaftHartley Act provides that States may. in their jurisdiction. pass righttowork laws. Many States have done this. Efforts have been made from time to time to repeal section 14(b). doing away with the rights and powers of the States to enact legislation in this field. But those efforts have never been successful because Congress has recognized the right of States to legislate in this field. The Congress can pass legislation taking that power away from the States. Conversely. they can pass legislation that becomes the general law of the land but allow the States. in their discretion. to go a different route. This is exactly the same situation. It Is a most important departurethat is. the pending legislation. the situs picketing concept. is a departurefrom the existing law. But the Congress has the perfect right. as it has done in the case of righttowork laws. to authorize the States to put in laws that the State legislatures feel their people want. That is all It does. Until such time as the States act. common situs picketing would be permitted throughout the length and breadth of the land. But if the legislature of the State of New Jersey. North Carolina. Louisiana. California. or Alabama want to outlaw it or make it illegal. if they want to continue the present law of the land. they would have the right to do so by affirmative action.

In reference to the statement that was made earlier that if we do not allow this deficit to occur. it means that that amount of money will not be spent. That is not the case at all. That is not true. The Federal Government is not the only spender of money. Every $10 billion of deficit that takes place. as the Senator from Wisconsin. Senator PROXMIRE. said. represents 500.000 housing starts that will not get started. 1 million primary jobs. and 2 million secondary and tertiary jobs. not to mention the money that is being siphoned off in the marketplace. and thus preventing recovery. For every $10 billion of national deficit that has to be financed. we are talking about an inflation rate of about 1.5 percent. If one looks at all of the factors concerning the deficit over the last 20 years one can see a direct correlation between the amount of that deficit and the rate of inflation in our country.

I think that the proposal which he is making for approximately $11.3 billion is certainly deserving of the careful consideration of the House of Representatives. With great respect for the majority of the House Committee on Budget Control which has brought In the report which is under consideration in the House today. it occurs to me that instead of taking the necessary actions to correct some of the ills which beset our economy. that this budget. if adopted as the product of the House. it is my opinion. Mr. Chairman. that unless the amendment which is proposed to be offered by my colleague from Georgia is adopted. that this will have the effect of returning to a double and. in a few isolated instances. triple digit inflation which we have recently experienced. I know that everybody has his own idea of the causes of both inflation and of economic recession. but I still belong to the school of thought that believes that the prime cause of the inflation which straddles our economy is and has been the continually increasing and apparently uncontrolled deficit spending by the Federal Government of the United States. Unless and until we in the Congress undertake to restore some semblance of sanity to the operation of the Budget of the United States. then I foresee a continued weakening of the economy. We hear a great deal everywhere we turn today about the apparent loss of confidence in the United States by the governments of other countries in the world. It occurs to me. Mr. Chairman. that the remarks made by my colleague from Georgia would point directly to the fact that one reason for this loss of confidence by our friends and foes throughout the world. has been the manifestation that the Congress and the Government of the United States are no longer capable of putting our fiscal house in order. Mr. Chairman. I congratulate my colleagues on his very learned exposition of his views on this subject. I wish to associate myself with them.

I advocated a process of this sort long before I knew that the Congress had adopted one. because I felt that it was unthinkable that the Congress of the United States could have gone for so many years. spending money and piling up deficits throughout the year. without having any idea how much was being spent and how large the deficit was going to be. For that reason I commend those who have participated in thi progress. OXXI785--Part 10 Yet I have heard some things here today that really surprise me. I have heard speaker after speaker stand and say we must adopt a budget resolution regardless of whether it is a good one or a bad one. It makes absolutely no sense to meindeed. I consider it an abandonment of the most minimum legislative responsibilityto vote for any resolution simply because it is there. It would be far better for us to reject bad legislation so that we will have an opportunity to vote for good legislation. Under the rules established by the Budget Act. a motion to recommit is not permitted. but I certainly believe that if this House were to reject this resolution. if that unfortunately becomes necessary. the budget committee will understand what the message of this Congress is and bring back a budget resolution that Is acceptable.",

In fact. the next comment I was going to make was to urge that this House. in the course of the vote tomorrow. or whenever it comes. to reach a consensusto make a decision. but I deplore the suggestion that we would simply adopt a resolution because it is there. Mr. Chairman. I have two remaining points. There will be amendments to this bill offered under the pretext of removing \"caps\" from certain programs. I would like to point out as emphatically as I can that there is no amendment that can be offered to this resolution that can remove a \"cap\" from any program. The law forbids any such amendment. We can only change gross amounts and figures. We cannot legislate about specific programs. We can keep a $73 billion limitation on a deficit and still permit the \"caps\" to be removed. because that is a matter that addresses itself to the various committees in the Congress. It simply would require us in the Congress to have enough intestinal fortitude to make cuts in other programs in order to permit these \"caps\" to be removed. but I think we should not vote for an Increase in the size of this budget deficit on the false and misleading pretext that it. in itself. will lead. to a removal of the \"caps\" on social security and other programs. That simply is not true. Finally. one last observation: We hear a lot that we cannot make cuts in this budget because there are uncontrollable expenditures and that there is only a small amount of the budget that is controllable. I suggest to the Members that every part of this budget is controllable if Congress simply had the courage to go back and write the laws in a way which will give us the opportunity to vote annually on whether the appropriation for any program should be made or not. That would place Congress back in control of the budget and bring us fiscal responsibility. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the remainder of my time.",

The reason for that type of approach in this budget is that we have tried to go with programs that would produce immediate outlays and be an immediate stimulus to the economy. We would then move back out of that kind of outlay so that we would not have a stimulus when the economy returns to full action. The gentleman is absolutely correct. If we wish to take the figures and apply the usual outlay to budget authority relationships. then our outlay figures would drop by a considerable amount. I can mention just one program. for example. the accelerated public works program. This projects $3 billion outlays on $5 billion in budget authority in the next fiscal year. As the gentleman knows. the standard outlay figure in public works is usually about onethird. and that would be high. So the gentleman is absolutely correct. I thank the gentleman for his comment.",

It is a larger deficit than I like. It is $24 billion larger because of the adoption of the tax rebate that I opposed. It does not set priorities exactly as I would have them set. but I think those comments can be made as we deal with specific amendments later on. The point about this resolution is that it is necessary if the Congress is to establish ceilings and to fulfill its obligation to exercise the control of the purse strings which is required by the Constitution of the United States and by the voice of the people we represent. This resolution is not an easy resolution to support. Perhaps that is a reason for supporting it. It makes us shoulder for the first time the responsibility of considering at the same time this Nations revenues and expenditures. It is an honest resolution. It does not exaggerate figures or engage in selfdeception. Our financial house today is in disarray. but that is no reason for abdicating our responsibility to gain control of our Nations purse strings.

Mr. Chairman. when I spoke earlier in this session to interrogate the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. who has labored earnestly and hard to perform these very difficult labors. I did not make my own position clear. As a member of the Budget Committee. I have been distressed in this first year in which we are trying to determine the relationship between income and outgo in some orderly fashion. to find that the relationship is a very distant relationship indeed. As a matter of fact. up in western New York. we would not even call income and outgo shirttail relations if they are as far apart as they are here judging from the first report brought out by the Budget Committee. Our failures of consanguinity. we can correct by affinity. I would like to see this report sent back to the Budget Committee by a resounding rejection on the floor of the House. The Budget Committee could then perform some sort of shotgun marriage and bring these two into a much closer relationship than they apparently have. judging from the figures that are before us. I think this whole process will be viewed as incredible by the American people If we advocate a deficit of the dimension of $73.2 billion by our support and recommendation here on the floor of the House. This process is too important to let its credibility be damaged in that way. I realize that our procedures do not permit a recommittal. but it appears it is within the power of the Budget Committee further to deliberate and further to recommend. particularly in this year in which we have a dry run. socalled. And so I hope. Mr. Chairman. that we will reject a deficit of this dimension and give the Budget Committee by that fact not the coup de grace but instead a mandate to go back and try to bring a closer relationship out of the two basic elements of our fiscal policy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am introducing a bill today that would create a Division of Consumer Affairs within the Security and Exchange Commission--SEC. This Division would be charged with responding to requests for information and complaints received by the SEC. When the SEC receives a complaint about a stock brokerage firm today. it forwards it to the firm in question with a request for its comments. Not surprisingly. the firm normally responds that the complaint is without foundation. The SEC then forwards this response to the complaining party with a form letter stating that the Commission is not authorized to act on behalf of investors. and suggesting the retention of private counsel. In many cases. the amount in controversy is so small that retaining private counsel is not economically feasible. and the complaints of the small investor fall through the cracks unresolved. This SEC system clearly needs to be improved so that the small investor may receive the protection and benefits which the Commission was created to provide. A response to a complaint should extend. whenever possible and appropriate. beyond a simple referral of the complaint to the firm against whom the complaint was made. In many cases a visible SEC investigation would be far more productive than an inhouse check by the firm involved. In addition. the Division would serve as a consumer advocate within the SEC. advising the Commission with respect to the effect on small investors of proposed action by the Commissionor any registered exchange or associationand making recommendations for other action. Finally. the Division would have the authority to assist persons who are or may become parties in civil litigation if. due to the size of any potential recovery or potential legal fees. retention of private counsel would be economically infeasible and SEC assistance would be in the public interest. Mr. Speaker. I hope that this bill will provide a forum for much needed discussion in the area of consumers and their relation to Federal agencies.

This proposal will extend the existing deadline by 2 years thereby allowing those veterans who are in school to finish or at least prepare their alternatives. It must be recognized that each armed conflict of our history represents a unique phase of our political. social. and economic cycles. The Vietnam veteran. unlike the veteran of past decades. was discharged into a society of unemployment. recession. spiralling inflation. and an everincreasing demand for advanced educational degrees.

I believe 10 years would be enough time for a student to complete a college degree. however. a veterans readjustment from years of military service does not always denote normal circumstances. Problems. both economic and social. can make coming home a difficult experience. Being a veteran myself and knowing the sacrifices which are made in any war.

In the garment industry. many American companies now cut their material in this country. then ship the material abroad to be sewn and finished by foreign labor for importation back into this country. Why do these manufacturers send their work abroad? In the first place. they can avoid American laws and union contracts on wages and working conditions. In fact. many garments now brought into this country under this system are produced under sweatshop conditions reminiscent of the early days of the industrial revolution.

While we are celebrating. though. we are also questioning. We are engaging in national selfanalysis. the results of which could well determine the course of action for the United States In the next 200 years. Some people have lost faith and hope. some have allowed their disillusionment with temporary situations to dissipate their underlying faith in a form of government that has endured for two centuries. Fortunately. however. most Americans still take great pride in their country and have great hope for the future. With this hope and effort our liberties will continue. To that end.

In other words. at the present time. every other person between the ages of 18 and 60 has to register for work if he gets food stamps and he has to meet the requirements of accepting the employment. Many. many students work full time and go to school. Capitol Hill is filled with them. Why should we say to the students. \"You are the only ones who dont have to work in order to get food stamps\"? The committee bill does not even require them to register for work in the summertime to qualify for food stamps. The saving is not so great. but there is an important principle involved. We are taxing the people who cannot go to college and do not go to college to provide food stamps for 5 or 10 years to anybody that elects to go to school. They do not even have to register to work in the summertime. I think that is wrong. This amendment would require college students to meet work registration requirements. as well as job search and acceptance if offered. instead of automatically disqualifying college students. Many of the arguments cited re amendment No. 1533 apply here as well. There is no reason why college students should be exempt from work registration and related requirements applicable to other recipients. It is entirely possible that a college student may be offered a job which would be consistent with his college schedule. there is no reason why. moreover. he should not be able to. and required to. adjust his curriculum schedule if an opportunity to work arises. Innumerable students in the past have put themselves through college by working. The food stamp program now offers. instead. what amounts to a free ride at taxpayers expense for some students. It should be noted that this. as well as the previous amendment. have a carefully drafted provision that does not disqualify the familythe parents and brothers and sisters. for examplewhich was previously eligible for food stamps if a son or daughter goes to college.

Clearly. a student who accepts a fulltime job is no longer a student and thus the amendment simply uses a different mechanism to disqualify students. The Senator from Nebraska. as I understand it. may offer my amendment No. 1535. which I can support. It requires college students to register for work during vacation periods of 30 days or more. I think this is a step in the right direction. But I think the amendment just offered by the Senator from Nebraska. is an amendment that somehow disqualifies poor students. As the Senator from Georgia pointed out in debating the last amendment. the committee bill has been tightened up. Anybody who could be claimed as a tax dependent is ineligible for food stamp benefits. Therefore. I am opposed to the present amendment of the Senator from Nebraska.",

In other words. if someone had income of $225. and was over 65. only $200 of it would be counted. Thus it was in their favor. When the committee accepted that idea. they lowered the age from 65 to 60. I think we should keep this age in conformity with most of the social security program. Unless one is disabled or there is some other special reason. or he accepts a reduced amount. the standard retirement age is 65. I believe that we make a mistake when we do not have as much uniformity throughout the Government as possible. Other special benefits for the aging. such as the double exemption on the individual income tax. take effect at 65. There was no sound reason offered in the committee for lowering it to 60.

If someone becomes unemployed at 60 years of age. job offers which would give that person an opportunity for employment are almost nonexistent. unless he has some particular skill or is a professional person. That is the reason why the committee felt we would allow this additional $25 for those who are 60 years of age or over. We have taken care of this problem of people with high incomes getting food stamps by eliminating all this vast maze of deductions. That is the reason why we used to see some of these advertisements in Parade magazine: \"Send me $3.50. and I will tell you how to get on food stamps. even though your family earns $16.000 a year.\" I am sad to tell you that could be true. If you could pyramid those deductions. This committee bill has tried to eliminate that by putting a cap on all deductions that they can take. That cap is $100 a month for the ordinary individual. but for one who is 60 years of age or over it is another $25. making it $1.500 a year. That is the cap that we put on this deduction from income. to keep people from affluent families from drawing food stamps. Mr. President. I hope the amendment will be rejected.",

There is a long list of loopholes. such as those for students who do not have to meet the requirements that other people have to meet. This is what the amendment would do: This takes the AFDC criteria established by the distinguished Senator from Georgia and applies them to food stamps. In the program of AFDC. the parent is not required to register for work if he or she is caring for a child 6 years of age or under. That was a loophole that was closed by the Committee on Finance with the Talmadge amendment. It is sound and workable. This bill exempts people from working if they have a child under 12. and there are other provisions to take care of the handicapped. and so forth. A child from 6 to 12 is in school. and for the AFDC program we require the parent to register in order to get benefits. Here. the committee chose to put it at 12 years instead of 6.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I oppose the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. The current food stamp program exempts from the work registration requirement any adult who is responsible for the care of a child under age 18. The Agriculture Committee lowered the age of such dependent child to 12. Amendment No. 1538. as proposed by Senator CURTIS would lower this age limit even further and require the parent of a child over age 6 to register for. and accept. employment as a condition for receiving food stamps. This amendment would mean that a parent with children aged 7. 9. and 11. would have to leave home. search for work. and accept a jobpossibly on a night shift. The committee considered such a requirement. but rejected it on the grounds that children aged 6 to 11 are too young to have their mothers forced out of the home. The Curtis amendment would also be extremely costineffective. It would require food stamp offices to locate child care slots for tens of thousands of women. Already. a huge number of welfare mothers are considered \"unavailable for employment\" because welfare offices can find no afterschool or evening child care for their children. The Curtis amendment would make this situation far worse. It would entail the expenditure of millions of dollars in attempts to find and provide social services such as child care. and in the end. most of these women would have to be considered \"unavailable\" anyway. Moreover. many of the daycare facilities currently available to lowincome families. are overcrowded. ill equipped. and understaffed. The additional demand created by this amendment would compound the present problems. and further lessen the already minimally beneficial aspects of the centers. It is reasonable to allow a parent the opportunity of assuming the childrearing role at least until the child is 12 years old. especially when the alternative is too often inadequate \"caretaker\" day care. The committee bills use of age 12 is a reasonable compromise in this area. and balances the needs of a young child against the goal of forcing people to look for and accept employment. I suggest that this amendment simply would add millions of dollars to the program. It is cost ineffective. For that reason. the amendment should be defeated.",

The final result of the committee bill was an effort to compromise the differences. and I might suggest that at the appropriate time there will be a substitute bill offered by the Senator from Kansas which will lower the purchase requirement to 25 percent in an effort to make certain that those truly in need can participate in the program. As a tradeoff for lowering that contribution. we will drop any effort to eliminate the purchase requirement. But. as the Senator from Kansas said many times. reform is a twoedged sword. We want to lop off those people who should not be in the program and the committee. under the leadership of the Senator from Georgia. has done this. but at the same time we want to make certain that those who should participate and have not been able to participate can participate.

I would hope it would -\"tisfy almost anybody who is opposed to changing congressional salaries. What it says is that the Members of the House do not get the 5percent adjustment. but the Members of the Senate get it. We are going to be getting $3.000 less than our brothers on the other side of the Capitol. It also says that Federal judges will get a 5percent increase. We are then going to be making less than district court judges. maybe about as much as Federal referees in bankruptcy. and the Assistant Secretary of Labor or Interior is going to be making more than a chairman of a great House committee. Mr. Speaker. I am going to vote for the Shipley amendment because I realize the realities of the public mood. Some of the Members may go beyond that and try to roll our salaries back or diminish them. thereby putting ourselves down. However.

As far as I know. this is the first time in history and certainly the first time in recent history that this bill has been handled under a closed rule. The use of a closed rule for this kind of bill simply reinforces the lack of confidence that people have in the Congress as an institution. The closed rule gives testimony to weak leadership and lack of selfconfidence by the majority group. We on the Republican side intended to offer a reform package of eight amendments. all of which have been put Into the RECORD. Many of these amendments are intended to make changes to prevent the reoccurence of alleged abuses brought to light in the HaysRay incident. For some reason the majority and its leadership does not want to discuss those issues nor to attempt to correct apparent deficiencies. The whole process. including the presentation of the closed rule. smacks of a coverup and gives the people the worst possible picture of Congress. The only way to open up our procedures to responsible debate. amendment and sunlight is to defeat the closed rule today. I wonder. Mr. Speaker. what the Members who vote for this rule will tell their constituents. Will they tell the folks who sent them hereto the peoples Housethat the peoples elected representatives are not capable of making decisions about their own accountability? Will they tell their constituents the Democratic leadership is saving us from our own weaknesses? I am not going to tell my constituents that I have willingly given up my right and theirs. to debate and amend the most important issue of congressional accountability. I am not going to hide behind a gag rule. Let those who do know it is done at their own peril.",

To appropriate and spend $780 million of their money on congressional activities without open debate on all issues is a violation of the spirit of responsible and open government. This proposed rule shows that open government receives much more support with words than votes. The impact of King Caucus on decisions of the Rules Committee was very apparent when my request to them to make an amendment in order providing for open public access to all congressional employment records at all times was rejected along with many others. The text of my amendment was: The expenditure of any appropriation under this Act. available for disbursement by the Clerk of the House of Representatives. shall be limited to those expenditures where all records and documents pertaining thereto are available for public inspection during normal working hours each day. excepting only Sundays. Saturdays. and legal holidays. Rejection of this amendment clearly illustrates the continuing double standard practiced by the majority party. that is. that of demanding that the executive branch of Government be totally open and forthcoming. while refusing to require the same standard for its own activities.

Thus State production trends followed national patterns thus reflecting the national market for coal and fluctuations are not due to changes in State law.

Now. on the 25th anniversary of the Guam Organic Act. which provided for the establishment of a territorial civil government and conferred American citizenship on the people of Guam. it is proper that Guams progress and experience in home rule be strengthened by the granting of additional local autonomy.

Indeed. it is hard to believe how far we have come in so short a span of mans history. We are. a healthier people enjoying significantly longer lives than did our early American ancestors. With equal cogency. Dr. Knowles discusses the problems which have accompanied the progress. The expanding utilization of complex medical technology. for instance. has been accompanied by a decline in the personal doctor/patient relationship. And the cost of medical care has escalated so high that many Americans cannot afford to participate in preventive health care. Serious disease can spell financial as well as personal disaster to most American families. And. in the land of plenty. nearly 25 million poor people stand in dire nutritional and medical need. The list of problems goes on. I was interested in some of the figures cited by Dr. Knowles. He mentions that in 1904. we had in this country 160 medical schools. Today we have only 114. In spite of the qualitative improvements of these schools. the decline in number is not encouraging. I noted also the increasing percentage of foreign medical school graduates practicing in the United States--since 1959 their number has quintupled. Obviously we need to be doing a better job of opening medical educational opportunities to our own youth. with the kind of incentives that will provide the maximal distribution of doctors and health care throughout all regions of the country. Mr. President. I commend this essay to the attention of my colleagues. I hope they will take a few minutes to read it over. and for that purpose. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed",

It is also true to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To date. we have been joined by 30 cosponsors. The fact that some U.S. companies have apparently bowed to economic pressures saddens me. Our resolution will stiffen the resolve of U.S. companies to resist such demands. strengthen the Presidents hand in opposing such practices. and hopefully. encourage other countries to take similar stands. The U.S. Government should examine its relationships with countries that practice such discrimination. and we should justify the continuation of foreign aid. sales of defense material. or other assistance programs for the benefit of any country that persists in practicing such discrimination. We believe this is a timely and necessary bill. We have written Chairman MAGNUSON of the Commerce Committee. uring him to take action on this important legislation.

This bill is responsive legislation dealing with the real problem of livestock producers who go unpaid for their efforts. in the event of a packer bankruptcy. It also returns the transaction of selling livestock to a \"cash basis\" through the bills prompt payment provisionpatterned after existing Kansas law. In recent years the time between delivery of livestock and actual receipt of payment had been lengthened through changes in marketing. One provision of the bill as agreed to by the conferees. I feel deserves particular attention. The conferees agreed to an expanded packer definition to include any person engaged in the business of marketing meats. meat food products. or livestock products in an unmanufactured form acting as a wholesale broker. dealer or distributor in commerce. Through this provision the producers are assured these individuals will conduct their meat operations in a fair. competitive manner in competition with slaughterers. meat processors and other persons selling meat at wholesale. I am always hesitant to allow the Federal Government to enter into a new program of overregulation. I was particularly reluctant to grant the Secretary of Agriculture authority to require reports of all wholesalers as a matter of course without justification. I am pleased the conference report language clearly states that the conferees intend that the Secretary will engage in regulation only when it is shown to be necessary. This would include reporting requirements. With this clarification. the expanded definition should not place any additional burden of the reliable wholesaler.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. many of our young men have served our Nation in battle. Many returned to our shores aged by the ravages of war. others bear physical scars of battle. These disabled American veterans have earned our gratitude and support. I have recently learned of a problem they face that may seem small to us but it is very important to the disabled veteran. As we all know. our recuperating veterans have assembled paper poppies while they recover in Veterans Administration Hospitals across America. Since 1922. these bright red poppies have become a traditional part of the Memorial Day remembrances for those veterans who never came home and for those who served so well. The donations received for these poppies have helped many disabled veterans and their families. The therapeutic benefits of the poppy fabrication by hospitalized veterans also should not be overlooked. Unhappily. the poppy programs continued existence is now threatened by regulatory and legal problems. Recently. the Civil Service Commission indicated that the minimum wage requirements and the administrative burdens of the Fair Labor Standards Act may be applied to the poppy program. The Veterans Administration fears that patients lawsuits may subject it to civil and criminal penalties. Due to their marginal budget. payment of minimum wages and court penalties could end the poppy program. I feel this would be detrimental to the health and welfare of our disabled veterans. I must stress that participation in the program by the disabled veteran is entirely voluntary. This unique and innovative program enables these volunteer veterans to help their comrades and themselves. This effort conflicts with no private business and seems incapable of harm to anyone. The poppy program should be encouraged as one of the great American volunteer programs that provide the forum for American citizens to help one another. Let us work to keep the poppy program alive by exempting it from the regulations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. I am pleased to join Senator GRIFFIN a a cosponsor of amendment No. 2121 to e Veterans Administration Exchange of Information Act. S. 3348. which would effect this worthwhile exemption. HABITAT",

Firemen have strong views about what is needed to provide adequate fire protection. and what they in particular need and deserve to carry out their end of the fire safety effort. Recently. I sent a questionnaire to firemen in my district to see how they felt not only about their own needs. but about fire regulations and fire services administration in general. I think their opinions are well worth our attention. FUNDING Indiana firemen unanimously agreed on the questionnaire that fire services ard not adequately funded. Almost all agreed this affects their salaries. Michael Knack. Jr.. of Valparaiso wrote. \"From talking to the general public. 90 percent agree that firefighters are underpaid. Why do the politicians ignore this fact?\" Many firefighters also expressed strong concern about their recently endangered pensions. and legal restrictions which have hurt their growth. Paul Holladay of West Lafayette wrote. \"firefighters worked for and deserve that which they thought they would receive upon retiring.\" Over 75 percent of the respondents also said they worry about insufficient injury compensation. Firefighters believe the lack of funding also harms fire safety programs in general. About 75 percent of the respondents said public education about fire and fire research suffer. and almost half said the same was true of training and equipment. Not quite twothirds of the firemen felt insufficient funding leads to deficiencies in firefighters protective clothing.",

Zambia came before the United Nations Security Council to call for action against South Africa for her invasion of Zambian territory and the killing of Namibian and Zambian people on July 11. 1976. Mr. Speaker. I am sure that my colleagues are well aware of the outcome of that particular Security Council meeting. On July 30. the Security Council passed a resolution condemning the South African attack on Zambia with a vote of 14 in favor of the resolution and one abstentionthe United States. Needless to say. our abstention further gives the United States an appearance in the eyes of black Africa of supporting the white minorityruled government in South Africa. Silence. in most instances. can be taken for agreement of actions or of events in question. I believe that we cannot afford to jeopardize our relationship with the vast majority of Africa for a racist few. South Africa seeks to continue its white minority domination. The injustices that exist and are perpetuated by this white minority rule should not be allowed to continue.

He also went into the details of the stainless steel industry by saying it constituted only 1 percent of steel used in the stainless steel industry. However. in normal highcarbon steel production. it takes around 6.000 men working in the mills to produce 1 million tons of steel. It takes an average of six men behind every worker in the steel mill to produce that. Therefore. it amounts to 6 times 6. or 36.000 workers for every ton of steel in the highcarbon steel industry. but in the stainless and metallurgical the average is 22.000 men for every 1 million tons of steel times 6. so we then get 132.000 workers who have lost their jobs in this industry even though they account for only 1 percent of the total production of steel. The total flatware stainless steel industry in these United States is practically unable to meet the production needs of this country. There is no way in the world that we can produce at this moment any amount of stainless steel and metallurgical steel in order to keep the proper balance let alone to exist. unless we admit the fact that our trade policies are the seat of our entire unemployment problem.

This brings the total to nearly 60.000. Each one of those workers was in endproduct production. Taking 5 times that. we have approximately 300.000 workers in the United States. presumed to be similarly affected. By the way. every one of those workers jobs were affected because of the Canadian auto pact. Mr. Chairman. are we going to continue to close our eyes and pay out billions of dollars for job training for jobs that are nonexistent and will not be in existence? Unemployment compensation funds were not designed for permanent unemployment. It was a temporary measure for unemployment caused by seasonal changes. by temporary jobs. and for reasons of changes in style. That is all the Unemployment Compensation Act was created for.

He may have given the rest of the worldand our adversaries in particularhard evidence that the United States is not the paper tiger some have made it out to be in the wake of the Vietnam defeat.

He was a Brigadier General when he retired from the Army Reserve in 1948. I remember with pleasure my service with Ken Keating in the Senate.

I remember well that in the summer of 1962. in a speech on this floor. he warned of the entry of Soviet missiles into Cuba. and that fall the Cuban missile crisis was announced by President Kennedy.

It is unfortunate that the term \"energy crisis\" has become associated with oil embargoes and long lines at gasoline pumps. In fact. the energy crisis came into being before those two specific symptoms became evident. The energy crisis has not disappeared. It has deepened. Our options have been reduced. and the cost of solutions has increased. The hope for painless solutions is extremely dim. In our search for answers to the problems we face. it is necessary to understand the importance of politics. Almost all of our present energy problems--if not all--can be traced back to irrational. shortsighted. politically motivated decisions by the Congress and past administrations. In truth. the energy crisis was born during the 1960s. and came to the recognizable stage by the end of that decade. To attempt solutions without understanding the basics for our present predicament would be unproductive. A recent speech. given by Mr. William R. Chandler before the Oil Heat Institute in Boise.

I must say that I think he fails to recognize what is the actual. pragmatic situation here. In discussing this legislation. I have talked with quite a number of local union leaders. They are very anxious to have this particular provision. They are anxious to have it because they recognize the whipsawing that has gone on between the various building trade unions in particular areas. where one got an increase of. say. 15 percent. and that meant. automatically. that the individual who is a head of another union. when the contract expires shortly thereafter. was faced with having to match. that 15 percent. regardless of the economics of that situation. because of pressures that really came from within his own union under those circumstances. The reason. I think. that those who are enlightened in the local unions. the local union leadership and the members as well. welcome this veto powerreally. that is all it is. The contract negotiations still initiate at whatever level they have been initiating at in the pastif they initiate at the local level or. if it is on a broader scale. at that particular level. and the terms are worked out at that level. It does represent. I think. a way in which the international unions. working with the local unions. can establish a degree of responsibility about the increases and the changes that are worked out in particular contracts. The reason it is welcome is that there has been some experience in this regard in the building trades operations under wage and price controls through the 197174 period. If the Senator will look at the percentages of increases that occurred during the years prior to that in the building trades as compared to how they leveled out and became far more stable. and. I think. a satisfactory pattern in labor and management alike. I think he will understand why the amendment is not well advised.",

I have discussed with general contractors in Alaska the effect of the passage of S. 1479 I have assured them that the passage of this bill would in no way change the present law concerning the legitimacy of a strike or a picket line at a construction site for any of the following reasons: First. to protest the delivery to the construction site of materials supplied by a nonunion supplier. Second. to coerce a general contractor to cease doing business with an offsite supplier because the offsite supplier is nonunion. or Third. to encourage the unionization of an offsite nonunion supplier.

I think that today Congress makes a very important statement. It makes a necessary statement of principle about how we intend our handicapped children to be treated in the educational process. Unfortunately we cannot by that or any other statement. change the attitudes of those who would equate \"handicap\" with \"inferior.\" Attitudes and prejudices cannot be legislated away. They will only be changed by the good will of men. This statement that we make will help because it is designed to bring our children together. those with and without handicaps to try to undo the prejudice in education. If we can do that much. Mr. President. we will have begun in large measure to relieve the next generation of the problems posed by the education of the handicapped child. This thing that we do. then. is not only an act of law for equality in education. but an act of love for those extraordinary children wishing only to live ordinary lives. Finally.

I would like to express my support for House Resolution 1476. 1477 and 1522. Identical resolutions which I cosponsored. and which were introduced by my colleague from New Jersey. Mr. PATTEN. As I am sure you are aware. these resolutions express the sense of the Congress with respect to minority groups within Romania. Because the end of the session is almost upon us. I believe that no decisive action will be taken on these resolutions by the House and that Romania will probably be granted an extension of its MFN status. However. for the sake of the record. it. must be pointed out that onerous policies of the Romanian Government toward its citizens still exist and mar the relationship between our two countries. The Romanian Government continues to severely restrict the basic human and civil rights of Its citizens. They must. for example. report the content. time and place of any conversation with a foreigner to the militia. or fear criminal prosecution. Artistic freedom Is absent as is religious freedom. The JacksonVanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 addressed the question of free emigration as a major requirement for MFN status. However. while certain statistics might try to show an enlightened emigration policy. there is evidence that the Romanian Governments adherence to this policy is ephemeral. relaxing only when it is time for the Congress to reexamine Romanias trade status. Another vital. but often neglected part needed to be examined in the granting of mostfavorednation status. is consideration of the treatment of national minorities. In Romania there are 2.5 million Hungarians and about 500.000 Germans who reside in the historical province of Transylvaniawhich was transferred to Romania in 1920.

The exact figure94 percentis a disappointingly high figure. and one that harshly underscores the need for the United States to do everything we can to discourage our companies from going along with the Arab attempt to isolate Israel economically from the rest of the world. Requests to comply with the Arab boycott were received. in the 6 months ending March 31. 1976. in 11.482 transactions. The companies which received these requests and later reported them to the Commerce Department were far rangingexporters. banks. insurers. freight forwarders. and carriers. to name just some. Not only were these American companies asked to assure Arab importers involved in the individual transactions that the items being imported by the Arab firm were not of Israeli origin. American exporters were also asked by Arab importers to guarantee that the carrier transporting the goods involved was not on the Arab League blacklistand this is. perhaps. the most threatening request of all. The way that a company is placed on the Arab League blacklist is for it simply to refuse to end its business dealings with Israel. The Arab League boycott of Israel requires companies basically to choose between doing business with either Israel or Arab League members. but not both. Unfortunately. many U.S. companies have decided that. if it comes to choosing between business with the Arab League or with Israel. they will send their regrets on to Israel. The policy of discrimination Jrnposed by the Arabs against a country with which we have an extremely close and important relationship. one which embodies so well the principles for which our own country stands. should not be joined in by American companies. The facts revealed by the Commerce Department figures indicate that we need to give our companies back a healthy perspective on what it means to be Americans.",

The solution he says he intends to propose next year. if he is elected. is to subsidize lenders so that they can reduce the interest rate during the early years of an FHA mortgage. Subsidizing lenders not only is costly to the taxpayers. who have to make up the difference between the actual rate and the subsidized rate in the taxes they pay. but is a sure way to keep interest rates high for everyone. The only real solution for our housing depression is to bring all interest rates down. and particularly home mortgage interest rates. It cannot be done overnight. by a stroke of the pen enacting a bill into law. Millions upon millions of Americans have been given a vested interest in high interest rates by the returns they are now accustomed to receive on their savings. The process of bringing down interest rates is going to be. slow and. to many savers and investors. rather painfulbut it is going to have to be done if this country is to restore the vitality of our economy and bring homeownership once again within the reach of the average family. not to mention the problem of reducing the incredibly heavy drain on States and municipalities and the Fed-",

CARL ALBERT was the Democratic whip serving under a great leader. Sam Rayburn. who was primarily responsible for the selection of the gentleman from Oklahoma as an important member of the leadership organization. CARL. in 1955. was known as a knowledgeable. hardworking. young Member of Congress. In the more than 20 years that followed his entry into the House leadership. he proved time and time again the wisdom of the Speaker Rayburns choice. and. for the past 6 years. starting with the 92d Congress. he served with distinction as the Speaker of the House of Representatives. These 6 years have witnesed a great deal of change. We have witnessed a great and tragic war. We have faced the complexed problems of critical inflation. At the same time. we suffered a deep recesison. We have lived through the international crisis. which resulted from the oil embargo and we have undergone 2 critical years of turmoil during which the very foundations of our democratic society were shaken and our institutions tested severely. Throughout all of these challenges. CARL ALBERT has conducted the business of the House with fairness. impartiality. and dedication. As I say. he was brought into the leadership structure by Sam Rayburn and ultimately achieved the high leadership position formerly held by the gentleman from Texas. and I would say that CARL ALBERT ranks with him. along with the other greater leaders. John McCormack. Nicholas Longworth. and Henry Clay. as among the most outstanding leaders this Congress has ever seen. I am proud to have been a part of the institution in which he served as majority leader and Speaker. During the 18 years that I have been privileged to serve in the House of Representatives. I have learned tremendously by his advice. counsel. and his example. As one Member of this House. I am going to miss CARL ALBERT deeply. but he certainly is entitled to a long and enjoyable retirement. My wife and I wish the Alberts all the best in the future.

As this country emerged from the cold war era and developed a more open and wider foreign policy toward the other nations of the world. the Congress has made its mark in this area. One of the chief architects of this accomplishment is THOMAs E. MORGAN. the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania who has served so admirably as chairman of the House Committee on International Relations. He has served in that position since 1959. It has been through his effective and direct leadership that the House of Representatives has played its full part in this process. The dean of the Pennsylvania delegation came to the House of Representatives in 1945 and has been reelected overwhelmingly by his constituents in the 22d District in each succeeding election. It is with pleasure that I take this opportunity to express to the House of Representatives my appreciation for the efforts of Doc MORGAN and at the same time to express my regret that he will not be serving in the House of Representatives in the future. We shall certainly miss his wise counsel. his diligent attention to detail. and his statesmanlike manner. Five U.S. Presidents and five Secretaries of State have come and gone during the tenure of Congressman MORGAN.

I am sure that you would agree that 6 months is far too short a time for this goal to even be partially realized. The fact remains. however. that the present course of action which ConRail has taken with regard to New England will result in the destruction of. and not the revitalization of. rail service to that region. The prime example of ConRails apparent neglect of New England is evident in its failure to restore the rail bridge at Poughkeepsie. N.Y. This span across the Hudson River was the major rail gateway to New England prior to its being destroyed by fire in May of 1974. The loss of this bridge has forced rail traffic to New England to be rerouted along the Hudsons west shoreline to upstate Selkirk. N.Y. There is no question that this has caused serious disruption in critical rail freight service to much of New England and New York. More importantly. certain portions of the region. particularly Connecticut. have suffered severe economic hardship due to this disruption in service.",

I also think that if there is a regional problem. such as a river basin. where the Senator is involved and wants to hire somebody with some particular expertise and they all pay a fraction. that that should not be prohibited. I do not think the Senate exceeds the House in purity. There is not any ethical problem involved here. The House has been doing this for years. Furthermore. it is not compulsory. it is permissive.

I think that attitude which they show toward their Government is one which should be recognized by the Senate of the United States as is being proposed today by the able senior Senator from Texas. The Senator from Virginia had a similar letter from a gentleman from Sandston. Va.. recently. in which he attached his check for $200. the refund that he received from the Government. In his letter to me he asked that his name not be used. Therefore. I will. of course. comply with his wishes. but in his letter to me he stated that that represented 30 percent of his total savings account. and yet he felt that he wanted to return that to the Government. because he is deeply concerned as an American citizen by the deficit financing policies of the Government of the United States. I take this occasion to commend my fellow Virginian. who sent me that check to be returned to the Treasury. which I have done. I commend also this very fine couple. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell. from Texas. who likewise have returned their refund.

I think here is an opportunity to take a good look at an area that is definitely under the control of Congress. which appears to many people with whom I have talked as an excess use of personnel to operate the elevator complex that we have in the Capitol area. This amendment would require study and a submission of a plan to reduce by at least 50 percent the number of persons operating automatic elevators within the Capitol complex. I do not know exactly what percentage of the elevators are automatic. but I think it is safe to say that at least 50 percent. and so we are talking about at least a quarter of the elevators for the Senate itself. The salary of the elevator operator is $7.715. There are 70. That amounts to $540.000. There are some people who think that that figure I have may be just the starting salary and it may be a higher figure. So we are talking something about a savings in the Senate alone of $200.000. and for the House of Representatives it would be presumably even a higher figure. I believe that this is a small step but. nonetheless. a step in the right direction of the Congress action in their own backyard to cut down on spending at a very crucial time economically and fiscally for this Nation.",

H.R. 9019 makes a series of amendments to Public Law 93222. the Health Maintenance Organization Act. which this Committee wrote in 1973. That act was designed as a 5year test of the ability of the Federal Government to assist in developing new. comprehensive. prepaid medical groups throughout the country as a means of encouraging preventive medicine. improving the quality of medical care. and restraining the rapid increase in health care costs. Since enactment of Public Law 93222. the program has grown much more slowly than had originally been anticipated and in the last several months our Subcommittee on Health and the Environment has. through hearings and its oversight activities. explored the reasons for this slow evolution in the health maintenance organization program. H.R. 9019 represents the committees conclusions as to what amendments to the original law are necessary to make HMOs more competitive than is possible under the original law and to encourage the proper implementation of the program. The bill will do this by extending the program for 2 years. shifting some of the present authorizations of appropriations into the new years. without additional authorizations of appropriations. simplifying the requirements for supplemental health services and the services of health professionals. dropping the requirement for open enrollment and waiving for 5 years the requirement for community rating. and clarifying the operation of the dual choice provision. You are all aware of the current excessive rise in health care costs going on throughout this country. HMOs are one way of beginning to control those costs and. therefore. deserve your support. This Is a good bill which has been carefully prepared by our committee to encourage the growth of HMOs. and I urge your support for it.",

I would like to make just a few comments about H.R. 9019. the Health Maintenance Organization Amendments of Health maintenance organizationsHMOsare designed to switch the focus of health care from hospitalbased to ambulatory and provide a greater emphasis on primary care and preventive medicine. The consumer pays a monthly or other periodic fee for needed health care services. The available data has shown that there are reduced hospital stays. sometimes up to 50 percent. and as a result substantial financial savings. The consumer generally receives better continuity of care and certainly no reduction in quality. This is due mainly to the emphasis on outpatient primary and preventive care. However. despite the proven advantages and the enactment of enabling legislation. progress in developing and expanding the HMO concept has been disappointing. This is because the current law contains several restrictive provisions. That is what the subcommittee is trying to correct by the legislation we are considering. The amendments will make the formation of HMOs more attractive to potential sponsors. make the law more flexible and responsive to current needs. and result in more accessibility to HMOs by the consumer. I think the most important factor regarding this legislation is that it is a result of consensusconsensus by those involved in HMO development. by labor. by business. by GAO. by medicine and even by the administration. It is important also to remember that the legislation is not intended to be the sole source of support for HMOs. but to encourage additional public and private support.

I supported the Health Maintenance Act of 1973. which subsequently became Public Law 93222. and after having read both of these views I have some reservations about this bill and I would like to propound a question or two to my distinguished colleague. the gentleman from Kentucky. Particularly after having read the gentlemans supplemental views. I wonder if the scope of available health services will be significantly reduced by this bill. I think the gentleman knows what I am referring to. We have many rural and small town areas in America that could be truly classified as medically deprived or medically underserved.

Under the existing law. either House of Congress. by resolution. can disapprove any regulation sent to us under the law by the Federal Election Commission. That procedure has not worked terribly well because. I think we should frankly say. partly because of the failure of the Commission and perhaps partly because of a failure of our own. Nevertheless. it is generally conceded that this disapproval process for regulations. at least until we develop some experience. ought to be maintained. However. Mr. Chairman. this bill before us goes a good deal further. Instead of simply saying that we can veto a regulation or disapprove a regulation. this bill says that we can veto a regulation in whole or in part. Here. again. is another death blow at the independence of the Federal Election Commission because this bill gives the Congress the ability to take any part of a regulation and strike it down. Under our Constitution we do not allow our Federal Executive an item veto of acts of Congress. Many States do not allow that kind of item veto. In almost no cases do we have a veto of regulations of independent commissions. In almost no cases do we have a veto of regulations which we allow the agencies to write. My goodness. we are giving the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare carte blanche authority to write regulations. We let OSHA run around and regulate us without veto. but in this one. because it affects us. we have given ourselves not only the veto. but in this particular bill before us we have given ourselves an item veto.

Now. this classification of violations of less than $5.000 and more than $5.000 is. in my opinion. an irrational one which is capable of mischief. For example. the Members all know that it is illegal to accept a contribution from a corporation. and they all know that it is illegal to accept a contribution from a labor union.

Under this section of the bill. in order to qualify for a criminal penalty. an offense has to be committed in a willful and knowing manner and be over $5.000. or. as seems likely. the Wiggins amendment will be adopted and it must be over $2.500. Now. what that means. of course. is that if one contributes $2.400 over the contribution limit. one will not be subjected to a criminal penalty. One would be subjected only to some kind of a civil penalty. A corporation. as I understand this section of the law. may contribute $2.400 to a campaign and not be subject to criminal penalties. but only subject to civil penalties. It seems to me that it was a good thing in this bill to set up both a civil and criminal procedure. It was a good thing to set up a conciliation procedure. because our aim in this kind of a law is to encourage people to get into politics. not to be so afraid that they will stay out. On the other hand. once we establish an offense or violation. it has to be a willful or knowing one. And once we establish a limitation. it should be a reasonable limitation. We should not say to Stuart Mott. for instance. \"If you want to contribute $2.400 or $4.900 more than you are allowed to under the law. we will only let you off with a civil penalty. there will be no danger of a criminal penalty.\" This amendment offered by the gentleman from California is not severe at all.

I do not know of any great objection to this legislation from the automobile companies. If the Government wants to spend $100 million to do research that private enterprise should do and has done. I suppose industry will accept the results of this legislation. But it is a ridiculous. wasteful expenditure of the taxpayers money. I am glad to call the Senates attention to the fact that the Secretary of Transportation. William Colemanwho. I think. is doing an outstanding job in his positionhas written a very forceful letter to the chairman of the Committee on Commerce. indicating that he opposes the bill and hopes the President will veto it. I. too. hope the President will veto the bill. and that the veto will be sustained in Congress. The letter that Secretary Coleman has written to Senator MAGNUSON states:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to speak in support of H.R. 13655. Last June 14. when the Senate Committee on Commerce version of this bill. S. 1883. came to the floor. I had three objections to the bill. First. it called for the Federal Government to engage in advanced prototype production. In short. the Federal Government was to build a car. Second. the bill failed to emphasize the propulsion system. which I consider the key to further advances in meeting the Nations energy and environmental problems. Third. S. 1883 placed responsibility for the program in the Department of Transportation. I felt the Energy Research and Development Administration. because of its existing role in automobile research and development. would be a more appropriate lead agency. Because of my concerns over these issues. I offered an amendment to S. 1883 which fortunately passed and which placed the program in ERDA. emphasized automotive propulsion systems. and deleted the production prototype program. I am pleased to say that these elements have been retained in the conference report. In particular. the conferees have provided that \"integrated test vehicles\" are exactly that test vehicles. and not production prototypes. It is my belief that there remains more of the fear shared by many of us that the Government was building a vehicle that would be imposed on the American automobile industry. Accordingly. Mr. President. I am pleased to cast my vote In favor of this conference report.",

The second concurrent resolution which was just approved by this body calls for an appropriate level of Federal debt in excess of $700 billion. I think it is no less a matter of concern to the Senator from Idaho than it is to the Senator from Virginia. But Congress has taken various actions in the last several weeks and months that have set appropriate levels of spending. upon the economic premise which the majority has adopted that spending at this level is the only way to work our way out of the recession in which we find ourselves. There is no likelihood under those circumstances that a denial of this program of revenue sharing would in any wise reduce the total amount of Federal expenditure.",

The reason that I offered it. of course. is to relate it to the income increases at the Federal level. which respond to the general state of the economy. partly to meet some of the criticisms of the Senator from Virginia. who said we are unduly burdening the deficit. If we relate it to our receipts. then we are not burdening the deficit further in terms of recession. I would separate the general revenuesharing provisions in the bill and in general law from those which are countercyclical in nature. As income rises at the Federal level. my amendment would have that apportionment rise at the local level. As income fell at the Federal level. the apportionment of the State and local governments would fall. That would leave the adjustment for countercyclical purposes to other provisions of statute than the general revenue sharing. It seems to me that that is more appropriate. that the countercyclical actions should be separated from the general revenue disbursements. Whatever reduction there would be as a result of the income tax cuts we are enacting in Congress would be very small in terms of this total percentage. and certainly if. as a matter of fact. we work our way out of the recession. as the personal income tax receipts to the Federal Government were very greatly increased. our capacity to pay. our capacity to make those disbursements. would increase. Under those circumstances. it is quite possible that the State and local governments would receive a larger disbursement under my amendment than they would under the committee amendment. But if. on the contrary. the economy does not respond as well. it seems to me that. in logic at least. the general revenue sharing that would go to the State and local governments would. correspondingly. not increase as rapidly. leaving to Congress. then. the opportunity to allocate whatever spending it does through programs designed to be stimulative rather than simply general revenue sharmg.",

In all fairness. the formula right now does not even keep up with the inflation we have had in the past. and what we have built into it does not even keep up with the inflation if the inflation is 5 percent a year. and I have seen very few projections that project less than 5 percent a year for the next 2 years.

The legislation authorizing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area in northeastern Ohio was signed by the President in December of 1974. I particularly want to thank the committee for its consideration in the land acquisition funds that have been authorized totaling some $5 million during the next fiscal year and the partial year. that has been provided already and was put in even though it was omitted from the budget. I think. originally. by oversight. However. the original request for operation and maintenance funding for the park was some $80.000 for fiscal year 1976. and again I want to say I appreciate the committees giving us $75.000 of that to handle three additional positions needed if the park is to progress and the land acquisition program is to proceed. However. no funding has been included in the budget for any of the areas authorized after the budget was prepared. It has now been learned that the State of Ohio intends to turn over 3.300 acres of State parkland to the Federal recreation area during the fiscal year 1976. In order to maintain this land we are advised by the Park Service that an additional amount of $20.000 at least may be needed. and it was requested by the Park Service. This total figure of $100.000 for operation and maintenance was supported by the Department of Interior. Only $75.000 has been provided. However. as I say. I think we can perhaps be able to handle that amount as the time comes and as the State land is acquired.

It is my pleasure to call to the attention of my colleagues the record of this outstanding educator and citizen. Compassion. understanding. and dedication are the threads which have run through the life of William Garner Miles as he traveled from his birthplace in Melfa. Va.. to Prince Georges County. Md. He earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. For 30 years. Mr. Miles life has been dedicated to helping thousands of children in Prince Georges County. During his period of service to the county. he has been instrumental in initiating and developing many creative programs. He began the first program in Prince Georges County for academically talented children while he was principal at Glenridge Junior High School. Mr. Miles first came to Prince Georges County in 1945. He was a core teacher at Hyattsville Junior High School for 7 years and became vice principal of Hyattsville Junior High School in 1953. In 1954. he became principal of the new Glenridge Junior High School in Landover Hills. Md. In the early 1960s. Prince Georges County was one of the fastest growing counties in the United States. and during Mr. Miles tenure at Glenridge the school grew from a student body of 600 to 1.400. This growth and changing population was challenging and required innovative leadership which Mr. Miles provided. Because Mr. Miles was one of the early junior high school principals in Prince Georges Countywhen junior high schools here were fewand because of his experience during the growth years of the county. Mr. Miles was again called upon to open a second new school. William Wirt Junior High School in Riverdale. Md. For over a decade. Mr. Miles again accepted the responsibilities and challenges of a new community and new student population. We salute William Garner Milesa scholar. a teacher. a man. a friend. a human beingwho has made outstanding achievements and who has always been dedicated to the service of his fellow man.",

The article goes on to explain that most of these accidents could be eliminated by the enforcement of what is known as a nohandsindies rule. It also explains that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. the Government agency responsible for protecting the safety of workers on their jobsites. has revoked a nohandsindies rule on the grounds that it is unnecessary and not feasible. Mr. Speaker. with 307 workers losing hands in 1 year in the State of Michigan alone. I feel that this rule is far from unnecessary. Further statistics show that 3 out of every 500 workers could expect to lose a hand or portion of a hand every year. and that almost 1 out of every 5 workers would suffer such an injury over a 30year career. Again. this tragedy Is continuing. in large part. because of OSHAs decision to revoke this rule. It seems apparent. Mr. Speaker. that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is not utilizing the mandate Congress gave it in legislation we enacted in 1970. Much more progress could be made in protecting our workers from dangerous and hazardous working conditions if the provisions of this act were carried out more thoroughly and more vigorously enforced. There can be no doubt that improved safety devices for these and other machines are necessary. These devices will cost money. but the Federal Government can well afford the comparatively slight cost necessary to enforce the nohandsindies rule and promotion of safetyimproving devices. if it saves human limbs. After all. what price or cost can one attribute to the loss of a hand? Mr. Speaker. at this point. I would like to insert the text of this article into the RECORD: [From the Washington Post.

We made that point time and again on both sides. The Senators reasoning is correct. It was my motion. It failed on a tie vote. My motion was to go back and retrieve all of those not at all knowing whether there were more \"skipWyman\" or more \"skipDurkin.\" but it seemed to me proper to go back and get them all since the committee was passing judgment on something which the officials of New Hampshire had long held could not possibly be applied to their election laws. So when my motion failed on a tie. the point I am making is that the Senator from Alabamaand if I can attempt to reason with myself as to why he did itwas probably motivated by the feeling that the committee had arbitrarily taken away 12 votes which it had no right to take away. and was seeking perhaps to try to decide the election by this arbitrary rule whereby 12 ballots for Wyman were destroyed on tie votes. meaning in each case for Wyman. 4 no vote. He therefore proposed that we seek to retrieve an equal number. The committee voted for that 5 to 3. that is my point. But after lunch they came back. and some of the committee .members said. \"Oh. we thought you meant only the 3.500.\" But at that time they had to know there were no more \"skipcandidate\" ballots in the 3.500. Therefore. the motion could only have applied to hunt where the rabbits were outside of the 3.500. However. the motion to reconsider was tied also.",

So when they got to the ballot law commission a number of these protests were not aired before them but only selected protests were picked out by both sides. and the ballot law commission agreed to hear 400. Those 400 were heard and the ballot law commission made its findings. Now then. all of the protests which had been heard. plus all of the protests which had not been heard by the challenges on both sides were carted down here to the Senate and argued. as they could contend. I think. de novo. at least as far as the argument was concerned. and the Senate Rules Committee then heard the petitions. Out of those petitions there emerged. I think somewhat to the surprise of the people of New Hampshire. a pattern in 12 cases whereby nobody in New Hampshire ever before had anticipated that that question could arise. It had never been so upheld. The people who argue that cannot cite a single case for it. There is not a case supporting it. There is nothing except an overture in the Murchie case that the intent of the voter prevailed. But in the Langer case it was said that the voter must find a means of giving expression to his intent within the law. That is the only argument. No one argues that is the law of New Hampshire.

It seeks to limit the consideration of those ballots. which are 3.500 here. ballots which were protested validly and timely before. first. the secretary of state. and the ballot law commission in New Hampshire. What the amendment seeks to do is to continue to drag this case out by trying to find any ballots which were not timely protested. Mr. President. this amendment pertains not only to the socalled skipLouie ballots. but really pertains as well to issues Nos. 1. 2. 3. 6. and 7. in that in each of these issues it is sought to go back and rehash area and ground that has already been covered. Mr. President. in a rule of law society. in a system of laws. there is always a time to act. We have times set up in our legal system for filing petitions. for answering complaints. for making protests. for filing claims on an open account. for being able to exercise any right under the law. There are times prescribed. That is part and parcel of the law. It has been since Roman times and throughout history. The State of New Hampshire also has time for protest. Under the law of the State of New Hampshire. if a recount is requested. you first go to the secretary of state and make your first protest there and only those ballots which are protested before the secretary of state may later be protested and ruled upon by the ballot law commission. So it is that in the instant case. when a recount became obvious. both candidates went to the secretary of state and protested some 3.500 ballots.",

How could they ever believe that this body would take an election away from a man duly elected? There were no challenges on the skipcandidate votes in the New Hampshire proceeding. When they came here. they were a great surprise to those of us on the bench because they had been given random numbers and they lay all the way around in these 950 ballots.

His amendment would restore funds sufficient to provide for the continuation of production of synthetic fuels from coal and oil shale at experimental plants of the Bureau of Mines. It would seem to be a sound conservation policy and in the national interest to go forward with the development of this program which would shift as much demand as possible from our limited petroleum supplies to our very large coal reserves. The development of syntheticfuel processes offers a means of doing this. Coal has not held its output level since 1920. Instead of sharing very much in the new markets. it has lost its old markets. such as ships. railroads. and homes. In many areas the coal industry is in a depressed state. some mines are working only a few days a week. and in other cases shut down. In the years ahead coal can provide the answer to Americas liquidfuels problem. and I believe that in view of the remarks which have been offered here today the fundamental research that has been conducted paves the way toward the consummation of this objective. We would. therefore. in my opinion. be pennywise and poundfoolish to discontinue funds at this time providing for the continuation of a program which promises within a few short years to perfect processes whereby synthetic fuels and valuable chemicals may be derived from a raw material virtually unlimited in its supply.

These advisers have gone so far as to characterize Mr. Solzhenitsyns views as \"a threat to peace.\" It is difficult to understand how truth can be a threat to peace.

Beyond this. the Soviet Union is an armed camp. with an ever larger percentage of its gross national product spent on military weapons.

Such a \"dtente.\" however. serves only the purposes of the Soviet Union. Both the cause of peace and of human dignity are ill served by such a policy. Fortunately. the American people sense the truth of Alexandr Solzhenitsyns words and the shabbiness of their reception by official Washington. Many Americans have written to their Representatives in the Congress and to their newspapers expressing their dismay at the failure of our governmental leaders to give Mr. Solzhenitsyn the reception he deserves.

We kept telling them to do nothing. to leave the economy alone. They didnt want to take our advice. but the government was unable to form or implement an emergency program to save Italy. So.

They succeeded a couple of years ago in preventing construction of a proposed crossing over Long Island Sound. known as the RyeOyster Bay Bridge. I have had the pleasure of working with these people overtime in efforts to promote mass transit and block illadvised highway schemes. Many of them worked. as I did. in 1971 for the defeat of a multibillion dollar bond issue proposed by New York State which would have had tremendous adverse environmental and transportation effects and which would have increased the States debt to even higher levels than it then was. We were mightily pleased by the success of that effort. in that it demonstrated some success of the education effort such citizens organizations have been making these past 10 years. Several organizations have recently published a flyer about railroads in the Northeast and Midwest which critiques some of the actionsand nonactionsof the Federal Government in supposed efforts to save the rail systems. I would like to share with my colleagues the text of this well thought out flyer. entitled \"The Great Rail Hoax. or How the Federal Government Plans to Save the Railroads by Destroying Them.\" It was prepared by Sound Action. a group in my district which is affiliated with the New York State Transportation Council. the Northeast Transportation Coalition. and the Northeast Corridor Rail Action.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in a discussion of the merits of any international human rights treaty. we must ask ourselves what we hope to accomplish by means of such a treaty. Some people oppose U.S. participation in human rights treaties on the grounds that the treaties are meaningless documents which never can nor will be enforced. These opponents ask why we should sign an agreement which is nothing more than an exercise in futility. I contend that human rights treaties. and the Genocide Convention in particular. are far from worthless attempts to impose unenforceable standards on all nations. On the contrary. I believe that these treaties have great potential benefits which can be realized only if we are a party to such agreements. The Genocide Convention officially recognizesThat genocide. whether committed in time of peace or in time of war. is a crime under international law which they the Contracting Parties undertake to prevent and to punish. The treaty seeks to prevent the destruction of national. racial. ethnic. or religious groups by defining genocide. outlawing it. and establishing procedures for trying and punishing all violators. We have no guarantee. of course. that our ratification of the convention will enhance the efficacy of the contract. The relative ineffectiveness of the convention in the past as a medium for combating genocide is no reason for us to abandon the convention altogether. The structure established to prevent and punish genocide remains intact but untried. Our ratification of the treaty might activate the structure from its dormant state so that the world can unite against mass murderers. Perhaps even more important than the potential tangible benefits are the intangible benefits which would result from ratification of the Genocide Convention. The 84 nations which have ratified the convention cannot understand why we fail to join them. Our support of the convention will erase the suspicion with which other nations view us in this matter. Senate ratification will demonstrate our agreement with other signators on basic principles of human rights. Such agreement on principles is necessary to enhance the existing atmosphere of international cooperation and trust. only through which we can hope to build a more humane world.",

PolishAmericans rightly place special importance upon this dayit is an anniversary which not only commemorates a nations continuing struggle for liberty. it is also a day to pay tribute to a people and a nation whose pursuit of freedom is a challenge and an inspiration to all Americans. The heritage of the Polish Insurrection is one replete with acts of courage and sacrifice in behalf of ideals which all Americans cherish. In 1863. young Polish leaders rose in armed defiance against their conquerorscalling upon their countrymen to unite in the cause of freedom. And although they lost this difficult battle. their cause won because it was just. From defeat rose a new movement for independence which would continue to sound the call of freedom. as it still does to this day. The young Polish freedomfighter did not give his life in vain. Today he serves as an inspiration to Poles. to Americans. and to people everywhere who treasure mans greatest righthis right to be free. America is a stronger and wiser Nation for the contributions of its citizens of Polish heritage. As Americans. they have assisted in the building of a great Nation. and have continuously contributed to the fiber of Americas spiritual wealth. During our Bicentennial.

S.C.. and the members of the South Carolina State Agency of Vocational Rehabilitaton. Vocational Rehabilitation Department. for their excellent work in the field of vocational rehabilitation. This department was established in 1957 by the South Carolina General Assembly. as an independent agency consisting of seven members. one from each congressional district and one memberatlarge. appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate. The present members of the agency are as follows: E. Roy Stone. Jr.. chairman. Greenville. Dr. H. L. Laffitte. vicechairman. Allendale. Dr. T. James Bell. Jr.. Hartsville. John A. Montgomery. Columbia. Daniel E. Martin. Charleston. Harry W. Findley. Anderson. and E. H. Carroll of Rock Hill. Under the direction of these men and Dr. Dill D. Beckman. executive officer and commissioner. this South Carolina agency has been ranked first in the Nation for the second consecutive year. in the number of rehabilitations per 10.000 of the disabled population. The Vocational Rehabilitation Department has also an outstanding record of cooperation with other public and private agencies. in order to provide enriched services and to avoid duplication of services to the disabled. This cooperative spirit is apparent on all levels of the operation. The results of the agencys varied programs are exemplary. For example. during the fiscal year 197475. there were 13.143 rehabilitants taking part in the various programs. The rehabilitated workers increased their earning power 469 percent because of the rehabilitation services and correspondingly their earnings increased from $8.948.056 before rehabilitation to $50.882.000 after rehabilitation. Almost 80 percent of those rehabilitated were not earning anything at all when they were accepted Into the programs. Mr. President. I am proud to say that this agency is one which pays its own way and does not load down either Federal or State payrolls with inefficient and nonproductive programs. The projected total annual income of those 13.143 persons rehabilitated in 197475 will be $50.882.000. Based on these figures. the rehabilitants will repay. in Federal and State taxes. the full cost of their rehabilitation in 4.8 years. Mr. President. I know of very few programs which offer so much in return for the relatively small amount invested.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the state of the Union message and the budget proposals issued by President Ford this week contain bad news and good news for older Americans. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing for the Senate Committee on Aging. I take some satisfaction from what might be regarded as a welcome change of policy upon the part of the executive branch. I am referring to the administrations request for $375 million in lending authority for the 202 direct loan program to provide housing for older Americans. The budget message says that this amount will make 16.000 units available. In addition. $375 million would be released for section 202 loans in 1976. Thus. for the first time during Mr. Fords administration and that of his predecessor. the Office of Management and Budget is supporting a request for Those of us in the Congress who have persistently defended 202 over the years and have refused to let it die can take a great deal of satisfaction from this development. It appears that the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentafter many struggles. including a dispute over proposed regulations last yearwill now vigorously implement 202. But it is also necessary for 202 supporters to keep their perspective. Welcome as the funding request is. it appears to be far short of the full potential of 202. In the few months since HUD invited applications for 202 projects from nonprofit sponsors. more than 1.500 proposals have poured in. At least 700 of them. I am informed by HUD. are substantial and in complete harmony with 202 objectives. And from that 700. only 100 can be chosen. It is clear that the Congress must keep a close watch over 202 to determine a more realistic funding level. It is also clear that a strategy for meeting all housing needs of older Americans cannot depend upon one or even two or three programs. The needs of individuals vary. particularly among the elderly. For this reason. I will pursue the examination of congregate housing begun by my subcommittee last year. and I will also look * into other means of helping to maintain independence or semiindependence of the elderly.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. during last years debate on the Diego Garcia issue I stated that. in my opinion. the Indian Ocean was primarily a European. not an American responsibility. I pointed out at that time that the Europeans have the naval forces to meet that responsibility and that France in particular maintains a large Indian Ocean force. The Baltimore Sun of January 19 noted that: France will increase its presence in the Indian Ocean by sending two attack submarines and a logistics support ship to the area. official sources reported yesterday. This would increase the number of French warships in the area to 14. including the helicopter carrier Jeanne dArc. This confirms both that the Europeans. in particular the French. are willing and able to take a leadership role in the Indian Ocean. and that France is once again providing the diplomatic and military leadership which Europe needs. Contrary to what many seem to think. European nations are not incapable of defending their own vital interests. It is not always necessary that the United States take the initiative. on the grounds that the Europeans cannot provide effective leadership. France has time and again demonstrated the ability to take bold initiatives in diplomatic matters. initiatives which serve the interests not only of France but of all Europe. The French have also been willing to invest in the military forces needed to back up such initiatives. As I said at the time of the Diego Garcia debate. the United States should welcome such initiatives on the part of France and of other European states. We should not preempt situations where European interests are predominant. In the long run American as well as European interests are best served by having the Europeans lead in those areas. military and diplomatic. where Americas concerns are less direct than those of Europe.

But the British commission itself chose to present its most magnificent giftand they felt this was appropriatedirectly to the people through the peoples representatives in the Congress and not to the people through the Executive branch. As far as the invitation of the delegation and the numbers included are concerned. I have no information about those matters except from the letter that was sent by the House of Lords and the House of Commons indicating that they would wish to receive as an appropriate number for the ceremonies that they had planned in Great Britain 25 Members of the Senate and the House. along with their wives and appropriate supporting staff.",

I think the gentlewoman from Louisiana has stated it accurately. The President of the United States asked the Government of the United Kingdom to participate in the Bicentennial Celebration. The Government of the United Kingdom took that matter very seriously and gave it long consideration. There was some consultation with people of the United States as to the suitability of what they proposed to do. It was agreed that it would be a magnificent gesture if they sent a copy of this great document to the United States. In the implementation of that agreement they decided that they wanted to schedule a set of ceremoniesand I understand there are 3 days of ceremoniesand they asked that the United States Congress. which will have control of the document. send 25 Members. the Speaker to be the leader of the delegation and the remainder of the delegation to be made up of 12 Members of the Senate and 12 Members of the House. They specifically asked that it include the possibility of wives coming and. if necessary. of staff accompanying the Members. There will have to be staff for the leader of the delegation. I do not know what other staff there might be. but it would seem to me there would be a limited number of staff members. My understanding is that the spouses who go will go without expense to the Government on a spaceavailable basis. and their husbands and wives will be expected to pay their incidental expenses. Mr. Speaker. it seems to me that what we have said. I think two or three times. is an accurate depiction of the invitation by the President of the United States implemented by the United Kingdom in consultation with the U.S. Government.",

There has been the desire of some who are familiar with this program to permit the opportunity for private corporations to undertake some contracting agreements to attempt to provide the needed medical manpower. This amendment would permit the opportunity for the Indian health service program to develop such contracts. Although I regret that we have to go this kind of route and although I am extremely hopeful that with the development of our health manpower program. which has the support.

I give assurance to those who have sponsored this program. who are concerned about the adequacy of health manpower. that we do believe that the Health Service Corps. which I find to be one of the very important and imaginative programs. to try to deal with supplying health manpower in areas of critical shortages. may in the future be able to provide the kinds of relief in terms of manpower that the Indian Health Service program needs. It is not of that dimension at the present time. The sponsors of the amendment feel that this kind of arrangement can be helpful and useful in supplying manpower. and I do not object to it.

These hearings were held In 1973 and since that time they are still having difficulty in recruiting personnel for the Aberdeen area. While the National Health Service Corps and its cooperative recruitment program is doing a very good job with regard to the mass attraction of health personnel. they have been unable to recruit for the isolated communities. like Aberdeen. At best. this recruitment effort is extremely difficult in the private sector. however. for government service. given the end of the doctors draft. it is near impossible. The Indian Health Service has indicated that they feel there may be other avenues to follow in the recruitment area in the nongovernmental area. however. due to restrictions placed on recruitment assistance from without the government by the Federal personnel system. they are unable to avail themselves of this help. In order to aid the IHS and the Indians to obtain physician services. an amendment Is needed to the Public Health Service Act which would allow the IHS to utilize outside help or assistance for this critical problem. Since time is of the essence in this matter. the change is needed as soon as possible so that the Indian Health Sewice may be about the business of filling these much needed slots within the Service. Therefore. the amendment is offered to deal with this problem. The amendment Is technical in nature in that it would only permit the Indian Health Service to obtain assistance in this area if they felt it might help solve this problem.",

The waiver is necessary for the Senate to complete action on legislation which provides authorizations for the Federalaid highway program for the transition quarter ending September 30. 1976. and fiscal years 1977 and 1978. The authorization of funds in S. 2711 does not increase program levels but maintains continuity in the highway program and allows the States to continue highway construction at reasonable levels. The waiver is also necessary since legislative requirements in other programs under the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Public Works will occupy the time of the committee during the second session of the Ninetyfourth Congress.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in Sundays New York Times Magazine. Prof. Robert L. Heilbroner. of the New School for Social Research in New York. wrote an article on national economic planning the United States. Professor Heilbroners thesis is that planning is coming to the United States because the business community will soon demand economic planning as an instrument to save the private enterprise system. Professor Heilbroner makes it clear that planning is no panacea. as I have said repeatedly. To quote Professor Heilbroner: We cannot plan better than we can govern. Planning will force us to discover how well that is. Professor Heilbroner makes it clear that as the scale of private enterprise changes. business becomes even more enmeshed in social problems. and thus the cry for regulation grows. He regards the slogan \"that the solution is not for more Government direction but less\" as a prescription for a world that does not exist. This explains why every capitalist economy has a growing core of economic planning. This point was clearly brought home to me on my recent trip to Latin America. during which I met with the Minister of Planning in Brazil. Panama. and Colombia. All three of these economies are among the least regulated in Latin America. especially Brazil. Nevertheless. the planning process is important to government and business in Brazil and helps the Government to establish the priorities under which the free enterprise system functions so efficiently. Planning does not mean regimentation. It does mean giving serious and coordinated thought to our future course. I feel that it is most important for American businessmen to study the f avorable relationship between planning and business in such countries as Brazil and France. Professor Heilbroners article is an outstanding contribution to the current debate on national economic planning. Representative HARRINGTON has already put this article in the RECORD in two parts under Extensions of Remarks. For the convenience of Members. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Professor Heilbroners article be printed in the RECORD.",

While the United States was one of the United Nations foremost proponents of the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. and fought vigorously to gain the Assemblys approval of the treaty. we have still not ratified the Convention.

As the foremost democratic nation in the world. the United States has a major role to play in promoting universal adherence to international law based on concrete guarantees of freedom and justice.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the National Association of Manufacturers recently issued an informative document entitled \"A Fiscal Policy for the Future.\" This report is an excellent source of information concerning the financial needs of the private sector and how Federal fiscal policy affects those needs. As my colleagues know. I have expressed a growing concern for the continued vitality of our Nations private sector. Inflation and unemployment have been viewed in recent years as our principal economic problems. Among other actions taken. Congress has reacted to them by enacting wage and price contol legislation to cure inflation and various massive spending programs to provide temporary jobs for the unemployed. Inflation and high unemployment are bothersome symptoms of a more serious problem. one which could prove to be devastating for the quality of life we Americans have developed through hard work and a series of fortunate circumstances. That underlying problem is the financial weakness of the private sector of our economy. In October 1975. there was a total of 86.023.000 persons working in the civilian labor force either as selfemployed workers. on wages and salaries. or as unpaid family members in both the nonagricultural and. agricultural sectors. Of that total. 71.411.000or 83 percentwere employed in the private sector. The remaining 14.612.000--or 17 percentwere working for either the Federal Government2.716.000or for State and local governments--11.896.000. These figures clearly illustrate the value of the private sector in our economy. Several reputable studies on private sector financial needs were published during 1975. Most studies concluded that the capital needs of the private sector during the next 10 years will not be met given present economic conditions and Federal policies. Mr. President. Federal policies have led to this weakening of the private sector. The heart of the problem is that the Nations financial resources have been directed by Government toward nonproductive activities and. thereby away from productive activities. This trend must be reversed immediately. To do otherwise would assure the continued deterioration of the private sector. thereby resulting in higher unemployment and financial instability.

This timetable is critical in order to assist local governments in finalizing their budgets for the 1977 fiscal year. As my colleagues know. revenue sharing will expire on December 31. 1976. Without early reenactment. recipients will be unable to include any revenue sharing in their fiscal year 1977 budgets. which are now being prepared.

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday the Senate passed. by a 94toO vote. emergency housing legislation and sent It to the House. This legislation covered a number of areas. The most controversial part of it related to $10 billion that was to be made available at 7.5 percent for mortgagees with a 1 percent maximum for fees and charges. The House took the bill. amended that particular part by eliminating the limit on fees and mortgages. and sent it back here. I was very. very much opposed to what the House did. in fact. so strongly opposed. although there are some good features of the bill. I felt I could not in good conscience recommend it to the Senate and would do my very best to prevent it from passing in that form. I am happy to say we have worked out an agreement with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. and I have a letter here which I will take a minute to read from Mr. Daniel P. Kearney. who is president of the Government National Mortgage Association. who writes as follows: This is In response to your inquiry concerning the policy of the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) with respect to fees and charges to be allowed under the Emergency Housing Act of 1975. At the present time. GNMAs fees and charges total 21/2 percent. participating lenders are allowed to charge an origination fee not to exceed 2 percent. I have dlscased these policies with Secretary Carla Hills and she has authorized me to assure you that until July 1. 1976 (the expiration date of the law) the total fees levied by GNMA and the origination fees allowed to participating lenders will not exceed 4 percent. That is the crux. the 4 percent will be the limit. that is. the 4 points will be the limit. We have calculated that as an effective yield for mortgages of 7.92 percent. He concludesand this is the president of the Government National Mortgage Associationas follows: Should Treasury borrowing costs rise significantly. we would. of course. strongly recommend enactment of the BrookeCranston amendment to the statutory formula. Mr. President. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. who is the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee of the Banking Committee.",

The final paragraph of the letter that Mr. Kearney sent to Senator PROXMIRE.

The bill to which Mr. Kearney refers is a bill which Senator CRANSTON and I introduced about 5 or 6 months ago. It is not law at the present time. and it may very well not become law. but it will be a question for Congress. I think this would be no more than the fact that they may have to take that recommendation to us if the situation should be that the costs rise significantly.",

This is calculated. and we calculated it carefully. as a yield of 7.92 percent. This is substantially below the present market rate for mortgages and. for that reason. it seems to me that the family that cannot now afford to buy a home will be able to buy a home because this will be a substantially lesser rate. and that means their monthly payments will be less. and this should open up more housing. more jobs. This is what we are working for. The cost to the Government. on the basis of everything I have seen. will be negligible because the cost of money to the Government is less than this 7 2 percent.

I have a brief statement that I would like to read in connection with another part of the bill which will take me about a minute to read. and I think I should bring it to the attention of the Senate. Mr. President. the legislation before us authorizes GNMA to purchase both Govelnmentassisted mortgages and conventionally financed mortgages. At the present time the FHA mortgages authorized to be purchased by GNMA make no provision for mortgages to finance section 202 housing for the elderly. Housing for the elderly has been a very. very successful program. a vital program. a program that has overwhelming support. and on which there virtually have been no foreclosures. I think it is the most successful housing program our Government has. In fact. the Administration has limited the use of section 202 to construction lending but has made no provision for longterm financing of such housing for the elderly. This new emergency program with interest rates at 71/2 percent could be very effective in financing section 202 housing. I hope that the administration will issue regulations to include mortgages to finance section 202 housing for the elderly. Thus with 202 funds for construction loans and with a 7/2percent FHAinsured mortgage for the longterm financing the purposes of Congress in supporting housing for the elderly will be carried out.",

Moreover. by failing to insist on a complementary and concrete agreement on mutual and balanced force reductionsas the substantive counterpart for the pious declarations produced by CSCEthe Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe will continue and doubtless even grow. a military presence which still has as one of its principal objectives stifling the human. cultural. and political rights of the peoples in that region.",

Lee. retroactive to June 13. 1865. The vote was 407 to 10. meeting the required twothirds approval mandated by the third section of the 14th amendment to the U.S. -Constitution. This is a step which has been a long time in coming. Indeed. it is a step which should have been taken by the Nation long ago. We in this Congress can add nothing to the fame of Robert E. Lee. nor does this resolution add to his stature. It does. however. accomplish that which General Lee himself sought 110 year ago. The qualities of his character. his compassion and his sense of duty are known to any person who has taken even the most casual interest in the history of our great Nation. In my estimation. Robert E. Lee and his contemporary and adversary. Abraham Lincoln. are two of the greatest men this Nation has produced. One of the finest eulogies of General Lee that I have ever read was a brief oration by Senator Benjamin J. Hill of Georgia. who served in the Senate of the United States from March 4. 1877. until his death August 16. 1882. The text of Senator Hills speech was brought to my office last week by my friend Miss Janet W. Meetze of Alexandria. Miss Meetze. a native of Fauquier County. Va.. presented me with a beautiful handprinted and painted illumination of the 19th century eulogy of Robert E. Lee. She had found the text of Senator Hills speech in a newspaper which had been saved by her grandmother. On this day on which the House of Representatives voted to restore full rights of citizenship to General Lee.

So we agree in philosophy on that. But I should like to ask the Senator from Virginia how he can reconcile the fact that 39 States now have adopted legislation creating. in effect. a consumer protection agency. that 33 Governors last year endorsed the concept of a Federal agency for consumer protection. In our Federal system we have the good virtue of being able to try out ideas in our respective States. First one State adopted the idea of fair employment practice laws. then another State. then another State in the South. the West. the North. and the Midwest. You can try these ideas out and then finally. after it is proven that it is valuable and necessary. we ultimately adopt a national policy. and we have done that in an infinite number of areas. Here. consumer protection started out in one State. then another State. and finally approximately 39 States have created that concept. But they are the very ones that would come down and say. \"There are certain things we can do in our States but. just like environmental laws. it is probably better to have a national pattern once you have established the principle. because in our own State we cannot be effective in regulating a national situation or prescribing guidelines for a national situation.\" Or when we get. for instance. in the case of housing scandals all over the country. involving collusion between unions. contractors. brokers. and real estate dealers defrauding the Federal Government and defrauding poor peoplea consumer advocate. and ombudsman. at the national level could have detected that pattern far more quickly than grand juries conducting piecemeal inquiries all over the country and duplicating an effort that could have been done much more economically and much more easily by a Federal agency at the outset.

We do not need to have a consumer advocate administrator who says what is best for the American consumer. The American consumer can speak for himself. He always has. The Senator says there are 39 State consumer protection agencies. To me that would negate the need to have a Federal consumer protection agency. Apparently the States are meeting the need. If the States are doing the job. it is not necessary to have the Federal Government to get into the act. Furthermore. this bill would impose another agency over one that is charged with the responsibility to represent the public interest. We were discussing the Federal Trade Commission a few minutes ago. and before that going back to the Federal Communications Commission under the amendment of the Senator from Washington. Under this bill we would have a duplication of agencies in almost every field. I am saying when we are talking about protecting consumers we have innumerable agencies now to protect them but with all our Government agencies. at all levels they can still best protect themselves.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. my amendment would strike the committee amendment on page 36. line 20 through 22. The committee amendment struck out the exemption relating to Agency for Consumer Advocacy Intervention in Federal Communications Commission proceedings having to do with renewals of radio or television broadcasting licenses. By striking the committee amendment. we would restore the exemption and insure that the ACA does not get bogged down in the endless procedures of the FCC which deal with broadcast license renewals. It must be pointed out that in no way would this action deprive the ACA of participation in other FCC activities. it is limited only to license renewal proceedings for broadcasting stations. The exemption was contained in last years Senate bill and was overwhelmingly supported on the floor by a 57 to 17 vote to reject its deletion. There are many good reasons for this exemption. This legislation is to assist consumers. Renewal proceedings bear no resemblance to the marketplace transactions that are the focal point of the bill. and it should be obvious that there are no such transactions between the broadcaster and his viewers and listeners. Even if. by some stretch of the imagination. the broadcasterlistener/viewer relationship could be interpreted as a \"consumer\" one. it would be farfetched to claim that the interest is substantial enough to require ACA participation. Practical problems are also involved. Onethird of all licenses are up for renewal each year. and the new Agency would spend thousands of manhours on renewal proceedings which have little impact on the Nations consumers while neglecting those areas of concern which are of the greatest importance to the consumer. The exemption is a limited one: it would extend to only the license renewal process and not prevent the ACA from participating in other matters before the FCC such as rulemaking procedures which affect the entire industry rather than a single radio or television station. We feel strongly that such an intrusion is in violation of the first amendment and. furthermore. is discriminatory against the broadcast industry. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the exemption in S. 200 of FCC license renewal proceedings is important. The same exemption was contained in S. 707 which was considered by the Senate last year. As I understand. it is contained in the Taft substitute which is pending before the Senate this year. The increasing frequency of license challenges by citizen groups and others has already greatly increased the cost of successfully getting a radio or TV station license renewed. One study by the National Association of Broadcasters indicates that some stations have spent over $1 million to maintain their licenses. The Senator from Kansas will add that that is not the average cost. That may be a very high cost. The median cost reported in the survey was somewhere in the neighborhood of $300.000. There is nothing to prevent repeated challenges to broadcast licenses every 3 years when licenses come up for renewal. It is. therefore. important that we not allow a federally funded Government agency to interject itself into these renewal proceedings. Already the FCC is charged with the responsibility to insure that \"the public interest. convenience. and necessity\" is served by every license renewal. The interjection of the ACA into the license renewal process would only add another layer of Government to the already confused license renewal process. The committee amendment which removes the FCC license renewal exemption should be stricken. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the abbreviated report of the study by the NAB with reference to station expenses incurred in license challenges be printed in the RECORD.",

I strongly believe that the consumer voice should be better heard in the Federal Government.

This is great legislation for the Senate. We exempt the powerful. That is what this is all about. It is a different concept. though it is a rather interesting one for the country. We are not exempting items that relate to the poor or to those who are in need in terms of health. nutrition. or what have you.

Many people are angry at television for one reason or another. I become angry with it sometimes. too.

I do not really believe that there is going to be any damage to the rights of consumers. I also address myself to an earlier point raised by the Senator from Connecticut. I believe that the most difficulty with the ACA would be with the small and mediumsized stations. I suppose there will be consumer groups presenting challenges. when they determine there should be challenges. to some of the big city VHF television stations. As disorderly as this makes the license renewal process. the large. urban TV stations can afford it. I know it is difficult to separate what we call big from small or medium sized. But I believe that the RECORD will show that the amendment would primarily benefit the small operators. the middlesized operators who cannot easily absorb the tremendous expense which might be incurred by a license challenge from the ACA. Therefore. the amendment does not represent an effort to pick out of this bill some giant network or large VHF TV stations.

I am submitting today. for myself and Senator BROOKE. an amendment in the form of a substitute to S. 399. legislation to establish the Boston Harbor National Recreation Area. Boston Harbor includes 47 square miles of water. 180 miles of irregular tidal shoreline. and 30 islands. Three million people live within 25 miles of the Harbor. and since 1965 a concerted effortat all levels of government has attempted to restore Boston Harbor Islands to these citizens for their use and enjoyment. Congressman JOE MOAKLEY. who Is introducing Identical legislation today in the House of Representatives. began the struggle to preserve and protect these Harbor Islands in the Massachusetts legislature by securing passage of State legislation to acquire the islands. Since that time. the Massachusetts Area Planning Council completed Its comprehensive report on the recreational potential of the islands and proposed plans on how to achieve the revitalization of the Harbor. Efforts to clean up the Harbor and its waters are being accelerated. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Commonwealth recently announced agreement on a 10year. $800 million construction program to improve water pollution control facilities. representing the largest single water pollution control effort ever undertaken in the New England area. I wish to quote at this point a part of that announcement which describes the goals of that program: The program announced by EPA Regional Administrator John A. S. McGlennon. and Massachusetts Environmental Affairs Secretary Evelyn Murphy is designed to improve Boston Harbor and the Neponset and Charles Rivers. so that these waterways will be fishable and swimmable at the end of the construction period. ihe program will coincide with plans to develop the Boston Harbor Islands for greater public use. Once completed. the project would make Boston Harbor one of the cleanest metropolitan waters in the eastern part of the country.\" I am very pleased that the Army Corps of Engineers has resumed work on the Boston Harbor debris study and expects its work to be completed by 1977. In 1966. I sponsored the resolution which authorized the corps to begin the study of debris sources which are both hazardous and detrimental to the development of the recreational potential of the islands. I ask unaminous consent to have printed in the RECORD at this point the Corps letter to Mayor White and their description of the program.",

Under his leadership the organization nearly doubled its membership and has extended its chapters into every section of the country. The NAACP has touched and influenced the life of nearly every young leader in the black American community today. Mr. Wilkins himself became active in the black community as a young man. After a childhood in St: Paul and graduating from the University of Minnesota. he became managing editor of a black newspaper where his racial awareness was raised and sharpened by his many experiences with injustice and intolerance toward the black community. These experiences led him to join the NAACP where he worked himself into the position of executive secretary in Under his leadership the NAACP proved itself a bulwark to the black movement in some turbulent years in American history. After the historic 1954 Supreme Court school desegregation decision. NAACP lawyers pressed forward with cases and legislation at every opportunity including the difficult 1960s. Through his patience. tolerance. and quiet perseverance Mr. Wilkins has demonstrated a faith in the American system. through which he has worked to move toward freedom and equality for all people. His is a faith which some do not share. Mr. Wilkins has announced his retirement from the NAACP at the end of this year. He steps down to make way for a younger leader. All Americans have benefited and live in a better country because of his careful work and his devotion to civil rights.

One of the objections which leveled against ratification of the convention is that it will mandate our Nation to seek out actively. punish. and prevent genocide whenever and wherever it may occur. The fear that we will embark upon a program to police the world is entirely unwarrantedthe Genocide Convention commits us to no such course of action. The United States will have no more and no less of an obligation than any other signator to fight genocide. Article VI of the convention clearly places the burden of responsibility for combating genocide on the state inhabited by the group against which genocide is perpetrated. Since no international penal tribunal exists presently. persons charged with genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article III shall be tried by a competent tribunal of the State in the territory of which the act was committed. This provision is proper. since the nation in question would logically have the greatest interest in the welfare of its citizenry. If other nations question the sincerity of any state in the \"interpretation. application. or fulfilment of the present convention.\" then these \"disputes shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice.\" in accordance with article IX. Only the nation in which the crime occurs is obligated to take action under the convention. The Genocide Convention will not necessitate American interventionism in the foreign arena. It would be a grave error to allow imaginary fears to distract us from the real intent of the Genocide Convention. We still have a moral obligation to defend human rights worldwide. Ratification of the convention is an essential step in the fulfilment of that obligation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Washington Post of January 20 contained an article by Mr. R. James Woolsey. \"Igniting the Defense Debate.\" which I strongly urge my colleagues to read thoughtfully. Mr. Wooiseys excellent and thoughtprovoking essay offers useful criticism of both the Congress and the Department of Defense. He notes in particular the need for new thinking in both bodies--: a need that has become painfully obvious to me in the. time since I joined - the Armed Services Committee. One example Mr. Woolsey offers of thinking that is not new is particularly pertinent to the fiscal year 1977 defense budget: the strike cruiser. He states that. \"Organizations and individuals whose careers are built on the successes of the past can have the same deadening effect on combat improvements that battleship admirals and cavalry generals had a halfcentury ago.\" For example. last summer. over the objections of his nowfired Secretary of Defense Schlesinger. the President worked together with parts of the Navy and some in Congress to obtain funding for a strike cruiser. the latest in a line of large nuclearpowered surface vessels. A Navy composed of such expensive ships would necessarily be small. raising serious problems of overall force vulnerability. Recent technological advances do make conceivable a Navy less vulnerable and more effective. if greater emphasis were placed on such items as tactical cruise missiles and vertical takeoff aircraft. on a larger role for nuclear submarines. and on a force of more numerous. smaller. and faster ships. including air cushion and hydrofoil concepts. In sum. this article is one of the best I have read from any source on the whole defense issue we face today. It is primarily. in my opinion. an issue of ideas. the Soviets have not so much outspent us as they have. in too many areas. outthought us. Mr. Woolsey focuses on that central problem. and I hope my colleagues will take the time to read what he has written on it. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD.",

It was under his tutelage that I acquired 90 percent of the knowledge of taxes that I possess today. Accompanying his brilliance and profound understanding of the law was a patience and a willingness to let each member of the committee be heard. He never let his superior knowledge shut out the voices of those less knowledgeable. Action taken by the committee under his leadership always represented a consensus of the members. Each issue received a full and unbiased airing before a decision was reached. His particular genius was in getting the diverse views of all the committee members to converge on a decision. Once the committee had expressed its will. Chairman MILLS would employ his full authority in implementing it. Legislation arriving on the floor always carried a special weight when WLPUR MILLS was its advocate. His thorough understanding of the legislative process combined with his substantial knowledge almost assured House passage of any bill he brought to the floor. He made the process of getting legislation approved look easy. What was not evident to observers was the painstaking effort on his part that preceded the committees final action. It Was WILBUR MILLS who was the guiding spirit in obtaining a committee consensus. After that. the rest was easy.",

On each occasion that he stood to speak either in the well of the House or at the majority table. a hush would fall over the Chamber without the need of the Speaker to use his gavel. WILBUR MILLS took the most complicated tax legislation and made it understandable to everyone listening.

I came not only to respect him but also to have an enormous personal affection for him. When he suffered personal trauma which shook both him and the country. along with every Member of Congress.

One of his greatest. in my view. was his leadership on the Kennedy tax cuts which reduced the barriers to investment and employment and got the American economy moving in the early 1960s. Many people then. as now. could not understand that removing tax barriers to economic activity would allow the productivity of the American economy to rise. and with the great expansion of economic activity would come higher tax revenues to the Government in spite of the reductions in the tax rates. As chairman of Ways and Means WILBUR MILLS had a remarkable grasp of the impact of tax measures on the productivity and rate of growth of the economy. As the Wall Street Journal put it in their September 23 issue: In 1962. President Kennedy wanted to fulfill his campaign pledge to get the country moving again. Representative Wilbur Mills. then chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. recalls that he. Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon and the President were aware of what Mellon had done in the 1920s. The idea of stimulating the economy through deficit spending was rejected and a taxcutting program ordered up. By way of introducing the Kennedy tax program. which sharply reduced personal and business tax rates. Mr. Mills explicitly argued that the lower rates would mean higher revenues. WILBUR MILLS had to battle the Treasury which then. as now. would not admit that a lowering of rates would expand the tax base and produce revenue gains. However. WILBUR MILLS leadership prevailed. and the Nation benefited greatly and for the record. tax revenues increased substantially. Today when the American economy is again stifled by high tax rates. it is time to again cut the tax rates and get America on the move again. WILBUR MILLS -taught the Congress that tax measures impact on the economy just as monetary and fiscal policies do. No greater honor could be paid to WILBUR MILLS than the great benefits that would flow to the American people if the Congress today would reaffirm the principle he laid down in 1962 and 1964 and reduce the tax rates on work and investment. I salute WILBUR MILLS on his distinguished record of service and wish him and his wife all the best.",

The oil depletion allowance has been kept in by the powerful oil companies which have had far too much to do with both political parties. I think the people of our country are fed up with this.

The basic issue that this House will decide today is where the power in this country belongs. and whether it belongs to the people who work and the people who pay their taxes. or whether or not it belongs to the special few.

Certainly. this would be most disastrous. especially in this time of economic crisis and high unemployment. Failure to enact the Wilson amendment would add fire to the economic problems we presently face. The majority of the exploratory drillIng in this country is done by the independent producers. By eliminating the depletion allowance available to the independents. we would seriously jeopardize this segment of our society. It would be difficult. if not impossible. for the independents to raise the necessary operating capital without the depletion allowance because of the high risk involved in drilling a well. It would seem to me that failure to enact the Wilson amendment would serve to increase the fortunes of the major oil companies. It would be more profitable for the independents to sell out to the major oil companies rather than to stay in business. thus eliminating any competition for the major oil companies. We certainly do not need this. I urge all my colleagues to seriously consider this matter. and vote in favor of the Wilson amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment of the gentlemen from Texas which will have the effect of permitting small oil producers to remain in business while continuing to encourage domestic production. Looking at the simple facts and figures. the benefits of this proposal far outweigh the costs. .Major oil companies control about 80 percent of the oil and gas production in the United States. However. it is the several thousand small independent producers who drill approximately 80 percent of the exploratory wells in search of new oil and gas supplies and consequently make about 80 percent of the new domestic discoveries. If we are ever to achieve energy independence. it is domestic exploration upon which we must concentrate. The major oil companies tend to spend much of their time in offshore drilling and in developing the oil and gas resources of foreign countries. It was precisely our development of the oil resources of other countries that has brought us into our present state of dependency. It is estimated that if we do eliminate the oil depletion allowance for all companies. we will gain $3 billion in revenue. However. if we take action now to exempt the small independents and wildcatters. it will cost us only $468 million of the $3 billion. I do not believe that this is an excessive price to pay for providing the incentives and possibilities for investment and enterprise by small businesses whose discoveries ultimately benefit the country as a whole. We can simply not afford to create a situation which would make it unprofitable for small producers to continue exploration and production. To do so would leave us totally at the mercy of the major oil companies whose policies have already proven too costly to the American public.",

Mr. Chairman. perhaps there axe those in the House who feel that too many Texans are injecting themselves into the argument over the depletion allowance -and that we may be doing injury to our cause. I would hope not. The people of the United States have been well served for many years by Texas oil and gas. Without that production. the Nation would be infinitely poor. Texans have the right to be proud of the contribution which our State has made and is making in providing oil and gas for the consumers of the Nation. In its truest sense. the issue before us is uncomplicated. The issue before us is this: Do we want more oil and gas for transportation. for home and for industry? If we do. we must resist the Green amendment which would remove the depletion allowance and do great violence to the independent producers who are doing a magnificent job in drilling exploratory wells and helping move us toward less dependence on foreign sources of energy. Repealing the depletion allowance will mean a slowdown in the momentum of the independents who are responsible for drilling the great majority of the exploratory wells and finding the additional sources of energy. The question is a simple one. If we want more fuel for our cars. industries. and homes. we must vote against the Green amendment which repeals the depletion allowance and for the Wilson amendment which preserves the depletion allowance for the independent operators. The Archer amendment is also in the public interest and I strongly support it. Let me strongly urge the defeat of the Green amendment.",

I merely want to point out that most of the arguments made against the Wilson amendment simply do not recognize the fact that all potential escapes have been taken out of this amendment. As far as I know. not a single member on the Committee on Rules challenged that point when I made myself available to it to answer any contentions to the contrary. For instance. the statement that oil companies would decrease their production in order to get into the 3.000 barrel exemption is utterly without foundation. because the 3.000 barrel exemption is for the first 3.000 barrels produced by an oil company other than a major. there is no way to reduce production and gain any benefit. It seems to me those opposed to the Wilson amendment argue against it in a most peculiar way. They say the amendment is too long. Most of the length of the amendment is to make it absolutely certain that the amendment is not subject to an escape or to a proliferation of the 3.000barrel exemption.",

Congress. you rejected President Fords tax package. You said you had a better plan. You said a $16 billion tax cut was not enough. You said the economy needed at least $21 billion to get it going again. You said we needed that injection as soon as possible. Now youre playing games. Youve got enough support to pass your expanded tax cut bill without delay. yet In a test of power. you have decided to attach an amendment... one you know will mean a filibuster. Many legislators who would support the tax bill wont support it with the depletion amendment. That amendment means a filibuster filibuster means delay and delay means Americans will have to wait even longer for tax cuts and rebates. Congressman Green. this is your amendment. All those speeches about the dismal state of the economy and what must be done wont mean a thing if your amendment delays passage of the tax bill even one day. Drop the amendment. get the tax bill through Congress now and worry about depletion allowances later. Americans are not in the mood for power plays. The Green amendment should be defeated.",

There are many Members here who were not here when I appeared on the floor. so I would like to read a letter which I quoted in my remarks from Mr. George Meany. president of the AFLCIO: DEAR CONGRESSMAN: We in the AFLCIO are deeply concerned at reports that an amendment repealing the oil depletion allowance will be attached to the tax cut measure on the floor of the House. We are completely opposed to the oil depletion allowance but we consider such an amendment now would be a serious mistake. The tax cut package approved by the Ways and Means Committee is a substantial improvement upon President Fords proposal. The Committee bill would increase the buying power of low- and middleincome families. thus greatly stimulating the economy. That stimulus is of overriding importance. To provide its greatest benefit to the economy. the tax rebate and cut must be passed as quickly as possible. Adding repeal of the oil depletion allowance to the Committee bill would almost certainly lead to a filibuster in the Senate and. thus. delay getting the tax cut into the hands of consumers.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I strongly oppose including in the tax rebate bill provisions to repeal the oil depletion allowance and to restructure our income tax rates for individuals. This Nation is now experiencing an increasingly severe recession. Rebating a portion of our 1974 taxes is clearly the quickest and most effective way of providing the American people with the additional spending power needed to stimulate the economy and check the recessionary slide. The success of the rebate. however. depends on its quick enactment. If the economic decline is allowed to continue unchecked. it will become harder and harder to turn it around. Inserting tax provisions unrelated to the rebate in the legislation before us today will inevitably result in unnecessary delays which will jeopardize the entire purpose and effect of the rebate. Personally. I favor both the phasing out of the depletion allowance and the easing of the tax rates for low- and middleincome individuals. I recognize. however. that these involve complex issues whose resolution will involve protracted debate. Clearly the Ways and Means Committee did not have the opportunity to adequately address these matters during its 3 days of hearings on the current tax proposals. And even though this body may vote on these questions today. their consideration by the other House will certainly take far more time than we can afford at the present juncture. We have a commitment from the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee that both energy taxes and comprehensive tax reform will receive priority consideration in the coming weeks. and that legislation in these areas will be reported to the full House later this session. While these are both matters which this Congress must resolve. there will be sufficient time during the next several months to accomplish this. We are rapidly running out of time. however. to enact a tax rebate that will be successful in stimulating the economy. For the sake of the Nation. let us set aside for now the issues of depletion allowances and tax rates.

Thus. this is different from a loan guarantee. rather we are permitting ERDA to enter into agreements with private industry that would be subject to congressional approval. It is apparent that our country is facing an energy crisis. We are relying more and more on foreign oil for our energy needs. We must start to \"think ahead\" and the only way we can do that is to develop alternative energy supplies. Nuclear fuel offer a needed alternative. It seems to fill the gap between now and the energy sources of the next century. We need to act now to help this industry that will benefit us all. off to a good start.

Let me refer the Members to page 291 of the hearings held by the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. which reads: Chairman PASTORE. Would you recapitulate on the question of the dead horse? Mr. KoMEs. The dead horse is a question that was raised in our reviews with the utilities where they said. \"Let us\"-or better yet the term that always is used is. \"what if\" the plant is completed and we have longterm contracts with UEA and you are depending on those contracts and the sales of s.w.us to develop the funds to pay off the debt. And on the day the plant is completed everybody marches in. They press the button to start the plant and it wont work. They say in that case we would have a dead horse on our hands because their contracts were guaranteed and they would be required to take or pay. That means that the private utilities with their contractor would be out of the SWU business. Said Mr. Komes. in conclusion. \"after they have built this plant. when they find that they have got a dead horse contract. that it means that it is a dead horse contract to the Government as well as to the people and. therefore. without those assurances.\" Further. Mr. Chairman. Senator BUCKLEY said: To make sure I understand. in other words the Government would be guaranteeing that the technology operates? Mr. Korsms. Yes. sir. Chairman PASTORE. And that is the only guarantee? Mr. KoMEs. That they will not be selling us a dead horse. If the horse is dead. it is yours. That is what we want to say. Hear that? Tell somebody else that this is not laboring the facts.",

A year does not go by that the dairy farmers and livestock ranchers in my district are not afflicted with excessive property damage and severe production losses resulting from natural disasters. This program has made it possible for these people who. for the most part. operate small family farms and ranches to get back on their feet and rebuild their property as well as their livelihood. The list of natural disasters which plagues the Redwood empire is neverending. Millions of dollars in homes. in farm and ranch property. and agricultural production are lost each year because mother nature takes her toll. and the path of destruction which is left affects each of the people who live in these areas as well as every American. We must insure a steady stream of agricultural products to the American public. and the emergency loan program provides the foundation for this vital \"insurance policy.\" Loans may be made for not only the actual loss sustained. but also for the credit which is needed by the farmer to continue his operations. And this provisionto allow funding for ongoing productionis imperative to maintain a viable agricultural economy throughout our country. Furthermore. the shortage of credit at this time places an extra burden on producers hit by disasters. It is difficult. if not impossible. for the small rancher or farmer to obtain credit from normal agricultural sources. and this measure greatly eases the financial vacuum that is created when a disaster strikes. In short. this legislation strengthens the guidelines under which the loan program is administered so that we are able to quickly respond to massive losses in agriculture production. and I urge each of you to support this worthwhile measure.",

Therefore. under the amendment that I am aware my colleague and good friend. the gentleman from Minnesota. is going to offer. which I intend to support to the best of my ability. this will take this problem into account.

This means that the farmer who has been wiped out. who is a small farmer. or a new farmer. and who needs about 4 or 5 years to recover his capital loss. will be helped by this act we are now considering.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on June 17. 1975. I introduced S. 1957. a bill to prohibit State taxation on the generation of electricity distributed in interstate commerce. The purpose of S. 1957 is to alleviate a specific situation confronting Arizona which could easily spread across the Nation. The specific situation to which I refer is New Mexicos recently enacted Electrical Energy Tax Act which became effective on July 1. 1975. This tax appears to apply both to electricity generated and consumed within New Mexico and electricity generated outside but consumed within New Mexico. However. due to tax credits available to New Mexico generators. this entire tax bill is paid by Arizonans. This is grossly inequitable. When the Finance Committee resumes consideration of H.R. 6860. the Energy Conservation and Conversion Act of 1975. I intend to offer the language of S. 1957 as an amendment thereto. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in this effort in order not only to rid Arizona of this unfair burden. but also to make certain the other States do hot follow New Mexicos lead. Mr. President. it is noteworthy that a New Mexico newspaper. the CurrentArgus of Carlsbad. N. Mex.. would carry a column in opposition to the New Mexico tax measure. Mr. Carl Turner. the author of the article. is executive manager of New Mexico Rural Electrification Cooperative Association. I believe the Turner article clearly points out the problems inherent in this recently enacted tax legislation. I would like to share Mr. Turners article with my colleagues.

Last year when RESPA was before the Senate. I supported the attempt to take away from the Department of Housing and Urban Development the authority to regulate settlement costs. That was our only opportunity for a record vote on RESPA. and those of us who recognized the terrible consequences that could flow to lenders and borrowers alike were not numerous enough. Today. others of this body are raising their voices to declare the need for legislation to modify or repeal this unwise legislation. I am particularly pleased that the distinguished chairman of the Banking. Housing and Urban Affairs Committee is scheduling hearings in the immediate future on this problem. I share the chairmans conclusion that RESPA is \"one piece of legislation that turned out to be something of a disaster.\" I congratulate him on his perception. Lenders throughout our country are deluged with the paperwork required by the RESPA regulations and as a result otherwise deserving loans are being unreasonably slowed. Loans that were routinely made in 3 days or less now must take 21 days. Loan officers must spend an hour or more on a loan closing that before RESPA only took 10 minutes. Far from saving the borrower money as was the intent of RESPA. these delays and burdensome procedures increase costs which must be passed on to the consumer. These regulations are a good example of the need for regulatory reform advocated by President Ford. It is apparent that the newness of regulations or agencies should not excuse them from close scrutiny as to their wisdom and usefulness. I am particularly concerned that small banks and lenders may find these procedures so difficult that they will go out of the real estate business altogether. At a time when we are all striving to improve the economic conditions in our country. such losses can seriously hamper or efforts. especially in the construction industry. Mr. President. I have received a letter from Mr. William A. Fitzgerald. president of Commercial Federal Savings & Loan Association in Omaha. Nebr.. which highlights his experience with RESPA.

The aim of the agreement reached yesterday is to begin to develop a SovietAmerican commercial relationship in the field of wheat and feed grain commerce which could be based on a longterm agreement. Any such agreement could include not only minimum purchases but the exchange of vitally needed agricultural information which is not currently available. thereby adding uncertainty and volatility to the problem. At long last. the White House is coming to grips with the difficult issues presented by the large Russian purchases. The sending of American officials to the Soviet Union to begin discussions is a positive sign. The creation of a food committee within the structure of the National Security Council is badly needed in view of our past inability to evaluate the economic and foreign policy impact of the Russian purchases. Mr. Meany has said to the President and to the American people that before further sales are made to the Soviet Union we should assess the economic and foreign policy consequences of our actionsthat we must \"Stop. Look and Listen.\" I am hopeful that we are at last moving toward the development of a food export policy which will be in the best interest of both producers and consumers. I must add that as part of this new initiative. I believe that the President and the Secretary of Agriculture must recognize the need for the creation of a national grain reserve which would work as an integral part of a new export policy. We need a natural food policy that goes beyond just selling. We must provide for our national needs and our export sales.",

The fact is that. prior to 19S61. there was no requirement that any of the ammunition manufacturers actually provide any kind of label on any of the ammunition.

I am surprised at the action of the majority leadership in attempting to call up the House version of the extension to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. As you know. during most of yesterday and today the Senate Judiciary Committee considered its version of the Voting Rights Act. and shortly after noon approved an extension of the act with very few amendments. I like to believe that the Congress is a deliberative body. that we operate under the committee system in which proposals are first considered in committee and debated by small groups of Senators with a degree of expertise in a particular fieldall of us in the Committee on the Judiciary being lawyers. Calling up the House bill on the same day the committee acted makes a mockery of the committee system. In my opinion it is a substitute for the orderly procedure which should prevail in the Senate. We have not had time to have the committee report printedin fact. to the best of my knowledge. not even to have the proceeding before the committee held yesterday and today transcribed. The committee agreed to file its report with the Senate. including minority views. not later than Tuesday midnight July 22. This seems to be a reasonable method of procedure. I realize. of course. that the leadership has responsibilities. but I wonder if the same procedure would have been followed if the chairman of the full committee. the Senator from Mississippi",

I would commend our distinguished majority leadership for the respect he has shown to the individual Senators in the past. I have often heard him mention. as he did today. that we are equal Members of a body in which the rights of each individual Senator are honored and respected. Procedure like that proposed to be taken today raises the question as to whether some are more equal than others. Even though the action contemplated to be taken may be possible. it appears to be a ruthless procedure. certainly one that I would not contemplate to be taken without any notice to those of us who have worked in the committee for the past 2 days attempting to agree on a bill which could be reported to the Senate and under which sufficient time remains for orderly consideration by this body.

TORBERT MACDONALDS service in the U.S. Congress spans a period of nearly 22 years. During that time. he made many contributions to this body and to the people of his district. establishing for himself a reputation as an able and effective legislator. and a worthwhile servant of his constituency. As chairman of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Subcommittee on Communications. Congressman MACDONALD was actively dedicated to the principle that the public airways should be used in the public interest. and he worked diligently to advance legislation reflecting this principle. His contributions to this and other areas of legislation In which he held firm convictions will be remembered by the Members of the Congress for some time to come. The people of TORBERT MACDONALDS Massachusetts congressional district first elected him to the House of Representatives in 1954. In recognition of his honorable and energetic service in their behalf. they sent him back to Washington as their Representative in 10 congressional elections thereafter. For Congressman MACDONALD. this in itself is a tribute as well as an expression of confidence.

Throughout this period. TORBY worked diligently for legislation he considered necessary for the improvement of living standards of his constituents. TORBY MACDONALD led the way in many legislative fights over the years. He never avoided issues but faced them squarely and honestly.

Major features of our bill include: A standard deduction of $135 per month. A deduction for all mandatory payroll deductions and for major medical expenses. An adjusted deduction for regional differences in housing and utility costs. An index standard deduction for CPI changes every 6 months. An extra deduction of $30 per month for a household with an employed person. and $25 per month for a household with an elderly person. An upper net income eligibility of $8.436 for a family of four with no earned income and $8.796 for a family of four with earned income. and The elimination of the purchase requirement and a benefit reduction ratio of 25 percent. This legislation is unique in that it rewards those families attempting to help themselves by remaining in the work force. while it recognizes the need for elimination of abuses and for more efficient administration of the program. I would like to take this opportunity to correct the RECORD regarding a vote taken last year on food stamps. During consideration of the fiscal year 1976 supplemental appropriations bill. Congressman PAUL FINDLEY offered an amendment to restrict eligibility for food funds in the bill to those families whose aggregate household income was within the poverty level as set by OMB. At that time. I inadvertently voted in favor of Congressman FINDLEYS amendment. This affirmative vote was a gross error on my part. I hope that the legislation I have introduced with Congressman KOCH will clarify my position on food stamp reform.",

Second. An allegation contained in a news article that appeared in the New York Times of February 22 that for political reasons.

A \"classified\" stamp which keeps press and people in ignorance is as great a blow to democracy. and must be viewed by this body as an offense as great. as the release of legitimately classified information. It is in this total framework that the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. and ultimately this body. must judge the issues raised by CBS Correspondent Daniel SchorTs release to the Village Voice of the House Select Intelligence Committee report. The legitimate right of Goverment to classify information within clearly defined guidelines is at issue here as well as national security versus freedom of the press and I hope the committee and the House will clearly delineate and thoroughly discuss both issues as we enter upon what could be one of the great debates in the history of our Bill of Rights and the freedom of the press.",

Today I should like to call attention to one of those people. who for four decades has distinguished himself as a leader in an industry essential to the economic and social progress of the United States. Next month Russell Craytor will be here in Washington to make his last appearance as president of the Optical Manufacturers Association. He is well known for his leadership and untiring service on behalf of the optical industry. especially through the association. and his retirement from the top post in that organization will challenge the industrys leaders to provide a helmsman of Russ Craytors caliber. But this year also marks the capstone in Russ Craytors professional career. which has extended for 41 yearsall with one of the industry giants and leading influences in Rochester. Bausch & Lomb. He will enter on a welldeserved retirement from the daytoday activity of the optical business world. leaving behind the distinctive mark of long. loyal. and conscienticus service which has benefitted not only his company and industry. but the general public as well. Ever since leaving the University of Rochesters Institute of Optics in 1935. Russ Craytor has devoted himself to mastering many of the challenges in ophthalmic sales. marketing. and professional relations. He will leave Bausch & Lomb as vice president for professional relations in the Ophthalmic and Consumer Products Division. but only after making significant contributions in many areas. including operations of the companys network of prescription laboratories. in customer. professional. and educational communications. and sales of its leading products. among them RayBan sun glasses. The industry will miss Russ Craytors active involvement. but his contributions will stand always as a reflection of the dedication of purpose with which he has approached every challenge in his 41 years with Bausch & Lomb.",

I would like to take this opportunity to recognize one of the most progressive and viable organizations providing services to the Spanishspeaking community. In addition. the Bicentennial will be giving recognition andl commemoration to the many veterans. both living and dead. who so unselfishly gave of their time. their efforts. and. in so many cases. their lives to maintain freedom In America. One of the most representative organizations of veterans and particularly of Spanish American veterans. is the American G.I. Forum of the United States. In its some 28 years of existence. the Forum has strived to protect the rights of the Spanish speaking. Antonio G. Morales is the current national chairman of the American G.I. Forum. Mr. Morales action as the chairman of this organization has seen him vigorously championing the rights of veterans of not only the Spanish speaking community. but of all veterans regardless of race. creed. or nationality. It is to him and to the American G.I. Forum that I extend my gratitude for establishing an agency that has become an integral part of the veteran community in the greater San Jose area. In this past calendar year of 1975. the American G.I. Forum. Veterans Outreach Program of San Jose. has assisted some 500 veterans in receiving over one million dollars in benefits from the Veterans Administration. In addition to this. the veterans outreach program assisted and placed some two hundred veterans in fulltime employment. It is this example that should be followed in providing services to veterans. We all are aware of the great many injustices that have occurred to veterans in the past. especially to those of Mexican descent. However. with the positive approach demonstrated by Mr. Morales and the American G.I. Forum. we can better realize the kind of dedication that has helped to make our country great. As part of its Bicentennial Year program. the city of San Jose has recognized the 16th Annual Coronation Ball of the San Jose American G.I. Forum as an official Bicentennial event. I join with the city in commending Antonio G. Morales and the San Jose American GI. Forum for their dedication and tireless efforts on behalf of our countrys Veterans.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the news from the Labor Department that the jobless rate declined in February to 7.6 percent is welcome. nevertheless the belief is widespread that the unemployment crisis will continue unless a fundamental shift in economic policy occurs in the direction of planning for full employment and production. There is ample reason for this view. By deliberately understating unemployment insofar as discouraged and underemployed workers are excluded from the official statistics. the Department of Labor has concealed the substantial joblessness that has existed during the past 20 years. Only in 2 years since 1954 has the unemployment rate among black Americans nationwide dropped below 7 percent. It has averaged 9 percent during the past decade. And the group hardest hit and likely to be permanently disabled by the lack of job skills are teenagers. particularly black teenagers. almost half of whom are out of work. We have created in our midst a permanent underclass whose members have little or no prospect of stable employment and income security for years to come. Where is the planning for new jobs. for training workers in new skills and technologies. for meeting new and expanding needs for goods and services? During the next 5 years. according to Chase Econometrics. we can expect at least 9 million new members of the labor force. but at the current rate of economic growth the creation of only 51/2 million new jobs. And about onehalf of the jobs that exist now will not exist 20 years from now. It is. therefore. not surprising that there is a gathering momentum in both Houses of Congress behind the HawkinsHumphrey Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act. A nationwide poll conducted by the New York Times and CBS News between February 2 and 8. shows that 70 percent of the American people believe \"the Federal Government should see to it that every person who wants to work has a job.\" And it is noteworthy that support for a full employment policy cover the spectrum of political opinion. I am. therefore. pleased to bring to the attention of my colleagues a commentary by Judd Arnett. the distinguished conservative columnist of the Detroit Free Press. on the issue of guaranteeing work to each and every American able and willing to work. I concur with Mr. Arnett that \"full employment is what this country needs more than anything else.\"",

I think the clear concern demonstrated by the European Community over DISC is the best indication of its important role in increasing U.S. exports from $44 billion in 1971 to over $107 billion in 1975. Let us remember. it was the Europeans who initiated the legal battle over DISC in Geneva. As Congressman KARTH has testified before the Finance Committee. the strong feelings of the Europeans regarding DISC are clear. In his testimony on March 29. 1976. Congressman KARTH stated: What the EC members and what members of other countries are worried about is the future of DISC holds such promises that U.S. businesses will greatly increase their efforts to export more and more of their production to our trading partners rather than exporting more of our jobs to these countries. I think our trading partners are the best judge of the effectiveness of DISC. and I think their actions are the best indication of whether we have an effective program in DISC or not.

It. in effect. incorporates the case law into existing statutory law. and would allow within a very limited area. already existing in the Law. the expenditure of certain treasury moneys. or corporate moneys. for the sole purpose of reaching either union members. or stockholders in the corporation ... (93 Record 43385). The case law to which I refer in the above quotation is typified by United States v. U.A.W.. 352 U.S. 567 (1957). Innumerable other references during the debate on November 30. 1971. made it clear that business entities were to be allowed to solicit their stockholders using corporate treasury funds in order to create parity with unions. who by reason of the Supreme Court decision in U.S. against UAW cited above. were allowed to solicit their membership using union treasury funds.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 49. Although it is only a small step.toward energy independence. it is. the first step Congress will have taken to directly increase the supply of domestic crude oil. This conference report is the result of many negotiating sessions. As a conferee. I know that neither the House. nor the Senate got all it wanted. but this final agreement is a good compromise. I can advise you it has the administrations support. Briefly. this conference report. Would leave control of the petroleum.reserves 1. 2. and 3 with the Secretary of the Navy. The Secretary would be required to bring the three reserves into productiofi within 90 days at the niaximum efficient rate for 6 years. with ienewable 3year extensions being permitted thereafter. At. his discretion. the Secretary is urged to: make sales of petroleum from the. three reserves . to- the highest. qualified. bidder for not more. than .1 year.:.Equal opportunity is given to all companies. and no one company can purchase more than 20 percent from the estimated Federal share of petroleum from the Elk Hills Reserve. Small refiners are protected as the Secretary is to reserve up to 25 percent of the estimated Federal share for sale to them. This setaside for small refiners may be prorated. The Navys jurisdiction over reserve No. 4 would be abolished. This Alaskan Reserve is transferred to the Secretary of the Interior. No development of this area would be allowed. pending completion of exploration studies and further congressional authorization. An important part of the bill requires the Secretary to have available within 3 years adequate pipeline capacity to accommodate at least 350.000 barrels of petroleum per day from the Elk Hills Reserve. There are also provisions for antitrust protection. common carrier status. a strategic reserve. a special account for the proceeds of sales. and congressional oversight. Mr. Speaker. passage of this conference will make available at least 350.000 barrels of petroleum per day for civilian consumption. When compared with our national daily consumption of 17.8 million barrels per day. it is a drop in the bucket. But it is a first stepand we should take it.

It is going on 3 years now since I joined with a number of my colleagues from California to secure release of the Navys surplus oil holdings in Elk Hills. At the time we started. southern California was experiencing severe shortages of oil from the Arab embargo. Although the situation has eased somewhat from that crucial time. the fact remains we are no less dependent upon foreign oil today than in 197374in fact. we are importing more than ever. The controversy over this bill has been long and difficult. but it did not ever involve the question of the publics right to share in the reserves they own. Rather .the dispute was over the method and safeguards to be applied to such development. That dispute has now been settled to the apparent satisfaction of the parties involved. This bill contains. as it should. safeguards against control of the supply by any one company. It guarantees small and independent oil companies access to the reserves. And it guarantees that oil will flow. In fact. within 90 days of enactment. the first barrels will be produced. eventually reaching as much as 350.000 barrels a day. or the equivalent of several tanker loads a day which will not have to be imported from overseas. I will not take up the time of the House any longer in discussing the implications of such an event. It is apparent that the benefits will be many. A better balance of payments. less dependence on a foreign cartel. and lower prices at the pump for motorists in southern California.

Domestic production of this domestic oil is a significant step that this Congress can take toward energy selfsufficiency for the United States. I might point out to my colleagues that. among other provisions of the bill. no more than 20 percent of the Federal share of petroleum produced from Elk Hills can be acquired by a single buyer. In addition. the Secretary has the authority to set aside up to 25 percent of the estimated Federal production for small refiners not having an adequate supply of petroleum of their own. Mr. Speaker.

As is well known. the controversy on abortion has led to much discussion over the question of at what stage of its life shall an unborn child become entitled to the constitutional light to live. In January. 1973. the Supreme Court ruled on the powers of a State. by Its laws. to constitutionally forbid abortion. The court said in effect that this Is legally correct only in the final 3 months of pregnancy. The Court. of course. was ruling on the constitutionality of State laws. and not on moral issues. It was a matter of jurisprudence. and not what is right and what is wrong from an ethical or moral view. I think the Supreme Court decision is in grave order. and strikes at the foundation of the human family which is the bedrock of our civilization. Mr. President. it having been held that the Constitution is unclear as to the right of an unborn child to life. then a constitutional amendment is necessary. A person is alive or is not. and an unborn child is alive or is not regardless of its age. This proposed constitutional amendment meets that point squarely. Anything short of this would be inadequate and unacceptable. I strongly support Senate Joint Resolution No. 178 and advocate its immediate passage.",

I believe that we in the Senate owe these citizens a straight up or down vote on the merits of the issue. I have taken the position. after careful study. that the proper unit of Government for the consideration of the abortion issue should be the State legislatures. Under our legal system. family and related criminal laws have traditionally been State matters. The controlling Supreme Court decision is unfortunate and leaves more questions unanswered than answered. but I do not believe that the language in this amendment is the proper vehicle for correcting the problem. While the Supreme Court outlines general guidelines with regard to the abortion issue. specific interpretations of the decision have yet to be tested in the courts. In fact. several State abortion laws are currently under active consideration by the Court. My own State of Ohio has passed a new statute which will hopefully have the effect of applying strict standards to doctors. clinics and hospitals that perform such operations. This seems to me to be a sounder approach than the proposed amendment before us today. I believe that the proposed amendment would be divisive among Americans of varying faiths and convictions and damaging to the spirit of religious tolerance that we seek.

I am confident that the Congress has just begun to deal with this issue. even though it has spent a number of months engaged in hearings on abortion since the fateful Supreme Court decision of January 1973. I intend to vote against the motion to table the motion to proceed with the deliberation of Senate Joint Resolution 178. the Helms resolution. I am doing this in order that the Senate might proceed to deal with the substance of the abortion question and the actual merits of referring an amendment to the State legislatures. My vote does not indicate satisfaction with the language of the Helms resolution. for I share misgivings of a number of my colleagues about this particular resolution. If the opportunity had been given I was prepared to support a substitute amendment which would assure that abortions would be allowed to save the life of a mother. I had also talked with some of my colleagues about language which would substitute the moment of implantation for the momcnt of fertilization as the point at which pritection would be given to the unborn. If these modifications had not been accepted I would also have supported versions which would at least refer the question to the State legislatures of allowing these State legislatures to subsequently make laws restricting abortion. Whatever the outcome of this vote. I think it is important to remember that it is a vote strictly on the question of proceeding to consider the Helms resolution. A defeat of this effort is not the final chapter on the abortion question. We are engaged in a longrange consideration of a matter of great consequence. The Congress. in this session or in subsequent sessions. may well want to give additional consideration to the substance of the matter.

It signals the end of grant military aid and U.S. military missions abroad except. may I add. as Congress may in its own judgment subsequently authorize grant aid or military missions on a countrybycountry basis. This provision has been long asked for in the Senate so that the Senate and Congress have a better picture of what is going on in- those overseas activities. It means farreaching changes in U.S. arms sales policy. giving Congress. for the first time. the right to review significant commercial sales of arms to foreign countries and expanding its tools for more effective oversight of all arms sales. And the emphasis on U.S. arms transfer policy will be shifted from indiscriminate selling to managing and controlling. The conference agreed to security assistance authorizations for the 1976 fiscal year totaling $3.17 billion. a reduction of $293 million from the House figure and an increase of $117 million over the amount that the Senate had originally authorized. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at this point a comparative table for the programs authorized in the bill.",

A $9 billion arms ceiling was not of our origin. nor was the provision in regard to the restrictions on the authority for trade with North and South Vietnam. These were House matters. We accepted them in a spirit of comity. and the House yielded many things to us. For the first time. we succeeded in getting into the conference report provisions. for examplc. terminating military grant assistance. It is a great step forward. It does not unduly in any way restrict the administration. the executive branch. It was worked out in cooperation with them. In truth. if the efforts that were made by both the executive branch. through the Department of State. the Department of Commerce. and AID. and the staffs of our committee and members of our committee are not going to produce cooperative action. then that is not possible. I do not accept that. I think we should vote overwhelmingly to approve the conference report. and I so recommend.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to question one particular aspect of the conference agreement concerning Chile. I am disturbed that the action of the Senate in regard to this amendment essentially was voided by the conference agreement permitting substantial amounts of continuing military aid to go to the Government of Chile. The Senate adopted my amendment on February 9. 1976. to put a complete halt to any transfer of arms to the Government of Chile. through Governmcnt or commercial channels. The Senate action went beyond previous law which had not affected commercial sales or the substantial pipeline of arms which currently exists. Unfortunately. the conferees on this matter adopted a compromise which is far closer to the House position than it is to our own. It still would prohibit grant or credit aid or training of Chilean military. but it would permit FMS cash sales and Government licensing of commercial sales. I intend to submit an amendment to the fiscal year 1977 legislation which I hope will be adopted. It will be identical to the language already adopted by the Senate to prohibit all forms of military support of Chile. Hopefully. this time it will prevail in conference. With regard to other provisions in the legislation. I express support for the strong stand of the conferees in assuring Israel the means to defend itself. Also. I believe the conferees have produced an admirable document. in other respects if a military aid program must be maintained. one which keeps faith with the new directions charted in the Senate versionin terms of assuring close monitoring of sales. adequate and timely information being made available to the Congress and most important. with a new institutional focus on human rights. No longer can an administration blithely commit U.S. taxpayer dollars and the advantage of arms. both manufactured and painted with the \"Made in U.S.A.\" signature. to regimes which engage in the grossest violations of human rights. We have now created a mechanism which will begin to insure that the State Department and the Defense Department consider the character of a regime April28. 1976 to which they propose to send military support. Such consideration is in keeping with international declarations of respect for human rights and our own 200yearold tradition. Both have been disregarded in the past too often.",

Second. I would like to say it seems we are discussing this legislation not only for legislative history but also for the Presidents enlightenment in trying to direct his attention one way or another on the legislation. Mr. Speaker. in the matter of legislative history. there was a previous dialog between the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentlemen from Ohio . In reference to one provision regarding discrimination. the gentleman from Ohio tried to clarify the legislativc history and the gentleman -from New Jersey. disagreed with the gentleman from Ohio In regard to what the House and the Senate did in respect to the socalled discrimination amendment. I would just point out. in reinforcing and quoting from the conference report: The conferees agreed to include the language of both the House bill and Senate amendment with the understanding that the House provision is to be given the meaning as expressed by the House and the Senate provision is to be given the meaning as expressed by the Senate. That is the way that issue was resolved and it is clear from the report language that that is the method in which it was resolved. Now. let us get into the question of the conference report itself and the legislation itself. *Discussion was made as to the intent of the legislation and the intent of the President to sign or not sign the bill. As one who has been involved in those discussions. it was my understanding that the President said he would veto H.R. 5900. unless it was accompanied by another bill that was suitable. This was reinforced by the gentleman from New York in the debate. when Secretary Dunlop was quoted as saying that unless that something he will work outmeaning the Secretary of Laborbetween management and labor. we would not have a compromise position.

Our postWorld War II experience with common situs picketing dramatically forecasts what will happen -again when this TaftHartley protection is repealed. Entire construction projects will be closed down. millions of manhours lost. Even unions will be significant losers if and when this bill becomes law. Many contractors may decide to avoid possible labor difficulties by using only nonunion subcontractors. costing the union workers their jobs. Including the Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Act as title II of the measure does not make it any more acceptable. The two are not even related. The proposed committee has no enforcement authority. making it almost worthless. Supporters of this legislation claim that it will provide \"equal treatment\" of craft and industrial workers. In fact. it permits these unions to conduct secondary boycotts although they are still unlawful in all other industries. H.R. 5900 adopts a double standard in business relationships. It lumps together separate construction employers as a single employer when it comes to picketing. But these employers are all treated independently when it comes to profits. losses. and taxes. I urge President Ford. as I have done previously in my letters to him. to veto this measure that will promote labor strife. not lessen it and will further cripple our goals of increased competition and productivity in the American economy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to express my support for the conference report on the common situs picketing bill. H.R. 5900. The conference report represents a substantial improvement over the original legislation. The conferees have exempted construction consisting of three residential levels or less. They have agreed to exempt small businessmen engaged in residential construction when the annual gross volume of that business is $9.500.000 or less. The conference has agreed to exempt construction begun within 1 year of the date or enactment and which is valued at less than $5 million. They have similarly grandfatheredin for 2 years all existing construction which is valued at more than $5 million. . Further. and this is a very important addition. the bill now provides for injunctive relief against picketing in breach of strikes and picketing in breach of contracts. In addition. the conference bill restricts common situs picketing to an employer that is primarily engaged in construction \"on the site\" of the construction. If the employer is primarily engaged in manufacturing or merchandising. onsite picketing of the construction is not permitted. Retained from the original House bill is the amending language which prohibits common situs picketing in three specific circumstances: First. When State laws require separate bids. Second. When the object is a product boycott. and Third. When the object Is to remove an employee because of membership or nonmembership in a union. Further. the legislation contains 10day notice requirements. a prohibition against striking because of sex. race. creed. color. or national origin. and a prohibition against common situs picketing where a nonAFLCIO union is working on the job. Private enterprise has an undeniable right to be treated fairly. The construction industry. if it is to regain its health and vitality. cannot become the pawn of either big labor or capricious or arbitrary local unions. The nonunion worker must have his freedom of choice equitably protected. He deserves nothing less. I believe this legislation accomplishes these things. while at the same time. it sensibly restores to the organized construction worker equality with his union colleagues. While no legislation is perfect. this legislation definitely balances the rights and interests of business. union. and nonunion working men and women. In its present form. I find it acceptable and will consequently support its passage..",

This hatchery is a key part of our overall effort to return anadromous fish to the Connecticut River Valley. An effort which will ultimately bring substantial economic benefits to the region as well as restore the historical environmental balance to the region.

Representatives ABZUG. BINGHAM. and I are reintroducing the bill in the amount of $200.000.000 along with 21 cosponsors. The events of the past week have reinforced my opinion that humanitarian assistance for the suffering victims of war in Indochina should be provided. under the auspices of international organizations and private agencies. to all those in need. The administration of relief aid by governments is ineffective when those governments are corrupt. or fighting for their lives. We have no more assurance that the Saigon Government will deliver relief assistance to people in need than that they will use American military supplies to fight rather than leaving them behind for the PRG. The Saigon Government is simply not trustworthy. Furthermore. the extent of human suffering reaches far beyond the enclaves still controlled by Saigon. There are millions of refugees in dire need of food. medicine. and shelter in areas now controlled by the Khmer Rouge and the PRG. Fortunately. there are several organizations that are already working to alleviate suffering in all areas of Indochina. These include UNICEF. the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. the International Red Cross. the American Friends Service Committee. and the Mennonites. These organizations are already in place and can make good use of the funds authorized by this legislation. I believe that the internationalization of humanitarian assistance is an idea whose time has come. I have been deeply disturbed by the tendency of this administration to use food aid for political purposes. instead of a means to reduce human suffering. If our purpose is to help those in need. it seems clear that we should give those funds to organizations which have established good records of Impartiality. competence. compassion. and efficiency.

Mr. Grill. trained in Red Cross first aid. was at work on last September 9 when a fellow employee suddenly became rigid and collapsed. Upon determining that the man had stopped breathing. Mr. Grill immediately removed an obstruction in the breathing passage and began artificial respiration. Several minutes later the victim started to breathe. but when he suffered a relapse. Mr. Grill readministered mouthtomouth respiration. Because of Gilbert Grills calm and courageous response to this emergency. the stricken man was able to be transported to the hospital where he successfully recovered from his heart attack. There is no question but that Mr. Grills valiant action saved this mans life.

Some things have not changed. though. and among them is the fact that the original plantation laborers. like Waipahus present residents. placed a high premium on good. basic education. Thus it was that only a year or two after the plantation was established at Waipahu that an elementary school was set up to accommodate some 125 youngsters from Waipahu and the surrounding communities some miles distant at Pearl City. Ewa. Nanakuli. and Waianae. That first school year. 18991900. these 125 young people were under the charge of just three teachers.

Waipahu Elementary School is now the oldest school in the Leeward District of Oahu. There are now nearly 1.000 students enrolled there. and the teaching and service staff totals about 70 people. The school has been joined over the years by other elementary schools in the same area. and Waipahu also has a high school to serve the growing community.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on March 10 of this year. the president of the National Small Business Association testified before the Finance Committee in the course of its consideration of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975. President Stewart made an excellent proposal in his statement. outlining a plan which could put up to a million people to productive work in business and not on government payrolls. Today. I am introducing legislation to implement that plan. The job creation tax credit plan would allow businesses to take a tax credit of 50 percent of the cost of up to two new employees. in newly created jobs. with a maximum credit of $20.000. One of the most attractive features of this plan is that it will not cost a cent unless a job is actually created. We do not have to guess at this plans effectiveness. If it does not work. it does not cost. This is a better idea than loading down government payrolls. It will also help many thousands of people learn useful jobs in businessjobs that will still be available when the economy can support them. No retraining will be required. for onthejob training will already have taken place. The investment tax credit does not reach many smaller businesses. but the job creation plan is actually designed to direct help not only to jobless people but also to small businesses. who are finding it hard to finance the expansion moves essential to economic recovery. I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the RECORD and referred to the appropriate committee. I also ask unanimous consent that articles from the Daily News of Palatka.

Other suggestions were for a cut in taxes on those several million firms which earn less than $25.000 per year. an increased investment credit up from the current 10 per cent to 20 per cent for manufacturers who are small by Small Business Administration standards. and incentive tax writeoffs for small businesses just getting started during this time of a soft national economy. All but the jobs part of the package is little more than whistling in the dark. Big business gets the breaks in Washington. Witness the futile efforts to eliminate the oildepletion allowance. But why shouldnt Congress take the NSBA jobs plan seriously? It would provide useful jobs in the private sector. which indeed could and probably would become permanent as the economy turns upward later this year. And what is important here is that the jobs would be useful. They would come from private firms contributing to the growth of the Gross National Product. not from the federal government trying to create jobs for the sake of creating jobs. And the type of jobs which the government will provide arent likely to be the productive type which boost the GNP. In addition. the NSBA proposal would become a training school for thousands. Those employed would be learning useful skills in a wide variety of occupations. Raising the skills of the employable so that they can go on to better jobs. increasing the GNP and the simple act of creating jobs are widely believed to be the remedy for recession.",

This legislation was a part of the Emergency Housing bill vetoed by President Ford yesterday. The housing bill had started out to be a measure to help prevent unemployed homeowners from losing their homes. but nearly $1 billion in questionable subsidies was added to the original bill during the floor debate. What began as a commendable effort ended up as an unjustifiable measure which would have imposed substantial costs on the American taxpayers. The final version of the bill is inflationary. ineffective and unfair to the majority of taxpayers who would have to pay the bill. and I support the Presidents veto. However. I do think it is important to act quickly on the provision of the bill to authorize loans to the unemployed to prevent mortgage foreclosures. Specifically. this legislation would allow people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own to seek Federal loans of up to $250 per month to avoid mortgage foreclosures on their home. These loans would have to be repaid. with interest. to the Government. and they would be made only to persons who would be able to fully resume their mortgage payments when the economy recovers. I think it is important for the Congress to provide relief in this area. The loan program will help the victims of the recession keep their most valued possession. while not increasing the burden on the American taxpayers. Mr. President.

Being a signer of the Rio Treaty. the U.S. Senate will have to consider any amendments recommended by this forthcoming OAS meeting. However. before this body considers any aspect of the OAS trade embargo on the Cuban Government. the Senator from Florida wants -each of his colleagues in Congress to bear in mind certain important facts regarding Castros treatment of political dissenters in Cuba. Although the human rights issue in Chile or Greece or Brazil has received much attention from Members of this body and from the news media. the same issue has often been ignored by many with respect to Cuba. Perhaps this was so because such groups as the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights of the OAS. Amnesty International. the International Red Cross. and the InterAmerican Press Association were themselves looking into this affair. On May 2. 1975. the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights of the OAS officially condemned the Cuban Government for violating \"the right to life. liberty. and personal security. to equality before the law. to a fair trial. of protection from arbitrary arrest and to due process before the law.\" It is indeed difficult to understand the OASs intention to consider the lifting of its trade embargo against Cuba. the same government which its Human Rights Commission has just denounced for violating mans most essential human rights. In view of the fact that the United States is a member of the OAS and that the OAS Human Rights Commission has just denounced the violation of human rights in Cuba.

I am pleased to bring to the attention of my Senate colleagues the superlative record of law enforcement that is being accomplished by the police department of Scottsdale in my home State of Arizona. Because of its superb training programs and its highly skilled force. the Scottsdale Police Department has earned a welldeserved reputation among the citizens of Scottsdale and law enforcement agencies in Arizona and throughout the country for providing lowcost maximum efficiency and effective police protection. Crime statistics are now so low in Scottsdale that the ration of the number of police officers to the citys population is one of the lowest in the Nation. One of the reasons for the Scottsdale law enforcement success story is the program of police assistants that the citys police department has been running for several years. which has been funded since 1971 by grants from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. This program has worked so well in Scottsdale. with considerable savings to the taxpayers. that it merits the consideration of my colleagues. I am inserting into the RECORD today a short article which was published in the Arizona Republic of April 27 as a part of a supplement entitled \"Crime and JusticeYou Are Involved.\" This article describes the police assistants program. which is now operating in Phoenix and other Arizona cities. Those Members who look skeptically on the LEAAs programs of assistance to local law enforcement agencies should consider the effectiveness of the police assistants program in Scottsdale. Ariz. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this article be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the debate on the proposed U.S. base expansion on Diego Garcia has been unfortunately and unnecessarily focused on the issue of reported Soviet missiles at Berbera. in Somalia. Reconnaissance photos have been displayed as If this were a replay of the Cuban missile crisis. But it is not. The Soviet missiles said to be in Berbera are the old Styx type. which have been given to more than a dozen nations. According to the best available public sources. this antiship missile became operational over 15 years ago1959has a limited range of only about 20 nautical miles. and carries only nonnuclear warheads. Even if a few have been sent to Berbera. they cannot be used until put aboard missile patrol boats. The Russians have spread these missiles all over in the pastto the navies of: Algeria. Bulgaria. China. Cuba. Egypt. East Germany. India. Indonesia. North Korea. Poland. Rumania. Syria. Yugoslavia. and Iraq. While any weapon in hostile hands should be of some concern to us. we do not need to build a new Navy base and start policing the Indian Ocean because of a few missiles at Berbera. In fact. the United States has its own array of antiship missiles. which can be fired from either ships or wideranging aircraft. These missile scare tactics by the Pentagon have blurred the real issue surrounding Diego Garcia. which is whether we want to have a naval arms race in the Indian Ocean. Despite repeated calls by the United Nations and the nations of the area. the United States has not approached the Soviet Union about mutual restraint In that area since 1971. Our diplomats have been Inactive. while the Navy has pushed ahead for this base. This military momentum for expansion is undercutting our foreign policy and is in arrogant disregard of the views of the countries along the Indian Ocean. I do not think the American people want to become deeply involved and militarily committed to the Indian Ocean. Nor do I believe they will pay the high price tag of up to $8 billion for a threeocean Navy. The sad fact is. that the Defense Department has wanted to have this base for nearly 20 years. and would want It now. regardless of any Soviet activity. The reported missiles are just the latest argument on a longplaying record.",

Mr. Chairman. we have had 13 Governors and their representatives come in and testify in the various hearings. and they have all indicated their support for this legislation on the basis of a tight money situation which compels them to temporarily seek aid from the Federal Government to cope with the massive onshore impacts of offshore oil and gas resource development. As I said in my opening statement on this legislation it is easy to imagine the feelings in rural counties faced for the first time with the prospect of dealing with the huge offshore oil industry--especially when the tax proceeds from this activity go entirely to the Federal Government. but the expense of providing services made necessary by the new industry Is borne by the local and State governments. When tax revenues generated by the new industrial activity are not enough to meet the public expenditures. commumities are faced with a new loss.

Mr. Chairman. I represent a coastal State and a coastal district. I represent the county of Santa Barbara where we had a disastrous oil spill in 1969. an event that attracted worldwide attention. Oil drilling. offshore oil drilling. and onshore facilities. are a matter of serious concern in that area. I might say also that my district is about evenly divided as to whether there should be offshore oil drilling or not. but most people in my district support this bill because this legislation does recognize the problem. While the bill may well admit or concede that there is going to be Federal offshore oil drillingand I think that Is probably a very logical assumptionit does also point out that the Federal Government does have an obligation to mitigate the problems that Its very activity might create. Mr. Chairman. this legislation is of particular importance to California because that is a State where there is probably going to be immediate Federal offshore oil drilling. The Department of the Interior. in spite of some protests. has gone ahead with offshore oil leasing. The legislation we have before us I think is necessary to offset the adverse economic. environmental. and social Impacts that might be caused by that particular operation.

They have done it by taking the situation on poultry and excluding them. taking rice and excluding it. and also saying to the oil and gas industry that it does not apply so long as controls exist. and that it does not apply to others. That is what they have done. But we have tried time and time again. They have offered their amendments and a number of them have been discussed at length. At some point.

We have had a great deal of publicity that has led the public to believe that the Senate Finance Committee has not really seriously moved on tax reform. We have. We have done a number of things with the minimum tax. We raised it from 10 to 15 percent. and that is an addon tax. not a tax just by itself. That is a 50percent increase in an addon tax. We took the $30.000 exemption. reduced to $5.000 of the taxes paid. whichever is higher. We took the excess of the itemized deductions. about 60 percent. and said they would be subject to the minimum tax. We took intangible drilling costs that were in excess of oil and gas income in the depreciation schedule and said they would be subject to the minimum tax. We took accelerated depreciation on leased property. or personal property. and said that would be subject to the minimum tax. So we spread it very substantially. I hope we have a chance to have that acted on. But. as the Senator has stated. they have used this device of coming back with an amendment. and an amendment to the amendment. to deny the Senate consideration of these very positive things that have been done by the Senate Finance Committee. With that in mind and with the understanding that if this carries they will later get a chance to vote again on these two amendments. I must move to table the amendment of the Senator from Maine.",

Normally. when you are talking about depreciation you are talking about depreciation on the basis or the cost of a piece of property. In this situation what we have done is restricted that to the amount at risk. and this is a revenueincreasing measure for the Treasury. It is a tightening up of the tax law. It is a closing down of a tax loophole. The committee amendment adds a provision that limits the deduction for certain investments to the amount for which the taxpayer is at risk and. generally. that will be the taxpayers equity. plus the amount on any loan on which he has a personal endorsement. This atrisk rule will be applied in the case of film purchases. oil and gas drilling. equipment leasing. and all farm operations. The atrisk rule is designed to restrict the benefits that are derived from leveraging the taxpayers investment through nonrecourse loans. This is what permits some individuals to claim substantial deductions when they put a very small amount of money into a deal. For example. the committee has seen examples of film purchases where taxpayers were able to deduct more than $4 for each $1 they actually invest in the film. That is the type of example the Senator from Colorado was dealing with earlier in the afternoon. This will no longer be possible with the atrisk rule proposed in the committee amendment. In 1977 this raises $52 million. in 1978 it raises $40 million. in 1979 it raises $35 million. in 1980. $36 million. and in 1981. $37 million.

This amendment. I might add. is approved by the National Livestock Tax Committee and by the American Horse Council. It is a technical amendment which fully preserves the recapture potential. and does not result in any revenue loss. Under present law. many reorganizations in which a corporation divides into two corporations are taxfree under the code. However. if a corporation has been required to establish an excess deductions accountEDAunder section 1251 because of farm losses. it can engage in a divisive reorganization without triggering recapture from its EDA account only if substantially all of the assets are transferred to the new company by the old company. Thus. even though a reorganization of this sort would otherwise be taxfree under the code. recapture under section 1251 may be forced upon a company which. for legitimate business reasons. wishes to divide into two companies and in which the farm recapture property is held by substantially the same owners as before. although in two corporations. rather than one. The amendment is designed. in general. to allow a corporation to divide into two corporations in an otherwise taxfree reorganization without triggering recapture from the excess deductions account. However. it is also designed so that if farm recapture assets are disposed of by either corporation surviving the reorganization. the amount of recapture under section 1251 will. as nearly as possible. be the same as it would have had there been no reorganization.",

The EDA account of each corporation will be reduced by farm net income of both corporations. computed on an aggregate basis. and by amounts recaptured by section 1251 with respect to both corporations. I understand that the Senator then put in a further proviso to be sure that there is not a legislative loophole created here. It is my understanding the Secretary of the Treasury is given discretion in establishing rules with respect to the manner in which reductions from the EDA accounts of corporations which have engaged in such a reorganization shall be made. In general. such reductions. with respect to each corporation. are to be made on an aggregate basis with the Secretary providing rules under which the farm net income and losses of both corporationsand other amounts which reduce EDAare combined. It is also anticipated that the Secretary will. if necessary. provide for the making available to a corporation such information of the other corporation as is required to compute amounts which are subject to recapture and amounts which reduce the excess deductions account of the corporation.

When talking about nonpartisan voter registration drives. especially as they are put on by corporations or by unions. they are nonpartisan only In the sense that they will register everybody in whatever party they want to register in. They become very partisan in the sense of where one conducts the registration drive. Anybody who has been in the business of politics for 3 months soon learns there are certain areas that are heavily supportive of ones candidates and some heavily opposed. In voter registration. one does the best he can to register them in the area they will support one. and ignore or give a very low priority to the area where voters will register and likely oppose one. More often by unions than by business. voter registration drives are conducted in areas that are likely to register overwhelmingly Democrat. There are some exceptions with other organizations and I compliment such organizations as the League of Women Voters. quite often the various junior chambers of commerce around the country. who do conduct what I consider genuine nonpartisan voter registration drives. But. by and large. unions or to a lesser extent. corporations. simply do not conduct them as openly. or too much toward the partisan voter to support their causes. I think if that is the case. if money is going to be spent to register voters. that we know 70. 80. 90 percent are going to support the candidate of ones choice. that that is. indeed. an expenditure toward the election of that candidate or that party and that money should be revealed.

In recent years we have. for example. learned a great deal more about the dangers of stratospheric pollution. which can degrade the ozone layer and expose us to deadly ultraviolet radiation. The Bi. like the SST. poses precisely that danger. In addition. as the Environmental Action statement points out: The Bi will produce a more powerful sonic boom than any other plane ever manufactured. Further. unlike the SST. the Bi and other aircraft armed with nuclear weapons raise concerns about the environmental hazards associated with nuclear accidents. No one has suggested that these environmental impacts make up the full case against going ahead with the Bi. But they must certainly be included in the equation. It would be another story if the Bi were the only thing standing between us and the ultimate pollution of nuclear war.

I would like to call attention with great pride to President Fords initiative among world leaders in recognizing the contributions and potential of women. The appointments of Carla Hills as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Betty Murphy as Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board are clear testimony that the President believes women deserve an equal place in government. I applaud him for his fairminded leadership. Mrs. Hills and Mrs. Murphy. both attorneys. have had distinguished professional careers. The ability they displayed in their past assignments is a harbinger of their future accomplishments which will benefit the country. President Ford made these appointments without pressure from womens groups and that is to his credit. I am pleased with the progress his administration is making in giving equal consideration to women for jobs at all levels of government. I look forward to the day when discrimination against women is entirely eliminated. Mrs. Hills has demonstrated the expertise needed to serve in the Presidents Cabinet. Her record as chief of the civil division of the Justice Department attests to this. Mrs. Murphy is a nationally recognized labor lawyer who has distinguished herself in her legal practice. Quality appointees. such as these women are. will demonstrate that sex is no barrier to government leadership. I extend my personal congratulations to both these fine women and wish them well in their new undertakings. Their record in office will provide us with additional ammunition to use in the effort to eliminate the inequities facing women. Mrs. Hills and Mrs. Murphy have sharp. probing minds. outstanding administrative ability. and the will to do a good job. The country will be better for their service.",

Mr. Chairman. the Committee on Appropriations is recommending that a grand total of $5.936.636.000 be provided for the emergency acceleration of existing Federal programs and projects in order to increase immediately employment throughout the Nation. The committee estimates that over 900.000 jobs will be directly provided by this bill. The bill contains $5.368.474.000 in new budget authority. $485.000.000 in loan authority. and $83.162.000 in liquidation of contract authority. Mr. Chairman. I will not cite all the bleak economic statistics that generated this bill. The country is facing a most difficult situation. Unemployment has soared in the last yearnearly 8.000.000 are out of work. the unemployment rate stands at 8.2 percent. and the prospects for recovery are dim indeed. It is our hope that H.R. 4481 can help stimulate the great resources that this Nation possesses and can be a part of the economic recovery for which we all look. In the last few weeks the committee. through its subcommittees. has mobilized an intensive effort to Identify existing programs and areas where additional funds would immediately create additional jobs. The committee has worked closely with the leadership of the House in developing this bill as a response to the critical unemployment situation facing the Nation. Seven subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee have developed this measure. The members of these subcommittees have worked many additional hours in putting the bill together. The work came on top of a schedule already crowded with regular appropriation bill hearings. development of a supplemental appropriation bill. and handling of the various rescissions and deferrals. These subcommittees are certainly to be commended. Two approaches to the unemployment problem are being recommendedfunding of programs such as public service jobs in which funds are used directly for the creation of jobs and funding of accelerated Government programs such as construction. repair and rehabilitation. and purchase programs where funds will be used to create jobs indirectly through construction contracts. purchase of automobiles for Government use. further development of the Nations recreational and public land resources. and other similar programs.",

There were deferrals amounting to $24 billion requested. All of these pending original deferrals have been released. to the extent of $15.6 billion which has been released.

I must raise a question as to what will be facing us down the road a ways. What will happen at the end of that particular time when these local communities and States. which have builtin Federal contributions to public service jobs. come back to us and then we have a renewal of the general revenue sharing bill? Then just watch all of the builtin lobbying that will be going on around the country. bringing pressure upon the Congress to vote $5. $6. or $7 billion for general revenue sharing. because they will say we must keep those people on that have been piled on us before.

I have seriously doubted the advisability of continuing the congressional investigations into the CIA and other segments of the Nations intelligence community. Now that CIA Director William E. Colby has been replaced and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has been relieved of his post as the Presidents National Security Advisor. I believe the time has come to call a halt to both the Senate and House intelligence investigations. As a member of the Senate investigating committee. I can attest to the fact that we are turning up no new material that would assist anyone in drafting legislation for a more effective and more ethical intelligence operation. In fact. I believe the congressional investigations into intelligence activities are now becoming counterproductive. I believe if they are allowed to continue indefinitely that they will do serious harm to this Nations intelligence activities and therefore to its security. Mr. President. in the Senates investigation most of our time has been expended in attempting to trace down longpast actions by the CIA aimed at the assassination of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and other foreign leaders. The information which has been uncovered is hazy and indecisive in many respects. I can say definitely that it in no way supports Senator CHURCHS contention that the CIA functioned in the uncontrolled fashion of a \"rogue elephant\" for many years of its existence. In conclusion. Mr. President. I believe that enough is enough. I believe we have given the congressional investigators all the time they should need to look into the operations of the intelligence communities in the hope of finding areas that could be corrected or improved through legislative action.

But today. when we have learned so much more about the great hazards inherent in atomic energy. it is not appropriate that we perpetuate the false economic environment of the PriceAnderson liability limit.

    "speech": "Mr. President. a major issue has arisen during consideration of proposed legislation that would create a 200mile limit off the American coast through unilateral action. The issue is that of enforcement. When the United States moves unilaterally. claiming sovereignty over the area within 200 miles of its coastline. the enforcement will be left to the military establishment. The Coast Guard. the Navy. and probably the other armed services as well. will be called on to enforce our claim. in light of the fact that no other nation will be supporting our contention. For this reason. I can only contemplate millions of dollars being spent by the United States alone. to maintain the national sovereignty of the unilateral 200mile zone. Another option exists. which is the International Law of the Sea Conference. As some recognize. the Conference is preciously close to completing its work and is within two or three sessions of sending delegates back to their respective countries to seek ratification of the Law of the Sea treaty. Contemplate the distinction. between the enforcement question as it relates to an International agreement. and compare that to the enforcement needs relative to unilateral action. Obviously. when all nations agree to a program. the enforcement program is an easier task compared to a situation where one country is in the position of physically enforcing an action it has chosen to take without the counsel or even acquiescence of other nations concerned. I present. in this context. an article written by a close friend and constituent from Anchorage. Alaska. Mr. Robert M. Goldberg. The article appeared in The Future of International Fisheries Management. published by the American Society of International Law. Mr. Goldberg is a distinguished member of the bar in the States of Illinois and Alaska and currently practices law in Anchorage.

They express apprehensions and deep concern about irresponsible fiscal policies that we have been and are still pursuing. They are becoming disillusioned with social programs that too often penalize thrift and reward indolence. They cannot understand Government programs that compensate unemploymentpay people who are not working and who are not willing to workwhen the jobs are available with pay above the minimum wage. They register with us many other valid complaints to which Congress has not yet been responsive. Mr. President. we had better heed these pleas of substantial citizens and take legislative action to rectify these untenable conditions before it is too late. Mr. President. typical of the letters to which I have referred is one I have just received from Mr. John E. Anthony of Bearden. Ark. The information it contains is factual. and his opinion are persuasive. I am in accord with most of the views he expresses. I think his letter will be of interest to my colleagues and to I. therefore. ask unanimous consent that Mr. Anthonys letter to me of October 31. 1975 be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I invite the attention of my colleagues to an article appearing in this mornings New York Times which reminds us once again that the most crucial issue facing this Nation today is jobs. Too often. I am afraid. the human dimension of the problems measured by graphs. tables. and numbers is overlooked. Martin Waldron. in his \"After 5 Months Without a Job. Hope Grows Dim.\" captures the frustration. anxiety. and discouragement of one man who lost his job last June and. despite his best efforts. has since been unable to find work. Mr. Alfred Prato. whose experience is the subject of the article. has concluded that \"nobody really cares\" about the millions who have lost their jobs during the past year. Mortgages are threatened. life and medical insurance policies are lost. diets are cut back. and the questions of children young but old enough to understand go unanswered by their fathers. As I have said repeatedly. unemployment today is our most serious national problem. More than 25 million Americans will experience the personal tragedy of being without work at one time or another this year. This Nation has never accepted joblessness of that magnitude. and it cannot now. For if we do. we doom ourselves to massive budget deficits. idle industrial capacity. and economic drift. And. most importantly. we doom millions of Americans and their families to prolonged anguish. suffering. and uncertainty. This Nation and its people certainly deserve better. I commend Mr. Waldron on his article and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD.",

I feel that it is imperative that the United States take a stand against such vile acts as murder. mental and physical harm. and mandatory sterilization of entire groups. In assenting to this document. the United States would prove that it is against such atrocities. Unfortunately. one cannot deny that these actions have occurred. Under Hitler. Jews. gypsies. and Slavs were mercilessly slaughtered. There were forced ingestions of drugs for the purpose of destroying minds. Both concentration and slave labor camps existed and it also is a fact that the Nazi and Czarist Russia regimes required sterilization of certain groups. The United States has an obligation to see that these actions do not recur. Being a heterogeneous nation in origins and beliefs. we must seek to ascertain that unpopular ethnic and religious groups of other countries are given their rights. It is our moral obligation to take a stand against these iniquitous crimes against people. The United States has had approximately 30 years in which to give their agreement to this document. For three decades. the United States has refused to take a stand concerning this devastation of peoples. Congress should come to terms with this issue and prove that the United CXXr2194Part 27 States is for the preservation of human rights for all people.",

That irritates farmers as much as anyone else. Let me suggest that if urban Members of Congress want to do more than posture about the growing gap between the price farmers receive and the prices housewives pay in the grocery store. they will support the dairy section of the farm bill and join me in supporting dramatic and even radical increases in funds for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to enable those two agencies to expand their investigation into and control of monopolistic and anticonsumer market practices.

Other Members have offered similar proposals. But no action has been taken by the committee to which these are assigned. I am sure the public did not realize what was happening in 1967 when Congress enacted the present backdoor pay increase system. a procedure under which the President recommends salary increase for judges. highlevel executives. and Members of Congress. and the raises go into effect automatically unless vetoed by the House or Senate. This means Members of Congress can avoid voting on their own pay increases. What a cynical procedure. Personally. I think this is the wrong time for a pay increase. most of our constituents are suffering real hardship from the Nations economic problems. Members of Congress should set an example of restraint and holding down unnecessary spending. The last thing we should do is raise our own pay. But it is not just the money that concerns me. There is an issue of principle involved that is more important than costwhether Congress will be forthright enough to require a vote on Members pay increases instead of waiting for an opportunity to let an increase go into effect without a vote. I think it is timeindeed. long past timeto reestablish procedures which require Members to vote on salary issues and put an end to backdoor raises. The same principle should apply to those allowances. such as the stationery account. which are really a form of salary to Members. These should be increased only after a vote by the full House. I can not see why we should fear such a procedure. If and when the time comes that Members salaries or allowances should be raised. I will not hesitate to vote to do so. And I am confident the people of my district will support such a decision if it is justified. But they will not support continuation of the present backdoor method of increasing pay and allowances. Nor do I. That is why I have joined in sponsoring legislation to require a vote by all Members of the House. I hope this bill will soon be enacted.",

In a way. it is most unfortunate. particularly in view of the current very serious balanceofpayments deficit. that this need for expansion is dramatized by a steel trade deficit of almost $500 million for January 1975. According to the American Iron and Steel InstituteImports in January were the highest ever for any January by a wide margin. They were 420.000 tons higher than the previous record for the month1.381.000 tons set In 1973. The 1.801.000 tons imported in January 1975 were also nearly one million tons higher than the steel import total for January 1974. Industry experts concede that domestic steelproducing capacity lags well behind the anticipated demands of a prime economy and that only present economic hard times have prevented a critical shortage. Accordingly. revival of both the automobile and housing industries could well mean even more foreign imports unless our domestic industry expands its capacity. Expansion of our domestic steel producing capacity will generate new jobs for American workers. reduce our dependence on foreign sources. and contribute to a reduction in our balanceofpayments deficit. All three of these are indispensable to the revival of the American economy. The challenge to the American steel industry is abundantly clear. Their response can only be \"full speed ahead on plant expansion.\" The article from the McKeesport Daily News follows:",

In the 15th Congressional District. there are still many such small enterprises. often run by families. who have few resources backing them up in case of emergencies or setbacks of one kind or another. Huge enterprises. backed by chain management and profits. can sustain virtually any damage and stay in business. Small. independent operators. such as still proliferate in Brooklyn. live in dread of the unexpected. One of the most devastating .blows to any small business is property condemnation as a result of Federal action or programs. In thousands of now familiar instances. a Federal program or even just a federally assisted undertaking will suddenly loom over an established neighborhood. Suddenly. Government officials appear in the area. visit the small businessmen and women in the immediate vicinity. and what they say spells the doom of their longestablished way of life. Many of these neighborhoods have been viable entities for generations. surviving and enjoying the strength lent them by small enterprise. To the neighborhood. a major project is at least a shock.

The Senator a minute ago said what is the alternative. indicating that we had no alternative. We do have an alternative. We have stated that in the law because it reads as follows: As Individual. for purposes of any regulation. becomes a candidate for nomination for election or election to federal office: 1. As of January 1st of the year in which any election is held in which he runs for nomination or election.... So. that is one of the tests as to when a man becomes a candidate and. therefore. the presumption Is that his expenditures at that time from that time forward would be political. 2. When he publicly announces that he is a candidate for nomination or election.. That means that he might publicly announce 6 months before. as the President has done now. and announce long before the election. therefore. he is a candidate and under the presumption will apply. 3. Has taken the action necessary under the law of a State to qualify himself for nomination for election. or election. to federal office ... That means that under that provision. he would have gone ahead and filed under the State law. when he could file. So there are three alternatives. The fourthand this is most importantthat he \"has received contributions or made expenditures. or has given his consent for any other person to receive contributions or make expenditures. with a view to bringing about his nomination for election. or election to such office.\" Those are the four alternatives.

It was therefore responding to the urgent need to establish guidelines in this area. The Commission has given assurances to the Committee on Rules that it will be issuing a similar regulation dealing with the President and the Vice President in the very near future.

Secretary KISSINGER. I think the statement is totally untrue. Admiral Zumwalt alleges that I made this statement on a train going to an ArmyNavy football game. Now. if anybody has even been on a train going to an ArmyNavy football game. you cannot imagine that a group of Admirals and advisors to the President sit together and discuss the relationship of Athens to Sparta and whether that is a particularly good audience to which to say the United States has passed its zenith.

    "speech": "Mr. President. Saturday. May 1. was a very special day for all Americans. because it marked the day upon which the average taxpayer ceased to work for the Government and began to provide for himself and his family. It was in a sense his day of fiscal Independence and as such should be declared a national holiday to provide a time when the average wage earner can reflect on the cost of a Government grown large and pervasive. Such a holiday could. of course. not be fixed as to any particular day since it moves forward as Government spending increases. In 1975. fiscal independence day would have been celebrated on April 30. Just think. in less than 65 years we will be able to celebrate both political and fiscal independence on the same day--July 4. Of course. if we count deficits in Government spending the true date of fiscal independence for us as a nation is July 15. 1 am not disposed. however. to quibble on that point. For those of us who find an annual day of recognition to be too infrequent. we can find satisfaction on a daily basis by noting that taxes at all levels consume 2 hours and 39 minutes of the average income produced in an 8hour day. It would. of course. be unfair to pose this issue in the context of Government taking money from beleaguered taxpayers. Government also gives. If we calculate Federal Government spending by functional category on a per household basis. we see that spending per household totals $5.285. That spending reflects the following priorities: Health and income security. $2.299 or 43 percent. National defense. $1.356 or 28 percent. Interest on Federal debt. 504 or 10 percent. The above three priorities utilize approximately 80 percent of outlay dollars. All other functions of Government absorb the remaining 20 percent. These are the priorities which characterize the fiscal year 1977 budget. I wonder how closely they reflect the priorities of the tax paying electorate. I ask unanimous consent that a chart entitled \"Estimated Federal Budget Outlays Per Household. by Function. Fiscal Year 1977.\" be printed in the RECORD.",

President Park Chung Hee instituted a tough new campaign of repression. The declaration that led to President Parks brutal reaction was a moderate appeal for a return to a democratic government in Korea. One key section of the statement declares: In the midst of our bitter struggle against the communist regime of the north. we should always maintain our democratic force in coping with the north. Without the backing of democratic force. national defense as well as economic power is like a house standing on the sand. The declaration was signed by some of South Koreas most esteemed former government officials and political leaders. including former Foreign Minister Chung II Hyung. former opposition leader Kim Dae Jung and leaders of the South Korean Christian community. The Park governments reaction was swift and stringent: Almost all of the dozen or so signers of the letter were arrested and questioned intensively. Some of the courageous group of signers are still in jail and some have been released. Many others have been arrested and 400 university professors have been dismissed or forced to resign. It is clear that President Park is determined to stamp out whatever remains of freedom in South Koreadespite the consequences in terms of maintaining support for the government within or outside the country. These bitter events in South Korea cannot go unnoticed in the United States. We still maintain 40.000 U.S. troops and a high degree of interest in a country where many Americans fought and died 25 years ago. I believe that past American support of South Korea has been",

Only one other racethe Monaco Grand Prixis held in the streets of a metropolitan area. Last falls highly successful Long Beach Formula 5.000 race served as a warmup for Sundays event. The 2 mile plus track received a lot of praise at that time from race officials and the drivers themselves. which has served to heighten the anticipation for this Sundays race. Street racing is never as fast as competition held on courses designed to serve as race tracks. However. the advantages of street racing include better action. a more interesting. varied track. and the excitement of running through the streets of a busy metropolitan area. Long Beach is known as \"The International City.\" and it will truly become one during the race. Almost one thousand members of the press are expected to be accommodated. and the Grand Prix will be reported in over a dozen languages to nations on every continent except Antarctica. The Long Beach Grand Prix may become the largest gathering of the international press in American sports history.

Mr. Speaker. Greek Independence Day must be a significant day for all peoples everywhere who love human freedom and cherish democratic political institutions. For we all know that the concept of democracy was spawned by the remarkable leaders and thinkers of ancient Greece and we realize as well that their teachings inspired the Founding Fathers of our own country as well as of other democratic nations.

I would here recall. Mr. Speaker. that in the year 1821. our own Republic was young and. therefore. the cause of Greek independence won the sympathies of many leaders of the United States.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I introduce for appropriate reference a bill designed to require that funds collected through socalled grazing fees be expended solely for range improvement purposes. except where otherwise specifically designated for payment to the State or Indian tribes. I believe the original intent of Congress is being subverted when these funds are used for extraneous purposes. We have heard a lot of nonsense about how the livestock producers are being given a free ride on Federal land and how the ranges are deteriorating from livestock grazing. At present. the rancher is the only individual who pays anything for range use and it is he who returns meat products to the Nation from a resource which is limited to very few purposes. Cattlemen object to the BLMs using range improvement money for purposes other than range improvement. Another problem is that under most circumstances. ranchers are not even permitted to use their own funds to make range improvements until recently ordered impact statements are completedwhich could mean a wait of up to 13 years in some areas. The rancher supports the multiple use concept for the public lands and is understandably mystified when his use of the range is somehow made to appear improper. Conversion of the limited forage of the ranges to animal protein is certainly one of its most efficient uses. This can be done. as it has for many years. without significant disruption of the wildlife and scenic values of the ranges. Mr. President. the question of range deterioration is one which has not been settled. in my opinion. People who have seen Nevada. for instance. know the ranges have never been a verdant splendor. But the ranchers have a tremendous stake in the quality of grazing and in many parts of the State. they assure me the ranges are better now than when they began ranching many years ago. These are people who have a constant and intimate knowledge of range conditions. I urge early consideration of the question on range fee use. By Mr. DURKIN (for himself and",

DADDARIO: I wish to report to you on the resolution passed by the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture No. MT15 on \"Agricultural Data Systems\" a copy of which. I understand. has been submitted to your committee. This resolution. which calls for the integration of agricultural statistics into a single system. is of great importance to farmers because of the burden that is being placed upon them to give reports to both the Department of Agricultures Statistical Reporting Service and to the Bureau of Census. Evidence of this showed up in our State these past months as a reaction against the U.S. Census of Agriculture. In addition and possibly of even greater importance is the fact that the U.S. Census of Agriculture is now obsolete in view of the new methods of getting farms and agricultural statistics through a sampling process which is employed by the Statistical Reporting Service. The size. specialization and ownership of farms has changed to the point where it is no longer feasible to endeavor to make a canvass of all the farms in the United States to get the information. Therefore. a new system such as that suggested by the American AgriBusiness Association needs to be put into effect. There are two other advantages that I would like to stress. First. the information will become available much more promptly when it is needed than has been true with the Census for a long time. Second. when the data is collected in cooperation with the State Departments of Agriculture. as is done by the Statistical Reporting Service. it is most advantageous and efficient from the standpoint of the time. work. and expense that is incurred. I urge your committee to give favorable consideration and support to this resolution. Cordially.",
