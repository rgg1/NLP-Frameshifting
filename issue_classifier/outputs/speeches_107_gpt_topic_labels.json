I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding the time. and I rise today in support of this conference report because it does work to take care of our Nations veterans. and it does work to protect our environment. For our Nations veterans. this bill provides for over a billion dollars in increases over last years bill for veterans health care. The bill also provides additional funding for the veterans benefits administration to expedite claims processing. Also. important to my home district. this bill provides $850.000 for the University of West Florida through EPA to conduct an environmental health study in Escambia County. In 1998. EPA wrote Escambia County ranked 22nd out of more than 3.300 counties nationwide in the amount of toxic releases reported by the agency. Over the last couple of years. there has been mounting anecdotal evidence suggesting that these toxic levels have attributed to an increase in illnesses in northwest Florida. It is time to find some real answers. The study will compile environmental information. coordinate research. evaluate risks to the health of our citizens. and provide the information necessary to remedy the situation. I want to express my thanks to the gentleman from New York . the gentleman from Florida",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from West Virginia for yielding me the time. I rise in strong support of the bill. Let me start out by saying that I appreciate the fact that the chairman and the ranking member increased the amount of funding for NASA than what was in the Presidents request. We did not get everything we wanted for NASA. but we got more than what was originally proposed. I also think that the committee was very wise in increasing the funding for basic science funding research through the National Science Foundation. which we now know that basic science research has been critical to the economic expansion that we enjoyed in the prior 8. almost 9. years. Most importantly. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee for accepting the higher level of funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and for natural disasters. As Members know. earlier this year before the events of September 11. which this Congress has very wisely and very strongly dealt with. we in Texas. and particularly in the greater Houston area. suffered a tremendous natural disaster as a result of Tropical Storm Allison. There were a number of Members including myself who were down here on the floor arguing for sufficient funding just as the effects of this storm were unraveling. As we now know. nearly 80.000 people in the greater Houston area were affected by the storm: 50.000 homes took on water. The major hospitals were closed down. and the total cost was probably around $5 billion. The Federal share will be close to $2 billion as part of this storm. and I just want to commend the chairman and the ranking member for the work that they did. that they have stepped up to the plate and provided what is a basic function of the Federal Government in stepping to aid its people in times of crisis. Just as we have done rightly so in New York and with the Pentagon. we have also done in this bill as it relates to the people of Texas and of the greater Houston area as a result of Tropical Storm Allison. and I appreciate the work that both sides did on this.",

    "speech": "First and foremost. Mr. Speaker. I want to commend the conferees for the great job they have done on this VAHUD conference bill. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics. I am particularly pleased with the commitment by the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from West Virginia to make sure that the NASA budget continues to make sure that America provides a leadership in space and keeps America number one in space endeavors. The conferees showed good judgment in producing a bill that requires NASA to conduct many of the recommendations captured within the International Space Station Management Cost and Evaluation Report. I believe that this is the right course in establishing a credible Space Station program. It is with this achievement that we should continue to press NASA to stay on course concerning the other aerospace projects that are of critical importance to the American taxpayer. That is why I have requested from NASA a letter delivered to me tomorrow that specifically outlines a program within the space launch initiative that ensures an orbital flight demonstration experiment involving the X37 vehicle. so we can verify this cuttingedge technology and its benefit as a space transportation system. In the past. NASA has been disappointing in producing space hardware and flight hardware that satisfied our launch needs. This time it is now time to move forward aggressively developing the means to access space affordably and effectively. The X37 project represents a major milestone in moving us closer to this goal. Let us hope that this week marks a sea change in attitude at NASA to start thinking boldly and creatively as we enter the 21st century and beyond. We need to have space launch. and we need to make sure we have the technology developed that will keep America the number one space power. We also must be concerned about the taxpayers. Mr. Speaker. I congratulate the conferees on their commitment to both of these goals.",

The FHA multifamily loan programs support the new construction and substantial rehabilitation of much needed affordable rental housing. Our Nation faces a growing affordable housing crisis for low- and moderateincome families. Yet the FHA multifamily loan limits have not been raised in 9 years. How can we expect the private sector to produce affordable rental housing. when they cannot receive affordable financing? Construction costs have risen more than 25 percent since the last increase. One simple way to stimulate the development of affordable housing in our communities is to increase the multifamily loan limits. In my home State of New York. the current limit is $87.226 per twobedroom unit. In the last 4 years not one unit has been produced under the FHA multifamily loan program. due to that low number. The 25percent increase established in this conference agreement would raise the limit in New York to $106.952. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this necessary and important increase that will benefit so many working families throughout our Nation.",

Included in the VAHUD conference report is a provision requested by myself and Senator BEN NELSON of Florida. The provision directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency to report to the committee within 3 months on their most uptodate understanding of the potential health and safety risks to children playing on and around arsenictreated wood playground equipment. The report will also include the steps the EPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission are taking to keep state and local governments. and the public. informed about the risks associated with arsenictreated wood. It responds to a study released today by the Environmental Working Group and the Healthy Building Network. which estimates that one our of every 500 children who regularly play on swing sets and decks made from arsenictreated wood will develop lung or bladder cancer later in life as a result of these exposures. It is important in these times of changing priorities that the health and wellbeing of children remain foremost in our minds. The parents of Indianapolis and communities all over the Nation are looking forward to the findings of this report.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the efforts of the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee under difficult circumstances. As most Members know. the allocation of the subcommittee was insufficient to adequately fund the Department of Veterans Affairs. and particularly veterans medical care. While I am disappointed about the appropriations provided in the conference agreement for veterans. I realize the extraordinary conditions under which we have had to work this session. I hope that we can redress some of the shortcomings in this years budget in the next fiscal year. As a nation. we are now engaged in the first war of the 21st century. We must be prepared to provide the benefits and services of our future veterans as well as meet the needs of those men and women who have honorably served our Nation in uniform in years past. This is a moral obligation of our Nation. Undoubtedly. major additional funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs and particularly veterans medical care and services can be fully justified. As the need for additional funding becomes more obvious in the weeks and months ahead. I look forward to the administration submitting a request for the additional funding which is clearly needed. Until that time. VA will continue to do its best to meet its missions. But VA can only do more with insufficient resources for so long. A day of reckoning is fast approaching. We must do better by our Nations veterans. While we have improved upon the Presidents request. the Department of Veterans Affairs still estimates shortfalls for delivenng current services in FY 2002. This year we will continue to pass legislation encouraging VA to do more. including managing its role as a backup provider to the Department of Defense in times of war or national emergency and combating bioterrorism. I want VA to fulfill these roles. but I also want to ensure that they have adequate resources to take on these challenges. This Sunday. November the 11th. when Members of this body are praising our veterans past deeds and stressing the importance of a strong national defense. I ask all Members of this House to make a commitment to our deeds and our actions reflect our words. We must provide adequate resources to our past and present servicemembers. We can do less.",

Tens of thousands of working families in our country pay more than 50 percent of their income toward housing. or live in severely inadequate housing. Yet. the FHA multifamily loan program has not kept pace with construction costs. For example. in the last four years only one project with 192 units was produced in Cincinnati. despite the nearly twenty thousand working families facing critical housing needs there. Without affordable financing. developers cannot produce affordable housing stock. With the increasing need for housing far outpacing the available supply. the need for available FHA financing is critical. By increasing the loan limits by 25 percent. the first increase since 1992. we can provide a vehicle to alleviate the housing crisis facing our nation. I urge strong support for this provision.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity to honor a friend of Northern Virginia. Mrs. Elizabeth Hartwell. who dedicated her life to protecting the environment. I want to recognize her life and all of her contributions to the Eleventh District of Virginia. Mrs. Hartwell began her quest to protect the environment in 1966. when she learned of plans to rezone part of Northern Virginia. Mason Neck. a wildlife habitat. She made modest films of the wildlife that thrived there and showed it to civic organizations around the region. She even gave tours by boat along Mason Necks waterways. She formed a committee and. with the backing of local officials. saved 5.000 acres of Mason Neck for use as park land. She served on many boards to help care for the environment. She was a member and vice chairman of the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority. Mrs. Hartwell also served as secretary and vice president of the Conservation Council of Virginia and chairman of the Citizens Council for a Clean Potomac. Some of her time was spent with the Audubon Naturalist Society. Mrs. Hartwell was the organizer of \"Friends of Mason Neck.\" Due to her efforts. the 2.277acre Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge was formed. making it the first area established for the protection of bald eagles. Also created were the 1.804acre Mason Neck State Park and the 1.003acre Pohick Regional Park. During his term. formei Governor Linwood Holton appointed her to the Virginia Board of Agriculture. Later she was appointed to the board of Fairfax County Wetlands for seven years. Former Governors Charles Robb and Gerald Baliles both appointed Mrs. Hartwell to the Northern Virginia Potomac River Basin Committee. Her efforts to protect the environment were rewarded with dozens of honors and awards. In 1976. Mrs. Hartwell was named the Virginia Wildlife Federation Conservationist of the Year. In 1990. she won the Fairfax County Park Authoritys Elly Doyle Park Service Award. Mr. Speaker. in closing. I wish the very best to Mason Neck State Park as they honor Mrs. Elizabeth Hartwell on April 21. 2001 in Fairfax. Virginia. She dedicated her life to nature and helping the environment and I call upon all of my colleagues to join me in celebrating her remarkable life. Because of her efforts. Northern Virginia today is an even better place to live. work. and raise a family.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 974. \"the Small Business Interest Checking Act of 2001.\" This bill will repeal the prohibition against banks paying interest on checking accounts. When this bill was considered in the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions. I expressed my concern that this legislation could be interpreted in a way that would effectively eliminate the financial benefits and checking services that large depositors now receive from banks in lieu of interest. These services are now provided in accordance with substantial interpretive guidance that has been issued by the Federal Reserve under Regulation Q. Current law states that the provision or the receipt of such services and benefits does not constitute interest. I am pleased that Chairman OXLEY agreed to modify the bill by including a new section and accompanying report language. These provisions clarify that the current provision of services by banks in accordance with Regulation Q will be continued. This legislation will not alter the legal definition of interest for real estate closing escrow transactions and provides that current Regulation 0 Federal regulatory interpretations regarding the definition of interest on deposits will continue to stand. Title companies and agents currently receive bank services that defray the overall cost of maintaining real estate settlement escrows. These services subsidize settlement service operations. ultimately lowering the cost of closing and settlement services to the public. As a highly developed financial system. Federal banking law and regulations have consistently operated to facilitate the smooth and efficient flow of real estate transactions and promoted American homeownership. I am grateful that the Committee included a clear statement of congressional intent with respect to this issue in relationship to the proposed changes in the bill and I fully support H.R. 974.",

Mr. Speaker. today the House is considering House Concurrent Resolution 291. a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress with respect to endometriosis. Reported unanimously by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. this resolution will help raise awareness about a common disease that can unfortunately lead to devastating consequences for many women. Endometriosis is a painful. chronic gynecologic disease affecting approximately 10 to 20 percent of American women of childbearing age. Of those affected. about 30 to 40 percent will experience infertility. Unfortunately. the cause of endometriosis is unknown. and there is still no cure. Diagnosis can be difficult to confirm without surgery. and it is typically delayed by an average of 9 years. The National Institutes of Health is currently conducting several studies that may lead to other treatment options. Hormone treatments may show some success so that women affected by endometriosis may still be able to bear children. The resolution before us today recognizes the need for improved patient support. improved physician awareness. and more effective treatments. including a cure.

I would like to commend the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Chairman TAUZIN) and my good friend. the gentleman from Florida . for their work in bringing attention to rare diseases and disorders. In the United States today. one in nine Americans suffer from a known rare disease or disorder for which there is often no good treatment or cure. The legislation sponsored by my colleagues works to correct that problem. Taken together. the Rare Diseases Act and its companion bill. the Rare Disease Orphan Product Development Act. encourage the development of better treatments. diagnostic procedures. and cures for large numbers of rare diseases and disorders. There are over 6.000 known rare diseases. and although each of them individually affects less than 200.000 people. the total number of Americans affected is over 25 million people. These acts build on the success of the Orphan Drug Act of 1983. which has led to the development of over 220 treatments for rare diseases and disorders. including Huntingtons disease. Lou Gehrigs disease. and Tourette syndrome. Still. patients with rare diseases continue to face challenges in receiving appropriate and adequate treatment. The National Commission on Orphan Diseases estimated that only onethird of patients receive an accurate diagnosis In the 3 to 5 years after the onset of symptoms. and 50 percent of the population is not accurately diagnosed until 7 or more years after the onset of symptoms. Research into rare diseases and disorders provides hope for thousands of Americans and their families. This legislation does not detract from other worthy congressional research priorities of the NIH. such as the Childrens Health Act of 2000. Instead. these bills increase funding for two programs that have already had a direct and positive impact on this community. They expand and enhance existing research under way at various institutes of the NIH. Again. I am pleased to support passage of these two pieces of legislation and stand ready to work with my esteemed colleagues to ensure that they are enacted into law. Mr. Speaker.

This is a bill which would work to the benefit of those suffering from rare diseases both by establishing an Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. and by providing for rare disease regional centers of excellence. A rare disease is defined in the United States as one affecting fewer than 200.000 Americans. There are around 6.000 known rare diseases. and it is estimated that about 25 million Americans are affected by them. Over 220 treatments have been developed in the last two decades for rare diseases. but many more are needed. The Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health was established in 1993 to promote research and provide information. However. this office was not given any authority. Also. although Congress has substantially increased research funding for NIH. funding for rare diseases has only increased slightly. This legislation increases to $25 million the Orphan Product Research Grant Program administered by the Office of Orphan Product Development at the Food and Drug Administration. thus encouraging more extensive research. testing. and attention.

Mr. Speaker. many people are unfamiliar with some of the diseases that were mentioned earlier. Today in Palm Beach County. there are a lot of diseases that have tremendous charity organizations helping to support them. to raise money. In fact. there is a ball a day that is pretty much dedicated to raising resources and to not only find research dollars. but hopefully find cures for diseases that ravage mankind. but most all of them are popular and well known. They may be AIDS. Alzheimers. things that people are well familiar with. Regrettably. the rare diseases do not have the same fan club.

His life is a model of one who honors and defends the Constitution. works to make our country a better place. and conducts himself with dignity and respect for others. I thank my dear friend for the many courtesies he has extended to me throughout the years. I will miss his kindness and friendship. To Senator HELMS and his wife. Dot. I wish them many years of happiness and continued good health in the bright years ahead.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to join my colleagues in honoring JESSE HELMS. the senior Senator from North Carolina. for his many years of service to his State and to the Nation. While Senator HELMS has served in the United States Senate for more than a quartercentury. his earlier years were equally active and productive. Following his service In the U.S. Navy during World War II. he became the city editor of the Raleigh Times. He served as Administrative Assistant to two U.S. Senators before becoming Executive Director of the North Carolina Bank Association in 1953. The Tarheel Banker became the largest State banking publication in the State while JESSE HELMS was its editor. He was Executive Vice President. Vice Chairman of the Board. and Assistant Chief Executive Officer of Capitol Broadcasting Company in Raleigh. NC from 1960 until his election to the Senate in 1972. During his service in the U.S. Senate. Senator HELMS has served as a member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. the Committee on Agriculture. Nutrition. and Forestry which he chaired in the 1980s. and the Foreign Relations Committee. of which he was a former chairman and the current ranking member. In 1973. he became the first Republican. as well as the first Senator from North Carolina. to receive the Golden Gavel. an award presented for presiding over the Senate for more than 117 hours. Senator HELMS was awarded a second Golden Gavel for presiding for more than 120 hours in 1974. It goes without saying that JESSE HELMS has become a fixture and a legend in this body. While Senator HELMS and I have often differed over the years in our approaches and our positions to the many important issues that have come before the Senate for consideration. Senator HELMS has always been a force to be reckoned with. His public service has been marked by hard work and diligence. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to serve with Senator HELMS over these many years and want to join my colleagues in paying tribute to him today.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. over the course of the day. we have heard from my colleagues many of Senator JESSE HELMS remarkable accomplishments over the course of his life. He is a husband. a father. a Senator. a Navy veteran. a defender of freedom. and a good friend. But above all. JESSE HELMS is a man of God. I should also add that he is a man of the people. Senator HELMS has seen more Senators. staffers. and pages in his tenure than most Members. and he treated all of them like they were from his own family. He is constantly noted for his friendly demeanor to those strangers who meet JESSE for the first time. but go away from their meetings feeling like a personal relationship has just formed. Senator HELMS has always been willing to take those precious extra few minutes when meeting someone to make personal connections that endure him to many. Rarely do people keep their convictions as strong as JESSE HELMS. especially facing the type of scrutiny that politicians do in the spotlight. Throughout his 30 years in the Senate. Senator HELMS has fought hard for the commonsense values that he brought with him from the great State of North Carolina. He has stood for the vision that our Founding Fathers imagined when they framed the Constitution. I cannot help but think that North Carolina and indeed our country is indebted to Senator HELMS for his service to our country. It has been a privilege to stand with the Senator on so many of the issues that are important to the United States. I am proud to call Senator HELMS a colleague and a friend. and we all know how much his leadership will be missed in this institution. Thank you. JESSE. for your continued dedication not only to the Senate. but also your country which is so near and dear to your heart.",

Mr. Speaker. it has been fifty days since September 11th. and yet the House of Representatives has still not acted to pass an airline security bill.

It has been twenty days since the other body voted unanimously to provide for aidine security. and still. the House has not yet passed an airline security bill. You might think that this delay was because our leaders were searching for a novel approach. or a wellcalibrated solution. But. in fact. it was because of a partisan dispute about whether the screeners should be Federal employees. This despite that the fact that an overwhelming majority of Americans have said that they want the Federal Government to run airport security. In the wake of the September 11th attacks. Americans asked for. and received. an outpouring of bipartisan leadership from their elected officials. How sad that the one key thing that Congress must do to safeguard their security has been held up by a partisan dispute. I urge my colleagues to support this motion. and I urge you.

This motion would add vital funds to international aid programs that help both citizens of poor countries and it helps American farmers. Now. more than ever. since the attack of September 11. we must fund these programs at the highest levels possible. In the last 50 years almost 400 million people worldwide have died from hunger and from being poor. That is three times the number of people killed in all wars fought in the 20th century. Today almost 800 million people. about onesixth of the population of the worlds developing countries. do not have enough food. Two hundred million are children. U.S. food aid is essential in fighting world hunger. It has been instrumental in averting a famine in the Horn of Africa. It has helped redevelop Bosnias agricultural sector and feed more than 50.000 children in Haitian schools and hospitals. Food aid empowers people. families. communities. It enables them to break out of a cycle of hunger and poverty and return to lives of dignity. On a broader scale. food aid helps countries improve their peoples health. their incomes. and their living conditions. It helps them progress forward as a nation. And at the same time. the food aid helps our farmers across agricultural sectors. wheat. soybeans. rice. peas. milk to name a few. in one of the darkest times of our agricultural history. It has helped them to sell more of their products and keep their farms and their families secure. At a time when family farms are struggling daytoday for existence. international food aid offers them hope. After the tragic events of September 11. more than ever the United States needs to reach out to our neighbors. Our core principles of justice. liberty and opportunity are what makes this Nation strong. We must continue to live by them and promote them. We must continue to provide assistance. support developing nations. We must let these countries know that despite the unspeakable act of terror against our Nation. we will continue to stand strong with them in their fight to improve the lives of their citizens.",

Today. administrative assistants in the other body are paid. on average. $118.000. In this institution they are paid approximately $22.000 less per person. A legislative director in the other body is paid about $85.000. on average. That is about $25.000 more than we pay for similar responsibilities in the House. For a legislative assistant. the gap is about $15.000 between the pay afforded to a House staffer versus a Senate staffer. We have another provision in this bill which is going to make it even more difficult for House Members to retain our staff. because it will be much easier for the Senate to entice staffers to come to work for them. all because of a provision in this bill. There is a provision in this bill that enables the employees of the other body and CBO to begin a student loan repayment program. Now. I have nothing against that. but the problem is that that will not happen in the House of Representatives because we have not had the proper authorizations approved by the committee of jurisdiction in this House. That means that there will be yet another recruiting tool that will enable the Senate to entice our staffers away to work in the Senate. We cannot function as effectively as the Peoples House ought to function if we are essentially advised by people who have very short tenure in their jobs before they either move over to the Senate to get much better pay or before they go downtown to get much better pay than they can get working in either the Senate or the House. I would urge everyone with the appropriate responsibilities in this House to recognize that this provision in this bill today will add to our difficulties in retaining quality staff and attracting quality staff in competition with the other body. and I would urge them to take the appropriate action so that we will be able to compete with the other body on an even footing.

I came to Congress to promote more livable communities with the Federal Government being a better partner to make our families safe. healthy and economically secure. An important part of making those communities livable is ensuring that people have choices about where they live. work. and how they travel. During these troubled times that have fallen upon us since September 11. it is easy to lose sight of the essential daily items that improve quality of life. I commend my colleagues for moving forward on key provisions that will strengthen communities and give employees improved choices on how they live and work. These livability provisions include the full funding of an increase in the allowable amount to $65 for Legislative Branch employees participating in the transit benefit program. In addition to this important provision. language is also included to update bike facilities here on the Hill including providing new. more secure bike lockers for those Representatives and staff who bike to work. and to study alternatives for a staff fitness center.

In his capacity as Budget Officer. he controlled the formulation. justification. and execution of some $10 billion of our taxpayers funds in a manner that set him apart for his professionalism and courtesy. He has personally assisted the Appropriations Committee time and time again. and has been especially helpful when the chips were down and information was desperately needed to make our bills and reports come together. A native of Albuquerque. NM. Jess career began with a fouryear stint in the Air Force. Following this. he entered public service with the New Mexico State Employment Security Agency. after which he joined the Department of Labor. He and his wife. Myra. are retiring to San Juan.

    "speech": "program has worked well and provides a good model for the high intensity interstate gang activity area program that this bill creates. I expect that the high intensity interstate gang activity area program will help reduce the gang problem in the same way that the HIDTA program has helped reduce the drug problem. The bill also allows serious juvenile drug offenses to be Armed Career Criminal Act predicates. This provision ensures that career criminals do not escape higher sentences just because their most serious drug offenses occurred when they were a juvenile. Under this legislation. all armed career criminals will get up to the maximum statutory maximum of 15 years in jail. time which may be not reduced through suspension or probation. The bill makes the gang statute consistent with the Supreme Courts recent opinion in Apprendi v. United States. In that decision. the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be treated as an element of the offense. This decision has caused some problems for law enforcement in prosecuting gang crimes. This is because the Federal gang statute has been treated as a sentence enhancement statute. not a standalone criminal offense statute. Before Apprendi. prosecutors would charge gang members with drug and other crimes. If they were convicted. they would then ask the court to enhance the gang members sentence because of his or her membership in a criminal gang. On many occasions. this sentence enhancement would go beyond the statutory maximum for the underlying offenses. In light of Apprendi. this bill rewrites federal law to ensure that prosecutors can charge gang members for a separate offense under the federal gang statute. In doing so. the bill also makes it easier for prosecutors to charge gang members by reducing the membership requirement for a criminal gang from a minimum of five members to a minimum of three members. The bill authorizes $50.000.000 for 5 years to make grants to prosecutors officers to combat gang crime and youth violence. This money will help implement this legislation by ensuring that law enforcement has the money to prosecute gang members. This is important legislation. I urge my colleagues to act quickly to pass it. I would also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and an accompanying sectionbysection description be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing with my colleagues. Senators MURKOWSKI. REID of Nevada. NELSON of Florida. INHOFE. WARNER and BURNS legislation entitled the Spaceport Equality Act. Currently airports. high speed rail. seaports. mass transit. and other transportation projects can raise money through the issuance of taxexempt bonds. The Spaceport Equality Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to clarify that spaceports enjoy the same favorable tax treatment. The U.S. aerospace industry manufactures nearly 70 percent of the worlds satellites. but only 40 percent of the satellites that enter the atmosphere are launched by this country. Our Nations spaceports are a vital component of the infrastructure needed to expand and enhance the U.S. role in the international space arena. The Spaceport Equality Act is an important step in increasing our competitive position in this emerging industry. This bill will stimulate investment in expanding and modernizing our Nations space launch facilities by lowering the cost of financing spaceport construction and renovation. Upon enactment. the bill will increase U.S. launch capacity. and enhance both our economic and national security. The commercial space market is expected to become increasingly more competitive in the next decade. The ability to have a robust space launch capability is in our best interests economically as well as strategically. My proposal does not provide direct Federal spending to our commercial space transportation industry. Instead. it creates the conditions necessary to stimulate private sector capital investment in infrastructure. This bill offers Congress the chance to help open a new age to space. where the States and local communities can themselves take part in space transportation. To be state of the art in space requires state of the art financing on the ground. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this important effort by cosponsoring this bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a short summary of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

Then he continued his studies and his desire to become a priest led him to Mount St. Marys College and Seminary where he earned a masters in systematic theology and in theology in counseling. When Father Cappelloni returned to northeastern Pennsylvania. he spent time on the faculties of several schools and took the time to guide and counsel young students. He received his first pastoral assignment to St. Martin of Tours in Jackson. Pennsylvania. where he restored the church into a beautiful house of worship and served there until recently when he was transferred to Holy Name of Jesus in Scranton.

I was one of the first in our country to ask for much stricter accountability. to test not only students but also teachers. and to hold schools to a very high standard. If they did not succeed in passing 85 percent of their children beyond a level of acceptable learning outcomes. the school would be in danger of being taken over. That was 18 years ago. So there is really nothing new in what we are discussing today. as the Senator from Nevada knows so well. We want to do the best job we can in raising standards. yes. we do. That is something many of us have worked on. and we have actually seen some positive results in some of our schools over the last 18 years. But we know there have to be the kind of conditions in learning circumstances in our classes. in our schools. that will enable these accountability measures to be successful.",

I thank him for working so hard in a very bipartisan way to produce a bill. The reforms are pretty well agreed to. Both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are coming together to say: We need a change. Business as usual in our education system is not going to cut it anymore. There are too many children falling behind and nobody in this country wants that to happen. Every one of us knows our democracy depends on a welleducated populace. Most people would agree that the variations in the standards of our public schools across the country mean we are not succeeding in the mandate for a quality public education system. That is why Chairman JEFFORDS and Senator KENNEDY. Senator COLLINS. Senator FRIST. Senator GREGG. Senator HUTCHINSON of Arkansas. Senator SESSIONS of Alabama. and Senator ENZI have worked so hard to make sure this bill does not fall by the wayside. I am a little frustrated that it has taken so long to get this bill to the floor. After all. this is a bill we have debated before. We actually debated it last session. It was not passed. We are back again. Surely there are divisions. but lets get the divisions out there. Lets get them out there. Lets make the decisions and lets reform public education so that every child in our country will have the opportunity to reach his or her full potential with a public education. That is our goal. Mr. President. I ask the Senator from Oregon if his State has a testing program with accountability that would be something we would want to have as a nation.

We would like better results for that. I commend the Senator from Texas and others on the committee. Senator COLLINS. and our friends on the Democratic side who are focusing on some very significant reforms in this bill. If I can cut through the arguments I am hearing. as I have listened and presided today. often we tend to confuse what we are about. whether we are about developing a system of employment for adults or whether we are about developing a system for educating children. If we can keep the focus on educating children. there are all kinds of things that become possible in terms of testing. not just kids but teachers as well. to make sure we are delivering results. that we are giving parents more choices so we give their children more chances. In a nutshell. that is what I want to vote for: more resources but also more reform. If we do that. the American people will look at our work as Republicans and Democrats and thank us for generations to come. There is not a single thing we could do more significantly for the future of our country. for the parents and their children. than to provide more resources and to demand more reform.

I would like to detail a heinous crime that occurred July 29. 2000 in Mahwah. New Jersey.

Dianne ODell was diagnosed with polio and. soon after. began her life in an iron lung. Her parents. Freeman and Geneva. were told Dianne would not reach adulthood. Now. more than 50 years later. Dianne is still going strong. It is believed she has lived longer in an iron lung than anyone else in the world. Ms. ODells physical handicaps have not discouraged her. While living inside the yellow. sevenfootlong iron lung. she used a twoway radio to complete coursework and graduate from Jackson High School. She took classes from FreedHardeman College. now FreedHardeman University. and accepted an honorary doctorate in psychology from FreedHardeman. She wrote a childrens book. \"Blinky Less Light.\" and is currently working on her autobiography. Dianne says she has been able to reach her goals despite her physical limitations because of positive thinking and her sense of humor. She often refers to her iron lung as her \"yellow submarine\" and enjoys having it decorated for holidays. Dianne remembers one Halloween when she costumed the machine as a giant roll of Life Savers candy. Ms. ODell also credits her strong sense of faith. She worships with the Campbell Street Church of Christ in her hometown of Jackson. Tennessee. although she is not able to attend services. Members of the congregation bring her taped sermons and the Lords Supper. Diannes family has also played a valuable role. Mr. and Mrs. ODell. along with Diannes two sisters. have been by their daughters side her whole life. often making personal sacrifices for her health. Over the years. Ms. ODell has worked with others coping with disabilities. especially families with disabled children. She tells them how important it is to keep faith and a positive outlook. I believe Diannes spirit and love of life are encouragingnot only to those facing similar situations. but to all of us.

An outgoing yet introspective young Jennifer displayed her writing skills at an early age. Little blank books became filled with poetry. and an antique typewriter became a favorite tool for composing stories. An old upright piano. passed on by Jennifers grandmother. Ruth Smith. a beloved music teacher and musician. served as the instrument for the composition of early songs. including \"The Energy Crisis\" written in the early 70s. Jennifer said. dreaming of being a star is one thing. but for a small town girl raised on a dairy farm. actually knowing how one goes about such a thing is quite another. \"There were many challenges.\" Her first years of college were spent at Michigan State University where she pursued a career that included music. Jennifer moved to Ann Arbor in 1990. Once settled and working at the University of Michigan. she turned her attention again to making music and writing songs. Picking up and learning to play the guitar soon led to many finished songs and trips to Nashville. Jennifer launched her own music publishing company. The Michigan Rose Music Co.. and record label. Michigan Rose Records. In June 2001. Michigan Rose Records released its first single. True North. the title cut to Jennifers first CD. True North--relating to the life and death of Dale Earnhardt. the race car herowas recorded along with four other original songs in Nashville this past May. The CD. which was recorded and produced by Phil Dillon at Nickel City Studios. features her daughter Jackie on background vocals and a group of worldclass Nashville studio musicians.

It is important that we enact legislation to reform the conflictdriving diamond trade. and this is an important first step. Mr. Speaker. for years terrorist bands masquerading as political rebels have been using income from the illicit trade in diamonds to fund their attacks on civilian populations. The scars that they have left are deep. They are seen every where on the mangled limbs and faces of men. women and children on the streets of Monrovia and Freetown. As appalling as the profiteering of these groups. is the commercial support that they have received from brokers in the legitimate diamond trade in what we refer to as the developed world. While some of thee traders have dealt unknowingly in these blood diamonds. others have consciously taken advantage of their market position to \"launder\" these tainted goods. There is a clear need to establish a system which punishes those that are supporting terrorist bands that profit from diamond trading. and prevent dirty diamonds from entering the market which make legitimate dealers unwittingly complicit. The substitute for H.R. 2722 that we have before us is not perfect. but it is an important first step in creating such a system. Moreover. passing this bill will send a clear signal to those states. industries and NGOs participating in the Kimberiy Process. that the United States is serious about Clean Diamonds. I am confident that this bill will help move the Kimberly agenda forward. and that concrete steps to implement a verification system will be agreed to by all participating parties. This. after all. is the key. A verification system will not work unless it has the support of all those concerned.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I come to the floor today to make a brief statement about my cosponsorship of H.R. 3206. the \"Home Ownership Expansion and Opportunities Act.\" By cosponsoring this legislation. I am expressing my support for new ideas to provide additional opportunities for homeownership. This legislation is intended to bring more competition into the secondary mortgage marketplace. the result of which will be more opportunities and lower costs for homebuyers. The \"Home Ownership Expansion and Opportunities Act\" would allow the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) to guarantee the securities of conventional mortgages above the 85 percent loan to value ratio. up to the statutory conventional mortgage limit. In case of default. the participating private mortgage insurance companies (PMIs) would bear the first level of loss. Of course. our current mortgage financing system works well. After all. homeownership in the United States is at an all time high. Any system can be improved. however. so long as no industry or company is ceded any structural competitive advantage. Like any legislation. this proposal takes calculated risks to achieve demonstrable gains. First. the federal government will guarantee these mortgages. I see no reason. therefore. why we wouldnt see to it that certain affordable housing goals are met and enforced. In doing so we will ensure that all Americans have access to affordable financing so they can realize their dream of home ownership. Additionally. because the federal government will be taking on some of the risk associated with these mortgages. we must ensure that the program is managed in the most fiscally prudent manner. That is why the legislation includes a provision that any PMI participant receive an AA rating or better from a nationally recognized rating agency. and must meet additional requirements as determined by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). While the PMIs are regulated at the state level. we may want to consider additional safety and soundness mechanisms. to further minimize the risk to taxpayers. I look forward to working with my colleagues as this proposal moves through the legislative process. This bill serves as a starting point to begin the debate on how best to accomplish our goal of increasing homeownership for all Americans.",

I rise today with a heavy heart to denonunce the savage. senseless and cowardly attacks upon our citizens. our property and two of our most endearing symbols of national strength in yesterdays terrorist attacks on Washington. New York City and our nations passenger airlines. We have lived for years under the threat of terrorism and have thwarted several significant plots. We have invested a great amount of time and money to try and create an effective system of countermeasures. Unfortunately. we have now seen just how far some people will go to harm the United States and what we stand for. No political or religious agenda could ever justify the hideous atrocities committed yesterday. and America will have to respond appropriately to ensure that those who would use terror against this country are never again in the position to strike us. As an international hub of commerce. the World Trade Center contained the offices of individuals from around the world who have suffered as a result of this attack. For that reason. this was not only an attack on America. but on all the nations of the world that trade with us. The mood is somber here in Washington today. but we are here and our government is working. Because of our society and our freedoms. we are always going to be susceptible. This heinous act will undoubtedly gain a new urgency to reduce the risks we face from terrorism. It is also critical for our allies and the entire world community to speak in one voice and say \"Terrorism in any form is wrong. and it will no longer be tolerated anywhere in the world. America has been hurt by these attacks. but we are far from defeated. We will care for our wounded and we will mourn those who lost their lives. We will then repair the physical damage to our institutions and seek out those who have perpetrated this obscenity upon us. We will have justice and we will emerge from this catastrophe stronger than before. As Ohios Seventh District Representative to the Congress of the United States. my thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by these attacks and their families. I would ask for all Americans to continue to pray for our nation in the difficult days ahead.",

The public in my view should not be forced to subsidize corporations. E 1645 This is a philosophical point but it goes to the question of this Market Access Program. Let me make the point that the Market Access Program is a leftover product of two previously failed USDA programs. One was the market promotion program and then the targeted export assistance program. both of which we debated on this floor. both of which we tried to reform. Basically. the Market Access Program funnels tax dollars to corporate trade associations and to cooperatives to advertise private products overseas. While proponents of the program claim that the Market Access Program boost its exports and creates jobs. there is no evidence to support that. As a matter of fact. the General Accounting Office studies indicate that this program has no discernible effect on U.S. agricultural exports. I believe the private sector knows how to advertise. It does not need government interference. I think that taxpayer dollars merely replace money that would be spent by private companies on their own advertising. and provisions in the 1996 farm bill have attempted to reform MAP but thus far have failed. Although the percentage of large companies that get this MAP money has decreased. a number of large corporations still receive millions indirectly through trade associations. In the last 10 years. Americas taxpayers basically paid out $1.5 billion for this particular subsidy. I think the American people would agree that their money would be better spent if this was relegated back to the private sector. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

With dropping prices for product and so forth. we have managed to double some exports.

Though the going is getting rougher in international waters in terms of trade. my goodness. this would be the last program one would want to eliminate in terms of helping both farmers in this country move product and in maintaining and turning around that yawning trade deficit which is a very serious underbelly inside this economy.

I rise in strong support of the Royce amendment. and I commend the gentleman from California for his hard work on this issue. Mr. Chairman. this is one of the most egregious examples of taxpayer subsidized corporate welfare. the MAP program. Hardworking taxpayers should not have to subsidize the advertising costs of Americas private corporations. Yet that is exactly what the MAP program does. Since 1986. the Federal Government has extracted nearly $2 billion from the pockets of American taxpayers and handed it over to multimillion dollar corporations and cooperatives to subsidize their marketing programs in foreign countries. When Congress. back in 1996. in the farm bill required MAP funds to be limited to farmer cooperatives and trade associations. proponents argued that the MAP funds would only be used to help small businesses and farmers. In fact. much of the funding went to large trade associations made up of some of the largest and most profitable corporations. Mr. Chairman. Congress should end the practice of wasting tax dollars on specialinterest spending programs and unfairly take money from hard working families to help profitable private companies pad their bottom line.

One of the arguments that was made by my colleague from California is that. well. other countries are in a position that they can do this advertising and it has been advantageous to them. The fact of the matter is that our consumer marketplace encourages that type of advertisement to go on of our products that are here made domestically in the United States. irrespective of what is going on in Chile or what is going on in France. I do not believe that the United States taxpayer should be subsidizing these advertising programs because. in fact. what winds up happening is that much of this advertising. I would argue all of it that is subsidized by the MAP program. would go on anyway because of the decisions made by the industry. that it is in their interest to encourage this type of development. The MAP program is another example of a program where I do not see it is very easy for us to point to demonstrated areas where the advertising has led to any more farmers. any more ranchers. any more production or sales.

All regions of the country benefit from the programs employment and economic effects from expanded agricultural exports markets.

I wanted to especially thank my dear colleagues. the gentleman from Maryland and the gentleman from Illinois . for reserving time this afternoon and checking in as this debate ensued on the floor in order to be able to join me in this debate. Let me say that our amendment proposes that as a part of our national energy strategy that biofuels and bioenergy be more than an afterthought but. in fact. be a central pillar of helping America reach a renewable energy future. 0l 1700 If you look at Americas trade accounts. our chief strategic vulnerability relates to imported fuels. We are willing to go to war. to send our young men and women to war. for oil. but we are not willing to invest the dollars here at home to propel ourselves into a more energy selfsufficient future. When the President of the United States and new Vice President produced a national energy report with solutions for the future. there was one gaping hole: Not a single recommendation relates to renewables and the use of biofuels. what we can take off our fields and forests. in order to have ethanol. biodiesel. and other such fuels made a part of Americas energy future. We declare an emergency. we set aside $500 million. and we say that biofuels are as important as natural gas. they are as important as petroleum. they are as important as any other fuel. whether it is windmills or turbines or whatever. in order to put America on a sound energy footing. We want to make sure that our message is heard loudly and clearly. Mr. Chairman.

My amendment takes the $2.95 million designated in this bill for costs associated with the reimportation provision and would transfer the funds back to the Food and Drug Administration general account. Clearly. in the wake of the Secretarys decision. the Agency no longer needs the funds for the purposes of reimportation. and my amendment would simply keep those funds within the Agency so they are not penalized to be used for program priorities at the Agencys discretion within such accounts as the prevention of BSE. TSE. mad cow disease and hoof and mouth disease. many of the challenges that are facing our country today. Given its tremendous responsibilities and challenges.

I would like to speak for a few moments about one such program. The Global Food for Education Initiative began last year as a pilot program. I want to make clear based on the report language accompanying this bill that the committee expects this program to continue through fiscal year 2002. and in turn this program will provide approximately 9 million hungry children in 38 countries with at least one nutritious meal each day and a chance to go to school. The report accompanying H.R. 2330 contains strong and explicit language in support of this program saying. \"The committee expects the Secretary of Agriculture shall continue in fiscal year 2002 the Global Food for Education Initiative program implemented in 2001 at the level implemented in fiscal year 2001. The assistance provided under this section shall be in addition to other demands for section 4169(b) and Public Law 480 title II commodities.\" Mr. Chairman.

The Department of Agricultures Natural Resource Conservation Service has the authority to undertake projects on watersheds that are smaller than 250.000 acres. This project meets that requirement.

I think the subcommittee chairman has done a wonderful job to put this bill together in essentially record fashion. I am grateful to him for his leadership. I am supportive of this bill because it has a strong research component for agriculture. production agriculture. to be sure that it has the tools and the information and the technology necessary to compete in a world market. That is what we need for our farmers. I also am pleased that this bill under the chairmans leadership has increased food safety and inspection. We have the safest food supply in the world and we must make sure that we acknowledge that and do not denigrate it in debate on the issue. because we have a very safe system. We need to keep it safe. We will keep it safe with the resources that are available in this bill. At the subcommittee and the full committee level. I had raised the issue of ecoterrorism. When we spend multimillions of dollars on agriculture research but yet some of that research gets destroyed by extremists. ecoextremists who seek to destroy agriculture research. then we need to make sure we. as taxpayers and as Members of this body. protect that research. This is not the place or the time for that issue and the discussion surrounding it. but it is an issue that we need to attend. My expectation is that we will attend to it as we go through the legislative process later in this year.

I strongly support the increase in funding for the EQIP program. the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. because it will help us achieve our national attainment goals in the area of clean water. The AFO/CAFO regulations are expensive. My State has adopted all of the implementing policy to assure compliance with the AFO/CAFO regulations. and the only reason frankly. the only possible way that small farmers can survive these costly regulations is through the technical assistance that the EQIP funds provide to them to help them determine what projects will. in fact. contain runoff. These funds give them some help in offsetting the costs of developing manure management programs and other modern approaches that will enable them to make a significant contribution to the cleanliness of our waterways and also. in the long run. to the revitalization of Long Island Sound. In New England. we have very steep. hilly farms. We also have more rainfall than other parts of the country. So the burden on us is. frankly. far higher than the burden on other parts of the country. We are not a part of the countr3V that benefits much from the farm bill through its crop assistance and other programs. but so some of its conservation dollars. and these EQIP dollars. are extremely important to us.

I am concerned that this measure is yet another repeat of past agriculture spending packageswhere Congress is providing fewerandfewer farmers with financial assistance.

This responsible bill addresses the needs of our nations farmers and ranchers while keeping in mind the desire of American consumers to buy affordable and safe agriculture products. I want to commend the full committee for passing a number of important amendments. Specifically. I am pleased that employees of the Farm Service Agency will be better able to deliver farm ownership. farm operating. and disaster loans through improved salary and expense funding and through additional resources for agricultural credit programs. This assistance will come as a welcome relief as the workload of this vital agency has grown in response to a weakening farm economy. I am also pleased with the investment this bill makes in the future safety and health of our citizens and our environment. The research that will be facilitated and advanced through this bill will ensure the continued quality of our food supply by improving safeguards. The conservation programs within the bill also reflect foresight. The desire of farmers to preserve American soil exemplifies the respect and attachment they have for the land in which they are invested. Lastly. I am encouraged by the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program which will link rural Americans with resources and opportunities previously available only in urban areas. As we seek a prosperous future for our rural residents. we must find ways to stimulate local economies. This bill advances that goal through education and enhanced services that will enable individuals and families to stay in their hometowns while receiving education and health services. Using technology to provide useful links between rural and urban areas will slow the flight to cities and preserve smaller towns and municipalities. which are vital pieces of the American fabric.

Despite local governments acknowledging the need for upwards of 23.000 new units to meet the housing demand. the plans for housing development at Fort Ord contain insufficient. if not meager. units available to the local workforce. Instead. that free Federal land will be used to build megamansions out of financial reach for our local workers. With the language in this bill. title transfers are put on hold until the plans for housing development at Fort Ord reflect a better mix of affordable housing. The local reuse authority is aware of the urgent nature of this language and todays debate and has agreed to reexamine the housing development plans at Fort Ord. I feel confident that eventually this limitation on the Army can be lifted and land transfers for housing development at Fort Ord can proceed again. I appreciate the Chairmans support and assistance in the matter. He has been a tremendous help in signaling to the Fort Ord community its need to concentrate on affordable housing. given the valuable land that is being given to them.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of H.R. 5011. the Military Construction Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003. It is the second bill we are considering pursuant to the 302(b) allocations filed by the Appropnations Committee on June 24th. I am pleased to report that it is consistent with the levels established in H. Con. Res. 353. the House concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2003. which we subsequently deemed as having the effect of a conference report on the resolution. The budget resolution provided $393.8 billion in budget authority for national defense. including $10 billion for a war reserve fund. This bill funds the military construction and family housing portion of that commitment to our men and women in uniform. H.R. 5011 provides $10.1 billion in new budget authority and $10.1 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2003. It is therefore equal in budget authority and outlays to the 302(b) allocation to the House Subcommittee on Military Construction Appropriations. It does not contain emergencydesignated new BA. It does include $50 million worth of rescissions of previously enacted BA and $3 million in related outlays. Accordingly. the bill complies with section 302(f) of the Budget Act. which prohibits consideration of bills in excess of an appropriations subcommittees 302(b) allocation of budget authority and outlays established in the budget resolution. H.R. 5011 represents this Houses solemn commitment to the quality of life of those who put their lives on the line every day for our freedom. It not only addresses the longterm infrastructure problems at military bases. it sustains barracks. family housing. medical facilities. and child support centers across the country and at bases overseas. It also provides infrastructure funding for National Guard and Reserve troops who now find themselves on the front lines of the war against terrorism. In conclusion. I express my support for H.R.",

This bill is important legislation that will strengthen our nations defense capability in addition to directly benefiting our nations military community by improving the quality of life for our dedicated military personnel and their families. The bill ensures that the infrastructure and facilities at our military installations get needed attention. Towards this end. I am especially pleased that this bill includes $75 million in military construction projects for Guam. protecting its strategic role to our national security in the Western Pacific. I am most pleased that this bill includes funding for Phase III of the Guam Army National Guard Readiness Center. The funding will complete the remaining designs for this Armory and provide for necessary training. assembly. and physical fitness space that will allow for demanded readiness and mission capability levels to be fulfilled. Moreover. the bill includes $15 million for a new onbase water supply system for Andersen Air Force Base. a project that will provide a reliable and safe water supply system essential for mission. fire protection. living conditions. and quality of life. Additionally. I am pleased that the bill includes roughly $17 million to continue the replacement of Andersens hydrant fuel system. funding that will equip the base with the largest fuel capability in the entire Pacific. The people of Guam welcome this significant continuation in military construction activity and appreciate the recognition this funding provides for our people in uniform. particularly the Guam Army National Guard. I urge passage of H.R. 5011 as it bolsters our national defense. advances our readiness and supports our men and women in uniform. I commend the Chairman. Mr. HOBSON. and the Ranking Member.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. for much of the twentieth century. our great steel companies churned and poured out the material used to build our nation creating the skeletons of our battleships. military equipment and installations. Today. during floor consideration of the Military Construction Appropriations Act of 2003 . I intended to offer an amendment to ensure that only domestic steel could be used for military construction. However. due to restrictions under the rule for funding limitations. my amendment was subject to a point of order and was not offered. For the record. I would like to fully explain the intent of this amendment. Mr. Speaker. my amendment to Section 108 of H.R. 5011 was designed to help American industry ailing from the effects of globalization. Section 108 currently states that no funds appropriated in H.R. 5011 may be used for procurement of steel for construction projects or activities for which Amencan Steel producers have been denied the opportunity to compete for such steel procurement. While I support this provision. the goal of my amendment was to strengthen that Section and require that the funds made available in H.R. 5011 would be spent on purchasing equipment. products or systems which contain steel manufactured in the United States. In other words. competition is good. but I wanted to go one step further and guarantee our military construction contracts involve U.S. steel. Our national defense depends on a healthy U.S. steel industry and it makes sense to offer some federal guarantees to this struggling industry at this critical time. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the House and the Senate to ensure the dollars we spend will protect the security of America. protect American jobs and the livelihood of the American Steel worker.",

TX. for their outstanding efforts to help those who were affected by the tragic events of September 11. Due to heightened security issues in Washington. DC. 25 students from All Saints were forced to cancel their school trip to our Nations capital. Nonetheless. on September 24. 2001. the All Saints Episcopal school chapel held a service and donated the offering to the New York City Relief Fund. All Saints Episcopal was able to make a donation of nearly $8.000 to the victims families through the American Red Cross. This U.S.A. Blue Ribbon School of Excellence is also participating in an ongoing endeavor to raise money for the Afghan Childrens Relief fund. More than 10 million children in Afghanistan suffer from the effects of Taliban repressive policies. Over the past 20 years Afghan children and their families have faced war. earthquakes. drought. and poverty. Now. many of them live in refugee camps where there is not enough food and water. or warm blankets to protect them from the cold winds of the brutal Afghan winter. The students donation to the American Fund for Afghan Children will help feed and shelter children living in this cruel environment. The students motivation set an inspirational path which should encourage Americans to continue this humanitarian effort. It is with great pride that I recognize All Saints Episcopal School for their tremendous accomplishments and dedication to the United States.",

The Elks Lodge has occupied the same small building on Garfield Street in Long Branch since its founding in 1901. The lodge has served the community of Long Branch and hosted gala fairs and many important events in Long Branchs history. Lodge 742. known as \"the lodge by the sea\" has served the elite lodge of south central New Jersey since its inception. Lodge 742 has the distinction of being the lodge to host the first ever reunion of the New Jersey State Elks Association in June 1914. It has hosted a total of over 10.000 participants in events over the past 100 years. The lodge is much more than a building. more than just a group for historical curiosity. and more than just an address on Garfield Street. The lodge is a representation of the people of Long Branch. its history. society. and longevity. The lodge has had 742 members over its history and has contributed so much to the grandeur and excitement of the city of Long Branch. Now entering its second century of \"Elkdom\".

I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for introducing this important resolution. and I appreciate his efforts to recognize the importance of historically Black colleges and universities. HBCUs. as they are known. were created more than 150 years ago to provide African Americans with access to higher education. and currently there are 105 historically Black colleges and universities across the United States. In my State of Ohio. there are two HBCUs. Wilberforce and Central State Universities. that provide an invaluable education to the youth of Ohio. While comprising only 3 percent of our Nations 2- and 4year institutions. HBCUs are responsible for producing 28 percent of all bachelors degrees and 15 percent of all masters degrees and 17 percent of all first professional degrees earned by African Americans. In 1998. Congress enacted the Higher Education Amendments to make improvements to programs designed to help HBCUs strengthen their institutions and graduate and professional programs under the Higher Education Act. and these changes included allowing institutions to use Federal money to build their own endowments and to provide scholarships and fellowships for graduate and professional students. Since 1995. Congress has increased its financial support of HBCUs by 89 percent. and President Bushs fiscal year 2003 budget. passed by this House in March. included more than $213 million. a $7 million increase over the current fiscal year. to strengthen HBCUs across the country. Mr. Speaker. over the last 2 years leaders here in Congress have continued to demonstrate their commitment to historically Black colleges and universities. The Committee on Education and the Workforce has visited a number of HBCU campuses within the last year to consider the issues and concerns of minorityserving institutions to better address their needs through Federal education programs.

Onethird of all black students in college go to HBCUs. These distinguished institutions of higher learning place doctors. lawyers. legislators. educators. business owners. community leaders and Americas black middle class into the mainstream of society. What were once the only options for Americans of African descent to receive post secondary education are now attractive options where students can learn in a rich. historic environment. So many young citizens have been given the opportunity to attain their full potential because of HBCUs. Many of them are from underserved communities. These are students who may have never had the chance to go to college were it not for the presence of historically Black colleges and universities in their respective States around the country. As one that used to play a little football. I am particularly thankful to HBCUs for producing the first black player to be drafted in the National Football League. Paul \"Tank\" Younger. About 100 NFL players right now have HBCU roots. including the Tennessee Titans very distinguished quarterback Steve McNair. a fantastic quarterback who hails from Alcorn State in Mississippi. Congress. both Democrats and Republicans. has recognized the importance of historically Black colleges and universities and voted to increase funding by 41 percent over the next 5 years. President Bush has continued this dedication by supporting similar increases so many more students can aspire to achieve their hopes and their dreams. As most of the presidents of HBCUs from around the Nation gather in Washington this week. it is fitting to showcase the many benefits derived from a unique and distinguished network of schools. This resolution urges the White House to issue a proclamation calling on others to support HBCUs with appropriate activities. ceremonies. financial contributions and programs. Nearly half a million students attend historically Black colleges and universities. We must do everything possible to further promote their role in higher education and the contributions they make to better the lives of so many young Americans.

    "speech": "I appreciate Senator BYRD bringing that up. Our country was founded on an ideal that no matter who you are or the circumstances of your birth. no matter how much money your parents have or dont have. if you are willing to work hard. study. and get a good education. you can be a success. This is the American dream. Unfortunately. the dream is slipping away. It is slipping because our classrooms are overcrowded. our schools are crumbling. and our students dont have the educational tools from preschool to college they need to learn. For years we have been nibbling around the edges for a solution. we tweak a program here. tweak another program there. but we have not made a real dent in education reform. The fact is. now only 2 cents of every $1 is invested in education. That is not enough. Ask the constituents in Montana or Iowa. in any town meeting: Of every Federal dollar we spend. how much goes for education? Ask your constituents. I have gotten answers from 25 cents to 10 cents to 12 cents to 8 cents. I have never gotten the right answer. which is 2 cents. Two cents out of every Federal dollar that we spend goes to education. That just is not enough. It shows that education is not a top priority. In this new century. we need a new plan for American education. a bold. daring plan to demand true accountability from our schools but also to provide the resources they need to meet the standards and to be held accountable. It is one thing to say you will hold the schools accountable but then you will not give them the resources. As my colleague and my chief cosponsor. Senator WELLSTONE. has said many times. you are setting them up for failure when you do that. If you want schools to be accountableand we all dowe have to get them the resources they need. We need to use our budget surpluses to prepare for the future by paying down the debt and investing in education. That is why. along with the many other Senators. I am proposing a plan to truly leave no child behind. Cosponsors of this amendment are Senators WELLSTONE. KENNEDY. MURRAY.",

    "speech": "Madam President. we have a circumstance in which we fund those priorities of improving education. providing a meaningful prescription drug benefit. strengthening our national defense. and also set aside some money to deal with this longer term problem. Our friends on the other side of the aisle havent provided a nickel to deal with this longterm debt crisis that is coming our way. They havent provided a dime for that purpose. We have set aside $750 billion to deal with this longterm budget circumstance. this longterm budget challenge of the baby boomers starting to retire and. when they do. us not having sufficient resources to keep the promise that has been made. Madam President. I will end on this note as I notice other colleagues have arrived. The fundamental difference between the Democrat budget plan and the Republican budget plan can be summed up on this chart of short- and longterm debt reduction. Of the projected $5.6 trillion that is available if this budget forecast comes through. we reserve $3.65 trillion for short- and longterm debt reduction. President Bushs plan reserves $2 trillion. So while he has a bigger tax cutabout twice as big as what we proposewe have about twice as much money for shortterm and longterm debt reduction. That is the fundamental difference between these two plans. It is up to people to decide what they think is the wiser course. We believe. given the uncertainty of these financial projections. given the magnitude of our current debt and the debt that is coming our way when the baby boomers start to retire. it is much wiser to put more of this money aside for short- and longterm debt reduction than to put it aside for a big tax cut. Those are the differences. Our tax cut would still permit rate reductions. Our tax cut would permit reforming the estate tax. and addressing the marriage penalty. and an immediate fiscal stimulus of $60 billion. But beyond that. we think the money is better put to paying down the shortterm and longterm debt. Madam President. I yield the floor.",

This is real economic stimulus because the families in Minnesota that would get the additional benefits. much less in Oklahoma. Nevada. and Rhode Island. will consume. They have to consume because right now they cannot make ends meet month by month. They will buy food. They will go out and buy a washing machine if it is broken down because they need it.

Mr. Chairman. last week the Members of our body voted to send a message to the Bush administration that oil and water do not mix. The House voted overwhelmingly to stop offshore drilling off the coast of Florida by a vote of 247 to 164. Seventy Republicans joined 177 Democrats in a rebuke to the White House drilling policy. Nonetheless. Vice President CHENEY claims that drilling can be conducted without environmental damage. Where does the administration stop in its singleminded desire to appease the oil and gas special interests? How many times do we have to send this message before the administration gets it? The BoniorStupakKaptur amendment is a message: handsoff the Great Lakes. The President and Vice President need to understand that the people of the Great Lakes region do not want drilling. In my State. our Republican Governor is opposed to drilling in the Great Lakes. So are both our Republican Senators and our congressional delegation. Lake Erie. Ohios lake. is the shallowest of the Great Lakes and thus the most vulnerable to the administrations scheme. The Lake Erie shoreline. including the area in my congressional district. is a delicate ecosystem. Congressman DINGELL and I are working on ways to protect it for generations into the future. To expose that fragile ecosystem to oil and gas drilling makes no sense. It is reckless policy. It is irresponsible. Our freshwater ecosystem is a powerful. competitive advantage for our economy and a priceless national and international resource that belongs to all the people. not to any special interest. For hundreds of years. even before the Northwest Territory was open. the Great Lakes have defined an entire region of our continent and the world. In the region. we see the Great Lakes as precious jewels. The administration sees another drilling platform. Please support the BoniorStupakKaptur amendment. Oil and water do not mix.

Lake Superior is a constant source of wonder for many of us in this country. It helped to shape our landscape. our climate. it supports our economy. and it enhances our quality of life. I oppose drilling not because we do not need to find additional energy resources. We do. But these lakes are just too valuable and too many families lives would literally be at risk without fresh drinking water. It is simply not worth the risk. We are making progress in using energy more efficiently. reducing our reliance on coal and natural gas through energy efficiency and technology. but we must work hard to make bigger investments in current programs to do more. Investments do not always have to cost money either. We can and we must reduce our consumption by supporting wind. solar power and renewable fuels. like ethanol. which we produce in Minnesota. Future generations depend on us not to jeopardize todays greatest natural resources. An oil spill or any related disaster on the shores of the Great Lakes would impact fresh drinking water for 35 million people. and for what? For less than 1 days worth of oil and natural gas. The Great Lakes are important to this Nation. They are important to my State. They are important to the families in this country. They have been crucial in our historical and economic development. Our communities continue to play a critical role in Minnesota. and water is a part of that. I urge my colleagues to protect todays drinking water for future generations.

Twenty percent of the worlds fresh water is contained in the Great Lakes. It is much too precious to risk for additional drilling. And what would that drilling get us? The existing 13 wells have produced enough over their lifetime to provide only approximately a quarter of 1 days use of natural gas in this country. and only approximately 2 percent of 1 days use of petroleum. At what cost? I cannot imagine what type of drilling would have to occur to make a serious dent in Michigans energy needs. Since receiving criticism for taking the hard road of production versus conservation. the Bush administration has tried to say nice things about conservation. But the facts are clear: the Bush budget proposed to cut the Department of Energys renewable energy and efficiency programs by almost 30 percent. It cut innovative technologies like wind. solar. and hydroelectric research by 50 percent. The American people clearly do not want to see a policy of drilling at all costs. and the people of Michigan do not want it either. I urge my colleagues to support this very excellent amendment.",

There should not be any controversy over this issue. The Great Lakes should not be put at risk just so energy companies can extract a few weeks supply of oil. It was with a certain amount of disbelief that I learned that Governor Engler and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources had proposed to lift a 1997 moratorium restricting new development of oil and gas drilling under the Great Lakes. I believe this proposal is shortsighted. The Great Lakes are a vital natural resource to Michigan. The Lakes are our States crown jewels. and the heart of Michigans multibilliondollar tourist industry. In addition. the Great Lakes contain 20 percent of the worlds fresh water. Why would we ever choose to place all this at risk? The environmental damage from an oil spill would be catastrophic. The amendment before the House today is only common sense. It would bar any funds in this bill from being used to expand oil and gas drilling beneath the Great Lakes. Mr. Chairman. the Great Lakes are an invaluable resource to the people of Michigan and. indeed. the entire country.

I do not know of anyone in the Congress who has been a better protector of the traveling public. and I want to commend him for his wisdom in sponsoring this bill and bringing it before the Congress today. Mr. Speaker. in the last 25 years. the Nation has made significant gains in child passenger safety. Since 1975. child restraint systems have saved the lives of more than 4.000 children involved in automobile crashes. During that time. the fatality rate for children has decreased steadily. however. the number of deaths has not dropped rapidly due to population increases and a doubling of highway travel. In 1999. 1.135 children. 10 years of age and under were killed. and 182.000 were injured in highway crashes. Child restraint systems are effective. In 1998. only 8 percent of all children under age 5 rode unrestrained. but they accounted for more than half of all childoccupant fatalities. Without doubt. the single most effective way to protect our children in the event of a crash is to ensure that all children are buckled up in their appropriate restraint system on every trip. H.R. 691 will help us do that. The bill will support State programs to educate the public on child restraints and help us continue to reduce the tragic toll of deaths and injuries of our children on the Nations highways. In fiscal year 2000. Mr. Speaker. the State of Pennsylvania received $323.000 in Child Passenger Protection Education Grant funds to establish child passenger safety fitting stations in all State police barracks and increase the awareness of rural and minority populations in the State. In fiscal year 2001. the State is using its funds to purchase 17 mobile fitting stations. fund child safety passenger safety courses. and develop new materials to promote child passenger safety among health and medical personnel.

In the last 6 years. welfare reform has produced some real successes. and now we have the opportunity to build upon these achievements. Unfortunately. the underlying bill does not do this. but the substitute does. For example. we now know that for single mothers with young children to go to work. we must ensure that quality and affordable child care is available. And we should also ensure that legal immigrants are afforded the same safety net as other working families. The substitute includes these important provisions but the bill does not. Mr. Speaker. the part of the bill I wish to address is the funding for abstinenceonly education. I directed a teen parent and pregnancy program as part of our local high school district in Santa Barbara. California. and for several years worked daily with teenagers struggling with these very issues. These teen parents were the first to urge abstinence to their peers. to their younger brothers and sisters. even though they did not use that word. But their message was all about knowledge. comprehensive sex education. They did not use that term either. but they did know the power it gives when information is not based on fear or incomplete and halftruths. Young people are quick to pick up on these halftruths and shoddy arguments. and then the trust is gone. This bill sets aside $50 million for unproven abstinenceonly programs that do not even ensure that the information they contain is truthful or medically accurate. And. unfortunately. some of these abstinenceonly programs use terror tactics to try to keep teens from having sex. they exaggerate the failure rates of condoms. and some federally funded programs denigrate women. suggesting that they are not as smart or as capable as men. The substitute would allow States the flexibility to support proven abstinencebased programs that are medically accurate. These comprehensive programs will help to reduce teen pregnancy and will give our young people real tools for success. So I urge my colleagues to learn from our teenage parents and support the substitute.",

This bill limits access to education. does not adequately increase child care for millions of needy families. and does not make poverty reduction a real goal of welfare reform. H.R. 4737 would double the amount of time required for a parent on welfare with children under the age of 6 to work from 20 hours to 40 hours a week. and yet we do not sufficiently increase child care funding to care for these children. What will happen to our children? We will have more latchkey kids at younger and younger ages because their parents are working without the child care they need. We know that these children are more at risk for future difficulties. crime. drugs and teen pregnancy. This goes totally counter to family values preached by so many. Making welfare recipients spend even more time away from home and their children makes it totally antifamily. It just does not make any sense. Real family values entails allowing parents on welfare to go to school to get better jobs and to take care of their families. Unfortunately. or fortunately. I have some experience in this area. I can tell my colleagues from personal experience that education does make a difference for those women on welfare. We must also educate young men and women to prevent unwanted pregnancies. not to mention HIV and AIDS. and yet the GOP welfare bill continues the dangerous abstinenceonly until marriage program. which will prohibit any mention of contraception. even in the context of preventing HIV and AIDS. For all these reasons and many. many more we must defeat H.R. 4737. We cannot continue to put our children at risk. This will be the beginning of the end for any hope for a successful future. Vote \"no\" on H.R. 4737.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I will limit myself here. The abstinenceonly education funds were first included as part of the 1996 welfare reform law. and something that I do not think has been said to date is that 49 of the 50 States have elected to participate in this program. During our hearing. we heard of a program taking place in MiamiDade County. Florida. where the lady told us that they have only a 1.1 percent teen pregnancy rate. A 1.1 percent teen pregnancy rate. By continuing this funding for another 5 years. we can encourage the development of more successful programs. It is really. really critically important. as has already been pointed out. I would like to accent that abstinenceonly programs do not. do not prohibit educators from discussing the facts about the effectiveness of contraceptives. the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. or any other topic that might be raised. The only requirement is that the use of contraceptives cannot be advocated. Only abstinence can. This is not a \"just say no\" type of a program. It is a program that is designed for the overall individual. It goes into character and all those dignity types of areas.",

There is only one thing that has done more to keep people in poverty than the old welfare system did: Mr. Speaker. I am talking about teen pregnancy. Statistically speaking. when lowincome teenage girls get pregnant. they are dooming themselves to a lifetime of poverty and they are dooming their kids to a lifetime of poverty. Now. some of them escape it and succeed despite the odds. but most do not. And. Mr. Speaker. there is only one way kids can avoid getting pregnant before they are ready. and that is to abstain from sex until they are married. Some of our liberal friends say it is unrealistic to expect kids to abstain from sex. Some even say that it is dangerous to teach abstinence. That tells me they do not believe in Americas kids. They expect them to fail. and when we expect a kid to fail. that kid probably will fail. Let us be honest. the only real way to prevent our kids from getting STDs is to teach them to abstain until marriage. Now. I know a lot of kids who are saving themselves for marriage. I know them. They are proud of it. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has a good program. and I urge support of the bill.",

I want to raise first the issue of rural development. since my colleague gave me an extra minute. Those of us who live in rural America are always reminding our colleagues that there are differences in terms of our infrastructure and our resources and our institutions. but yet we have the same aspirations as anyone else. E 1315 Now we have a welfare bill that indeed requires work. And by the way. work is good for anyone and most of us love to work because we enjoy doing something that gives us satisfaction. In addition. it allows us to bring income into our families. In rural areas. there are very few jobs. If mothers are forced to leave. we should have day care. In rural areas. there are few qualified day care centers. Also. if jobs are not available immediately nearby. we need transportation. Unless we speak to those issues that allow for rural areas to make up for that differential. this welfare bill is not adequate. Let me speak about another issue on which I have been working. and that is teenage pregnancy. Indeed I do not claim any expertise in that area. but it is an issue that I have been engaged in. For 10 years I have been talking about the fact if we want to give our young people an opportunity. we must give them productive. positive alternatives so they do not get involved in destructive activities. Abstinence does work. but it is not the only method. If Members are interested in teenagers. we will give them information that is based on science and also inspire them to believe in themselves and give them a reason to abstain. We should not say that they must have abstinence. If we are truly committed to our young people rather than ideology. we would do all of these things to make sure that they have a future.",

For many years this Congress only put dollars aside to teach safe sex. teaching our teenagers the proper way of putting on a condom. Fortunately. 6 years ago this Congress took control and said we will give the option to States and entities to have abstinenceonly programs. and we will begin to fund those. It is not a mandate. it is an option for these organizations. It gives them the opportunity. Since we have implemented this policy. teenage pregnancy has dropped. teenage sexually transmitted diseases have dropped. That is fantastic. yet anecdotal. evidence. Frankly. we have all talked to teenagers in our districts. and we have heard that they want a positive message and they want our support in abstaining from sex until married.

Congress was faced with a failing welfare program that did little to assist individuals in the transition from dependence on a government welfare checkto independence to earn a paycheck. For far too many. under the old Welfare program that American dream was out of reach. In response. the Republican Congress rose to the challenge and produced public policy with remarkable results that created hope and opportunity. In the past 6 years. the reformed Welfare program reduced poverty. child hunger. and dependency on government welfare checks for survival. Today we have a chance to build upon this success through improving our current welfare program through the passage of the Personal Responsibility. Work. and Family Protection Act. The challenge of making the transition from welfare to stable jobs is very difficult. Congress must make the commitment to ensure all Americans have a chance of reaching the American Dream. The actions Congress takes today will have a lasting impact as future generations will continue to break the cycle of welfare and enjoy brighter futures.",

Unfortunately. the bill before us today does not live up to its title and will actually undermine the successful reforms enacted in For several reasons this proposal does not merit Congresss approval. First of all. the bill would impose an almost $2.5 billion unfunded mandate on the state of California. Without providing the funds necessary to implement the new work requirement provisions in H.R. 4737. this attempt to reform welfare will fail. And these unfunded mandates could not come at a worse time for states struggling to balance their budgets. This proposal also fails to address the most rudimentary obstacles in attempting to move individuals from welfare to work. We will pay the price for the lack of emphasis on worker training and basic reading and writing skills. It is short sighted to believe welfare recipients will successfully make the transition to selfsufficiency without the necessary literacy skills. Removing vocational education from the current list of workrelated activities that satisfy the core work requirement in current law is an exceptionally bad idea and shortsighted idea. There is also inadequate funding for childcare. We cant expect to break the cycle of poverty. if we are not willing to commit the needed resources. For all of these reasons. I urge my colleagues to join me opposing H.R. 4737. the Personal Responsibility. Work. and Family Promotion Act of 2002.",

I object to the fact that without any hearings or markups in the Financial Services Committee. the bills superwaiver provision would authorize States. with approval of the HUD Secretary. to sweep away all of the rules and regulations that govern our Federal public housing and homeless programs. This is an outrageous usurpation of our committees authority. Just 4 years ago Congress enacted a comprehensive bill to reform our public housing laws. Provisions dealing with rent burdens. enhanced local flexibility. resident participation. and other key public housing issues were carefully developed over several years. Notably. the bill was enacted after the 1996 welfare reform bill was passed. and included many provisions designed to complement welfare reform. including eliminating work disincentives. Now. with a single sweep of the pen. all these provisions could be ignored under the \"superwaiver.\" This could jeopardize carefully crafted protections for the over 1 million lowincome families in public housing. Under the superwaiver. rent payments could skyrocket. families with small children could be evicted for technical violations of new rules. resident appeal procedures and lease protections could be wiped away. And. protections for use of housing funds for our Nations most vulnerable. the homeless. could be eviscerated. Worse. because this bill has never even seen the light of day within our committee. we cannot even be sure the extent to which existing public housing and homeless laws could be undermined. Representative FRANK and I offered an amendment to delete the applicability of the superwaiver to housing programs. Of course. the Rules Committee blocked debate on this and other amendments. This is a terrible way to do business. We ought to send the different sections of this bill back to the relevant committees for consideration the old fashioned wayhold hearings. then mark up the bill in subcommittee and committee.",

The Republican base bill. which does not allow for amendments. would increase poverty and its sequelae. instead of reducing it as it purports to do. This bill imposes massive new mandates and additional costs on states at a time when they are struggling and cannot absorb not one penny more of new costs. In light of the fact that 39 States and the territories are struggling to meet work requirements in an atmosphere of recession and lack of available jobs. this bill would create the scenario where precious resources are spent on fines and the safety net becomes full of holes. This countrys offshore areas. would be particularly negatively impacted. because of even less resources. and poor economic conditions with fewer jobs within geographical limitations. Even worse. Mr. Speaker. this bill tightens the vise on those trying to transition from welfare to work. It eliminates education from the list that count as work related activity and does not provide adequate resources for childcare. On the other hand it doubles the amount of hours that recipients are required to work. creating more hardship for mothers with children under school age. Mr. Speaker. there is a lot of conservative ideology represented here. Where is the compassion? The Democratic substitute would give States and territories more flexibility by giving them the option to require 40 hours if childcare and educational resources are available. but would only require 30 hours of work if not. The Democratic substitute would also remove the ban that prohibits states from serving legal immigrants. The Democratic substitute would also give the territories the tools they need to successfully transition people from welfare to work. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4737 is a set back. not forward. If the reactionary political climate of an election year precludes us getting a good bill. lets simply extend the current authorization for one more year. and lets sit down again next year and do it right.

They will have to raise taxes or cut services to compensate for the 5year. $11 billion State government cost of this onesizefitsall. heavyhanded Federal policy. Maine will need $56 million to meet the new work requirements. If this is welfare reform. our families cant take it. The bill requires mothers with children under 6 to double their required work week from 20 hours to 40 hours per week. For these mothers. this bill means less time with their children. and not enough money to cover expanded child care costs. It probably means at least two jobs for many mothers. because lowwage jobs are usually part time. For States like Maine. this bill reduces flexibility. For example. Maines successful \"Parents as Scholars\" program. which provides access to postsecondary education. has increased the wages and benefits of participants when compared to other strategies. But Maine would probably be forced to divert those dollars to other mandated work activities in order to meet the requirements of this bill. To all those wealthy individuals who came to Congress last year with their hands out. the Republican party said. \"Here are your tax cuts.\" To all those families who need a hand up to move from welfare to work. this Republican bill says get off welfare. but do it by yourself. with inadequate child care. longer work hours. and less vocational education. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and vote in favor of the Democratic substitute. The Democratic substitute would give States the option of raising the work requirement to 40 hours where adequate childcare and educational resources are available. allow States to credit education toward the work requirement. and increase childcare funding by $11 billion over 5 years.",

The airborne laser integrates a highpowered laser on a Boeing 747 aircraft. It is designed to protect our deployed troops from the threat of theater ballistic missiles. The Pentagon requested $153 million to address program shortfalls. The amendment reduces this request by $55 million. leaving an increase of $98 million. It is true that in the January time frame. the Air Force estimated the airborn laser shortfall only to be $98.5 million. but subsequent to that. as the chairman has pointed out. they have identified two additional areas that need $55 million. The committee has carefully scrutinized this request. and we believe that the failure to fund the additional cost growth would force the contractor to stop work on the program. Failure to fund the additional spares will likely lead to inefficient schedule disruptions that will increase costs further. Most importantly. we are pushing to get a real test in 2003 for this program. If we do not fund this supplemental request. that question of being able to get the test to see if this will work to protect our troops when they are deployed in the field will be jeopardized. I would just say to my colleagues. we may have a lot of debate here in Congress about national missile defense. but I think there is bipartisan consensus that we need theater missile defense in order to protect our deployed troops. We can give somebody a check. we can take care of their health care. we can take care of their pension. but we also have to take care of protecting their life.

The Navy requested an additional $375 million for shipdepot maintenance. but political appointees in the Pentagon and at the Office of Management and Budget reduced that amount to $200 million. Mr. Chairman. $375 million is not an arbitrary amount. It is absolutely essential to complete this years ship maintenance and overhaul requirements.

I think it is the responsibility. and that is why I went to the Committee on Rules last evening to ask for an amendment to be debated on the floor today. They did not make that amendment in order. But what I will be offering is legislation that does deal with a refund. If a consumer goes to Macys or a restaurant and is overcharged. they are going to seek a refund. Californians deserve it. They have been ripped off. and we seek to have this money returned to the good people of California.",

I believe it boils down to this: The drug companies of America like the system the way it is today. They want nothing to happen. The seniors of America are counting on us to stand up and do the right thing: Not privatizing Medicare with a private plan that sets up insurance HMOs which. by the way. was written in the House in part by the drug companies knowing that this is the approach that is least likely to lower prices but. rather. protecting. preserving. and modernizing Medicare. This is a bipartisan effort. I commend colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have stepped up to say we are going to make a downpayment on modernizing Medicare to cover prescription drugs. That is what this is. Everyone gets help. Everyones prices go down. And for those who need it the most. those who are the sickest. they will. in fact. receive comprehensive coverage. No premium. No deductible. They will get the help they need. I am proud to stand today with my colleagues. Senator GRAHAM. Senator SMITH. and others on both sides of the aisle who have put this together with AARP and with the senior groups in America to say the time has come. The time has come for us to place this downpayment on modernizing Medicare and move forward until we completely provide comprehensive Medicare coverage for all seniors and the disabled in this country. I cannot imagine why we would not want to keep this process going to get the bill in front of us. It can always be fine tuned. We can continue to work together. But today is yes or no on whether we proceed to help the seniors of America and stand with them. Stop talking about it. lets act together and let the seniors know that we are willing to provide the leadership necessaryall of us togetherto get this done. I thank the Chair.",

This is obviously a compromise. but great work has gone into this effort and it is important we do something for all those people who need help. I want to say a word about the underlying bill because while we are providing the prescription drug benefit. we need to make that benefit affordable. No. 1. and. No. 2. we need to do something about the cost of prescription drugs in this country. The Presiding Officer. Senator SCHUMER. led the way. along with Senator MCCAIN. in doing something about the cost of prescription drugs in this country in getting generic drugs on to the marketplace. providing competition. and bringing down the costs for all Americans. In the HELP Committee. Senator COLLINS and I. working with Senator SCHUMER and Senator MCCAIN. built on that work that had already been done and provided a way to deal with the problem of brand name drug companies abusing the patent process to keep generics out of the marketplace. What was happening was this: Brand name companies were filing frivolous patents. The result of filing those frivolous patents is the generics were not able to get into the marketplace. The brand names used the litigation process to keep generics out of the marketplace. What this underlying legislation does is to close those loopholes. It provides specifically for a mechanism to eliminate the use of frivolous patents to. in fact. give brand name companies protection when they have a real. new. creative. and innovative product. but at the same time it eliminates the patent and litigation abuses that have been occurring. It eliminates things such as brand name companies getting a patent on putting their pills in a brown bottle. Those are the kinds of abuses that have been occurring. In the past. they have kept generics out of the marketplace. What the underlying legislation will do is it will save $60 billion for American consumers over the next 10 years. It is critically important that we do this drug benefit. but it is also critically important that we do something about the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans.",

A week ago. the Republicans said no to the comprehensive program that was introduced by Senator GRAHAM and Senator MILLER that would have provided the comprehensive approach about which so many have talked. I have listened to my friends on the other side of the aisle. They are using a favorite technique. That is to misrepresent and distort what is before the Senate. and then differ with it. Senator GRAHAM has given the facts on this program. The basic issue before the Senate now. in the next few minutes. is whether we consider prescription drugs a priority for our senior citizens. If we vote with Senator GRAHAM and Senator SMITH. we are saying they are a priority. This bill is not going to solve all the problems. but it is a downpayment. It is a downpayment on those prescription drugs. Every one of us who is going to support that position is committed to coming back next year and the year after to make sure we have the comprehensive issue.

Seniors have listened to that every single year since the time we passed Medicare in 1965. Now is the time to do something about it.

We have completed a debate on proposals to provide prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. the most vulnerable sector of our population. and we have come up empty. I applaud my colleagues for their earnestness and conscientiousness as this issue was discussed on the Senate floor. but earnestness and conscientiousness do not help the senior citizen who cannot afford to pay for needed medications. I introduced a bill. the Prescription Drug Benefit Act of 2002. that would have provided an excellent benefit for Medicare beneficiaries by adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare Part B with no new premiums or deductibles. and I still believe that should be our goal. But at this point. we dont even have a consensus for a first step toward a Medicare prescription drug plan for seniors. Last week. I voted for the GrahamMiller plan. a comprehensive approach to this problem that. although not as good as my own bill. was a worthy compromise. It was defeated. Today. I voted for the GrahamSmith plan that would at least offer us a starting point toward a comprehensive prescription drug plan. It was defeated. I and all of my colleagues who are concerned about the welfare of our seniors are regrouping with an eye toward taking another run at this critical problem in the very near future. The seniors and the disabled still need their lifesaving medications. They still have to pay large amounts outofpocket for drugs. even though the legislation we passed today should help reduce the overall cost of pharmaceuticals for everyone. The percentage of the population covered by Medicare is rising. Medical advances are leading to important new drugs for various diseases. Our nations seniors cannot. and should not. be left behind in the race toward longer and healthier lives.

    "speech": "Mr. President. nearly 482.000 seniors in Arkansas desperately need a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Per capita. Arkansas has one of the poorest senior populations in the Nation. which means. more often than not. Arkansas seniors must choose between putting food on the table and buying much needed prescription medicines. I voted in favor of the GrahamSmithLincoln Medicare prescription drug compromise today. which has the full support of the AARP. because I believe in providing prescription drug assistance to as many people as possible and to those seniors who need it most. I regret. however. that it leaves out nearly 40 percent of Arkansas seniors and lacks measures to strengthen and protect Medicare. Rather. I believe that a universal benefit. accompanied by responsible Medicare reforms. is the most sensible approach to addressing the rising cost of drugs for our seniors and ensuring the longterm stability of the Medicare program. But most importantly. I am concerned about the impact of the GrahamSmithLincoln compromise on local pharmacies. Seniors need a Medicare prescription drug benefit just as much as they need access to their local pharmacies. particularly in rural states like Arkansas. The discount drug card established under the GrahamSmithLincoln compromise is a concept I opposed last week when I voted against the Hagel drug card amendment. Requiring pharmacies to accept discounts while doing nothing to reduce the price at which drugs are bought could force local pharmacies to foot the bill of a Medicare prescription drug amendment. This is simply not right. To help fix these problems. I filed an amendment to the GrahamSmithLincoln compromise which would have struck the drug discount card provisions in the bill as well as a provision giving special treatment for mail order pharmacies. If the GrahamSmithLincoln compromise garnered the 60 votes necessary for passage. I was prepared to offer my amendment so the Senate could have an open debate and vote on the impact of such legislation on local pharmacists. Since the GrahamSmithLincoln compromise was rejected. this debate will have to wait until another day. In the meantime. I will continue to work for a bipartisan solution that provides Medicare prescription drug coverage for all seniors. and particularly lowincome seniors. while also preserving access to local pharmacies.",

We know how necessary it is for the President to have this new Department. with the flexibility he needs to merge more than 20 agencies. From my perspective. I cannot figure out why the Majority has been filing cloture motions on some of these amendments. when I think they could make a motion to table instead. I am still trying to figure that out. I may need to get the Parliamentarian to explain what this is all about. But I can assure you. that after the time I have spent on this issue with many of my colleagues. including many on the other side of the aisle. we want this to move forward. We would like to have a vote up or down on the Presidents amended proposal. which is contained in the GrammMiller amendment. We would like to have a vote on the recommendations from Senators NELSON. BREAUX. and CHAFEE. and see where the Senate stands on that amendment. We have to move this along. We cannot go home. I think. without getting this done. I know this has gotten to be pretty partisan.

I assure the distinguished Senator from Nevada that we are not delaying this. We want to move forward. And I will certainly do anything I can to help cooperate in this regard.

First. she was there. as I recall. as I was. when Senator DASCHLE came into our meeting this morningthere were maybe seven or eight Senatorsand read the remarks. All of us were stunned and furious. We were just so upset that not a policy debate but. rather. a sort of belowthebelt hit was being made not only by political operatives but by the President himself when he said people are not for national security. I have been asked by reporters: Was this a calculated move? I said: No. you should have been there and just seen the reaction. I remember the junior Senator from California. the senior Senator from New York. and some others of us urged him to go to the floor and to just speak his mind. He was saying to others: Maybe I ought to reflect on it. No. you should speak what you think. I think it is clear. and I have been talking with people in my State. that the President has stepped over the line with these remarks. This weekend. I was asked by many people way to the left of me: Isnt the President. when he wants to go into Iraq. using politics? I said: No. I dont think so. I think he has been wanting to go into Iraq from the very beginning. Then for him to accuse Democrats of using politics. in my judgmentand I wonder what the Senator from California thinks because she has spoken in a heartfelt. compassionate wayI think the American people are fundamentally fair. and ugly tactics like that will backfire on their own. but I also believe it has to be pointed out because war is serious stuff and we need unity. We do not need political games. Senator INOUYE said it best. I just ask the Senator if she is finding the same thing in her State as mine. that people are not sure. they want some questions asked before we go into war. and people do not like one party accusing the other of not being patriotic or being less concerned about national security simply because they ask questions.

They are very much against what the President sent over. More importantly are my conversations with my constituents. They clearly are very pleased that Senator FEINSTEIN has made remarks regarding Iraq. and I have spoken out. I have received calls now because I raised a number of questions in the Foreign Relations Committee regarding working with our allies. working through the U.N.. asking: Is there a path to peace here? What I pointed out is in recent years. I have voted for two resolutions to go to war: One was to stop the genocide by Milosevic. that was with a Democratic President. and one with current President Bush to respond to the brutal. inhumane terrorist attack on 9/11 for which every single Democrat in this particular body voted. To me. it is not a question of will I ever vote for such action. It is a question of what is the best way to proceed. My constituents want to hear what I am thinking. I have been in Congress for 20 years. They do not want to see debates where one party is saying to another: You do not care about the American people. My friend is so correct. They look to us to engage in a rational debate. not to have oneline zingers as the President put out. This is not what they want. Then Ari Fleischer. who is the press secretary for the President. said this today: Its time for everyone to work well together to protect our national security. That was his remark after he was questioned about the Presidents statement. That is the point that Senator DASCHLE was making. but not as rhetoric. as fact. There is an expression.

Madame Wu did not shrink from her duties to her family or her country. While her husband was in jail. she not only served as a pillar for her family. but she ran for a seat in the national legislature and won. No obstacle affecting her body or her heart could deter her.

My own view is that it is conclusive that SnoweJeffords would not satisfy Buckley. that we are looking for an avoidance of a vagueness standard. that simply having a clearly identified candidate for Federal office and a time parameter would not meet the requirement of Buckley which talks about \" vote for\" or \"vote against.\" that in the long history of many cases since 1976. over a 25yearperiod. the best language which has come forward is the Furgatch language. I believe that. on its face. it passes constitutional muster. There are a lot of decisions by the courts throwing out legislation on the ground that the legislation is vague and. if legislation is vague. it doesnt satisfy requirements of due process of law. Many courts have struggled mightily for 25 years. and the only court which has come up with language is the Supreme Court of the United States. And as I say that. I know the Hornbook rule is you are supposed to not be able to tell anybody if the Supreme Court denies cert. But it is always mentioned the Supreme Court did not cert. and it is mentioned the Supreme Court does not cert because of the impossible inference. because if the Supreme Court did not like Furgatch. it would have taken cert. I know there is a contrary doctrine that says the Supreme Court is so busy one cannot draw an inference. but I think in a practical sense you can. So in 25 years of litigation and a lot of cases. the best that has evolved is this language which I submit to my colleagues is not vague when it says \"no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.\" That is not vague. But if we stand pat and pass this bill. there is a big risk of unconstitutionality. And if somebody has a way to eliminate vagueness more precisely. I am open. I yield the floor.",

Under the Senators latest suggestionif it was either/oryou might have a situation where you would not have the SnoweJeffords language but only the new language \"unmistakable. unambiguous.\" et cetera. which we have been discussing. If I am correct this is a constitutional problem in terms of vagueness. then we would be less likely to have that upheld than if it were coupled with what I believe is constitutionally permissible language under SnoweJeffords.",

We really cant tell. We just had an extensive debate as to whether SnoweJeffords language is constitutional. and whether Furgatch is constitutional. If we put both of them in. and we make a legislative record that we are looking for one or the other to be satisfactory. I believe that the language of severability means just that. If you have a long statute. and the Court strikes down one part of it saying it is wrong. it leaves the rest of it. If the rest of it passes constitutional muster. then it is constitutional. The severability issue really turns on constitutional doctrine as to whether the legislation makes sense if it is severed. The Court will strike it down if by striking down a certain clause the rest of it doesnt carry out congressional intent. Congress tries to avoid that by the severability clause. But putting in a severability clause isnt an absolute guarantee that the Court might not say it is nonseverable. notwithstanding the severability clause. because a part was stricken leaving the rest of it as unintelligible. or insufficient. or not really meaningful. But in this context if we say in this legislation we have SnoweJeffords. or Furgatch. and if one of them measures up. then the statute survives.",

Connecticut. Michigan. and elsewhere. Those letters urged $1.000 contributions to seemingly prestigious Pennsylvania Avenue addresses on behalf of lawyers purportedly for both George W. Bush and Al Gore. About the same time. thousands of similar letters offering coffee mugs for contributions of between $1.000 and $5.000 were sent to Democratic donors from New York to San Francisco. Clearly. one can see the potential for harm to citizens who are targeted in such fraudulent schemes. Unfortunately. the Federal Election Campaign Act does not grant specific authority to the Federal Election Commission to investigate this type of activity. nor does it specifically prohibit persons from fraudulently soliciting contributions. The FEC has asked Congress to remedy this. and the amendment I offer today is in response to this request.

This bill continues the practice in recent years of diverting affordable housing resources to nonhousing programs. Specifically. the bill rescinds $114 million in Section 8 funds. There are two problems with this. First. it is not clear that HUD will have sufficient Section 8 budget authority to meet all its obligations in the current fiscal year if this rescission is adopted. Secondly. even if there is not a problem in the current fiscal year. this rescission takes away over $100 million in budget authority that could otherwise be used to restore a portion of the billions of dollars of cuts in housing programs proposed in the Administrations fiscal year 2002 budget. The Administration justified these cuts as necessary to offset technical increases in Section 8 authority. It would be totally unjustified if the majority party brings a VAHUD appropriations bill to the floor next month which cuts housing funding. citing- rising Section 8 costs. while it diverts Section 8 funds today that could be used to restore those cuts. I would also like to point out that this bill adopts the Administration approach to resolving the FHA multifamily loan crisisraising premiums which will be passed along in the form of higher rents to working families. and supplementing that with $40 million in credit subsidy. While this means that the program will probably be back up again in 30 days or so. it is the wrong solution to the problem. First. the FHA shutdown was totally unnecessary. The Administration should have used the $40 million Congress appropriated last year to keep the program running. It is unreasonable that the Administration refused to use that $40 million. but is now requesting a new $40 million. Second. instead of raising premiums. we should have used a tiny portion of the billions of dollars in annual FHA profits as credit subsidy to keep the program running. without fee increases. Finally. I would note that this bill ignores the funding crises in public housing caused by the huge runup in utility costs. which have not been reimbursed under the federal operating subsidy. In so many ways. this bill is a disservice to the Nations housing needs.",

H.R. 2216 provides for a net increase in budget authority of $6.5 billion. This amount reflects appropriations of $7.9 billion in new budget authority and a rescission of $1.4 billion. The vast majority of the appropriations provided by this bill is related to national defense. The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2002. H. Con. Res. 83. revised the 302(a) allocations to the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2001 to accommodate this supplemental appropriations bill. providing up to $6.5 billion in nonemergency supplemental appropriations. The bill is within the revised 302(b) allocations to the Committee on Appropriations established by the budget resolution and therefore complies with section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act. [] 1515 This bill deserves our support. The Committee on Appropriations deserves our commendations for meeting our defense and domestic needs while staying within the levels agreed to by the Congress as part of the budget resolution. I compliment the chairman and the committee on doing so and I rise. as I say. in support of this H.R. 2216.",

Oregon. in the Klamath Basin. that includes also over into California. This aid is extraordinarily important. Saturday. the House Committee on Resources held a hearing in Klamath Falls that had to be moved to the fairgrounds because more than 2.000 people affected by this cutoff of the water turned out to hear what the Federal Government was doing. Mr. Chairman. as we have discussed. I greatly appreciate all the efforts of the chairman and that of his staff to expedite the delivery of those funds in the form of grants to the farmers that are so affected. As we have talked. however. this is literally a drop in the bucket in terms of the disaster magnitude there. Upwards of $200 million is what they estimate will be the problem. I wondered. Mr. Chairman. if it might be possible. recognizing this will not be the only vehicle going through this session of Congress. but if possible we could work to increase that disaster aid to these people whose fields are drying out and they are getting foreclosure notices today.",

It is designed to protect our deployed troops from the threat of theater ballistic missiles. The Pentagon requested $153 million to address program shortfalls. The amendment reduces that request by $55 million. leaving an increase of $98 million. It is true that in the January time frame this year. the Air Force estimated the airborne laser shortfall to be at $98 million. Thirtyfour million was part of cost growth. $64 million rephase efforts originally planned for out years. Since January. the Air Force has identified two additional areas of increased cost which total $55 million as follows: $30 million additional cost growth for the loss of suppliers. technical complexities. et cetera. $25 million additional spares to reduce testing risks. We have scrutinized these additional costs carefully and have determined that they are necessary to keep the program on track. Failure to fund the additional cost growth could force the contractor to stop work on the program. Failure to fund the additional spares will likely lead to inefficient schedule disruptions that will increase costs further. The airborne laser already has a very tight schedule for a 2003 lethal demonstration against a theater missile. This is an important program required to protect our troops from weapons of mass destruction. I strongly encourage the Members to vote no on this amendment.",

I cant believe any member of this chamber would argue that the Federal Government is so hard up for revenue that it would try to tax the very payment that it makes to someone whose home. business. and community it burned down. Let me summarize the events: The Park Service decided to start a firea socalled \"controlled burn.\" The Park Service didnt follow its own guidelines regarding when it is safe to conduct a controlled burn. They lit a fire when the rules were clear that they shouldnt. The fire raged out of control and burned 48.000 acres. It burned down hundreds of homes. and businesses. No dispute that this fire should never have been set. Congress passed a bill to compensate the victims for their losses. When Congress passed the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act we were assured that the FEMA payments to the victims of the Cerro Grande Fire would not be taxed under current law. Well. apparently there are some in the IRS who now have a different view. While it only took Congress 50 days from the day the fire was lit to the day legislation creating the claims process was signed into law. it has taken the IRS at least seven months to answer pretty basic questions. and the best they can offer is that people have extra time to file their income taxes. These victims should be paid. They should rebuild their lives and the IRS shouldnt be trying to tax the payments that are intended to put them back to the same place they were on the day before the Park Service lit the fire. I hope my colleagues will support me in expeditiously passing this bill. By Mr. MCCAIN (for himself. Mr.",

To that end. today I am introducing the Campaign Finance Integrity Act of 2001. My bill would: Require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their contributions flom individuals in the state or district in which they are running. Equalize contributions from individuals and political action committees. PACs. by raising the individual limit from $1000 to $2500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5000 to $2500. Index individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation. Reduce the influence of a candidates personal wealth by allowing political party committees to match dollar for dollar the personal contribution of a candidate above $5000. Require corporations and labor organizations to seek separate. voluntary authorization of the use of any dues. initiative fees or payment as a condition of employment for political activity. and requires annual full disclosure of those activities to members and shareholders. Prohibit depositing an individual contribution by a campaign unless the individuals profession and employer are reported. Encourage the Federal Election Commission to allow filing of reports by fax machines and other emerging technologies and to make that information accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours of receipt. Ban the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings. This is common sense campaign finance reform. It drives the candidate back into his district or state to raise money from individual contributions. It has some of the most open. full and timely disclosure requirements of any other campaign finance bill in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. I strongly believe that sunshine is the best disinfectant. The right of political parties. groups and individuals to say what they want in a political campaign is preservedbut the right of the public to know how much they are spending and what they are saying is also recognized.

Just a few short months ago. every member of the Republican caucus voted for protection for both Medicare and Social Security. What has occurred that would lead them now to forget Medicare? This is not a wise course. In the name of protecting Social Security. this amendment would cut Medicare. The sequester that is provided for in this amendment says. if we are on the edge of going into Social Security. cut Medicare. cut defense. It is a onetrick pony. It does not matter whether the deficiency was caused by a tax cut. by an economic downturn. or by excessive spending. the answer to each and every one of them is the same: cut spending. It does not matter if the problem was caused by too big a tax cut: cut spending. It does not matter if the problem was caused by an economic downturn. the answer is cut spending. It is not a balanced approach. The assertion that there is no Medicare surplus simply does not fit the facts. This is the report of the Congressional Budget Office. On page 19. under the table \"Trust Fund Surpluses.\" it shows Social Security in surplus. it shows Medicare Part A in surplus. it shows Medicare Part B in rough balance. The argument that the Senator from Ohio is making is that because we have chosen. as a Congress. to fund Part B. in part by general fund transfers. that that means Medicare is in deficit. That is not the case. That is not the definition of the Congressional Budget Office. that is not the definition of the Office of Management and Budget. All of them assert there is a surplus in Part A and rough balance in Part B. We. as a Congress. have made the determination to finance Part B. by premiums in part. by general fund transfer in part. This is not an amendment we should adopt.",

Now. as of 3 oclock this afternoon. according to the Secretary of the Treasury. the public debt to the pennyand anybody can read it on the Internetthe debt now. instead of being a surplus. has increased since the beginning of the fiscal year to $36 billion in the red. In other words. we dont have the $41 billion for a rebate. We have to go out and borrow it. Common sense says that rather than going out and borrowing money and throwing it to the winds. increasing the debt. the public would prefer that we pay down the debt. At least that is what we tell them we are doing. If you look on the screen on channel 2. the Republican channel says \"abolishes a tax rebate.\" \"President Bush and Congress promise to the American people ...\" They didnt promise it. It was my amendment. I promised. as the financial world advised me. that it should apply to all taxpayers. What they have done is broken my promise. Nothing is in this bill for the 25 million payrolltax payers. In other words. you and I. Mr. President. will get a rebate. unless you vote for my amendment. But the payrolltax payers. such as Dicky FlattI dont know where the Senator from Texas is. but Dicky Flatt. the fellow who \"pulls the wagon and pays the taxes. and builds the country. and sits around the kitchen table\" gets nothing. Now. come on. If there is a conscience around here. lets talk sense. Save that $41 billion. We need it for defense. We need it for education. We have increased education spending to $25 billion a year. $250 billion over 10 years. We need it for prescription drugs.

That is barely over 1 month ago. My opposition to the amendment is based on both procedural and substantive grounds. On the first problem the amendments procedural problems. it is clear that. if adopted. this amendment will cause the underlying supplemental appropriations bill to violate the origination clause of the U.S. Constitution. If sent to the House. the bill would certainly be \"blue slipped.\" So. this amendment. if adopted. kills the supplemental. The second problem is the substance of the amendment. This amendment would repeal all of the retroactive marginal rate reductions in the recently passed tax bill. Those rate cuts are based principally on the new ten percent bracket for the first $6.000 of income for single taxpayers and $12.000 of income for married couples. The retroactive new ten percent bracket is the basis for the advance refund checks of $300 for a single person and $600 for a married couple. The Hollings amendment stops these checks dead. A vote for the Hollings amendment is a way to say no to American taxpayers who now expect to receive refund checks. A vote for the Hollings amendment is a vote against the stimulus in the tax bill we just passed.",

I do not believe you will find one economist of renown and repute in the United States who will say in the middle of this downturn we should increase taxes. Ask somebody. I asked a bunch of them. They said this might not be the greatest tax plan. but cut the taxes and leave it alone. I say to my friend. Senator HOLLINGS. he did a good thing when we had the budget resolution before us. He was ahead of us. He said put more of it in the early years. We went off to conference and followed his admonition. Now he thinks that is too much.

The additional LIHEAP funds are offset by an administrative cut in the Department of Defense to which Mr. INOUYE has very ably addressed his remarks in opposition thereto. I am a strong supporter of LIHEAP. it helps many lowincome households facing rising fuel costs. pay to heat their homes. However. both the Housepassed and the Senate committeereported version of this supplemental already recommend an additional $300 million for LIHEAP. which is double the amount recommended in the Presidents budget request. The committeereported bill brings the fiscal year 2001 LIHEAP appropriation to $2 billion. and with the carryover funds from the prior year. funds available for LIHEAP would total $2.155 billion in fiscal year 2001. This compares to $1.844 billion in fiscal year 2000an increase of $311 billion. I commend the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. He makes a very compelling argument. Ordinarily I would want to support him in the position he has taken. However. the committeereported supplemental. as I have already indicated. is a balanced bill. it is a fair bill. While I would like to provide additional resources for energy assistance to lowincome people in the country. I believe the best way to quickly get supplemental LIHEAP funding to members in need is to approve the committee bill without this amendment so that the bill can be more immediately sent to conference and on to the President for his signature.

    "speech": "I wish to advise my colleagues that in crafting this supplemental bill we considered two criteria. and both of them were requested by the Republican administration. requested by the Department of Defense. First. any program receiving supplemental funding must be able to execute this funding during the current fiscal year. The current fiscal year ends in 21/2 months. just a few days away. Second. that the funding could not wait until fiscal year 2002. It is the view of President Bush that the supplemental request has satisfied this objective. I believe the modest changes made by the committee have improved this measure. increasing readiness and health care funding by $229 million. I will remind the Senate that from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal year 2001. the Congress added $49 billion to the DOD budget. much of it for various programs that concern the distinguished Senator from Missouri. in some cases operation and maintenance funds appropriated for the same activities identified in the supplemental request. such as spare parts. base operations. and depot maintenance. My point is. the Defense Subcommittee has a demonstrated record of considering both the funded and the unfunded requirements of the Department before marking up a piece of legislation. The funding provided in this bill. most respectfully. I believe meets the urgent needs of the military within the funding constraints set by the budget resolution for fiscal year 2001 approved by this body. This act avoids emergency spending to demonstrate fiscal restraint. Much of the funding proposed by this amendment could not be spent responsibly in 21/2 months. The Department would struggle to obligate the funds before the end of the fiscal year. Some would even be obligated to cover workload at the maintenance depots that would carry over to next year in violation of the Departments own restrictions. I point out to the Senator from Missouri that the Appropriations Committee has addressed programs that he seeks to fund with his amendment. Specifically. runway repairs for the Masirah Airfield in Oman are addressed in the military construction section. The committee has addressed the Armys second destination transport costs. Those funds were reduced in the bill passed by the House. It seems that the unfunded requirement list submitted to the Senator is currently outdated. So for all the above reasons. Madam President. I therefore must oppose this amendment.",

Right before we broke for the Fourth of July recess. I joined with my colleague. JIM INHOFE from Oklahoma. in writing to both the chairman and the ranking member to express to them our concern on behalf of our constituents. During the winter of 2001. our home States of Arkansas and Oklahoma suffered through some of the most devastating storms in recorded history. On December 29. 2000. President Clinton declared a major disaster for our States. triggering the release of Federal funds to help people and communities recover from the severe ice storms that had blanketed our home States. Unfortunately. the assistance provided to date has not been sufficient in getting our communities back on their feet. Farmers. ranchers. and timberland owners have been hardest hit. These ice storms added more than 10 times the normal amount of downed timber on the ground in Arkansas Ouachita National Forest. This year. Arkansas and Oklahoma have the potential to have one of the worst fire seasons in our history. With the massive amount of fuel on the ground. wildfires will burn extremely hot and fast. which will make it difficult to control or to contain. With the funding outlined in the emergency supplemental bill. our residents can complete the cleanup effort while also working to prevent massive forest fires this fall. It would not be possible without the wonderful bipartisan working relationship of these two gentlemen who have worked steadfastly with both of our delegations to make sure we can provide our residents with what they need in order to keep our families. our forests. and certainly our communities safe.

We have dropped the two worst provisions from the administration proposal. the illegal use of foreign evidence and the pretrial restraint provision. I commend the gentleman from Wisconsin . my chairman. who has worked night and day on this matter. and I think that in the overall. we have had good cooperation. The measure before us corrects unconstitutional immigration provisions. We have corrected the immigration provision that allows indefinite detention without evidence. We have modified or narrowed any number of other controversial provisions. more than a couple dozen. We have added a 4year sunset provision for most of the surveillance operations. We have added a new Inspector General for Civil Liberties and Civil Rights inside the Department of Justice. We have new Federal tort relief for improper government release of wiretap information. We have added new resources to ease the delays in patrolling and protecting the northern border. and we have immigration relief for persons being sponsored by the victims of those in the September 11 attack.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 4 minutes. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the legislation. particularly the provisions in title III which would represent the most comprehensive antimoney laundering legislation which the House has considered in more than a decade. The legislation gives the administration important new tools with which to wage a global financial war on terrorism. and to starve Osama bin Laden and others like him of the funding needed to commit their acts of evil. The bill that passed the House last week by a 412 to 1 vote has in my view been improved in conference with the other body. The legislation targets the specific channels used by terrorists to finance their operations in this country and globally. including bulk cash smuggling. international wire transfers to and from foreign banks. and using informal black market banking systems. such as the ancient network known as hawala. The bill also establishes a framework for an unprecedented publicprivate partnership that will have as its primary objective the identification. reporting. and disruption of financial transactions related to money laundering generally and terrorist activity specifically. Finally. the legislation gives the Secretary of the Treasury. in consultation with other government agencies. the power to impose countermeasures aimed at combatting overseas money laundering threats. particularly those emanating from socalled offshore secrecy havens. It has often been said that an effective international regime for thwarting money laundering and disrupting terrorist financing is only as strong as its weakest link. As long as there are jurisdictions that offer noquestionsasked banking and exert little or no regulatory oversight of their financial services sectors. international efforts to impede the flow of dirty money will never fully succeed. With this legislation. we take a critical step toward smoking terrorists and other criminal organizations out of the offshore financial bunkers that for too long have offered them safe haven. The money laundering portion of this legislation was introduced in the House on October 3. marked up by the Committee on Financial Services on October 11. and passed by the House on October 17. Obviously. to move such complex and farreaching legislation through the process so quickly requires an extraordinary level of bipartisan cooperation. In that regard. I want to pay special tribute to the committees ranking member. the gentleman from New York",

We can do that. Title III of the PATRIOT Act provides the United States absolutely essential weapons in our fight to disrupt terrorist funding. Title III provides a comprehensive set of tough new antimoney laundering laws and strengthens existing antimoney laundering laws. The bill incorporates the legislation that I introduced in the last Congress and early in this Congress giving the Secretary of the Treasury increased authority to block transfers of funds into the United States financial system from foreign banking systems that are easily exploited by terrorists and criminal organizations because those foreign jurisdictions have weak or nonexistent antimoney laundering regimes. We have evidence indicating that bin Laden took advantage of weak regulatory systems overseas to funnel money through U.S. banks to his associates in the United States. money that was used to finance the September 11 attacks. We cannot allow the worlds bank secrecy havens to become the port of entry into the United States banking system for terrorist funds. But. so long as some foreign banks are allowed to hide the identity of terrorists and narco lords. the legitimate global banking system will be vulnerable to exploitation by these groups. Our legislation. incorporated now in the PATRIOT Act. increases the power of the government to track terrorist and criminal money kept in offshore secrecy havens. We cannot succeed alone. All nations must have strong antiterrorist and antimoney laundering laws. The provisions of our bill give the United States new tools and leverage in our efforts to raise global antimoney laundering standards.",

I want to applaud Senator MURRAY and Senator SHELBY for their efforts to craft a commonsense solution on this issue. Their provision would ensure strong safety requirements and would be consistent with our obligations under NAFTA. As most people are well aware. the last Administration delayed opening the border to Mexican trucks because of serious safety concerns. Indeed. numerous reports have documented these concerns failing brakes. overweight trucks. and uninsured. unlicensed drivers to name just a few. The Department of Transportations most recent figures indicate that Mexican trucks are much more likely to be ordered off the road for severe safety deficiencies than either U.S. or Canadian trucks. While a NAFTA arbitration panel has ruled that the United States must initiate efforts to open the border to these trucks. we need to be clear about what the panel has said. The panel indicated. and I quote: -the United States may not be required to treat applications from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as applications from United States or Canadian firms.... U.S. authorities are responsible for the safe operations of trucks within U.S. territory. whether ownership is United States. Canadian. or Mexican.\" Moreover. U.S. compliance with its NAFTA obligationsand again to quote the panel: \"would not necessarily require providing favorable consideration to all or to any specific number of applications\" for Mexican trucks so long as these applications are reviewed \"on a casebycase basis.\" In other words. the U.S. government is well within its rights to impose standards it considers necessary to ensure that our highways are safe. The Administration has suggested that it is seeking to treat U.S.. Mexican. and Canadian trucks in the same waybut we are not required to treat them in the same way. Thats what the NAFTA panel said. With Mexican trucks. there are greater safety risks. And where there are greater safety risks. we can impose stricter safety standards. In addition to safety. we must also be concerned about the effect on our environment. I am cosponsoring an amendment by Senator KERRY to ensure thatconsistent with the NAFTAopening our border to Mexican trucks does not result in environmental damage.",

If there is one consistent complaint I have had in a lifetime of public service to my constituents. it is about safety on our roadways. How many times over the course of three decades have the people of Florida said to me as their elected representative that they saw this or that safety violation or they were concerned about how the truck suddenly cut them off or that they saw a truck spewing all kinds of emissions. If we then allow new lower standard Mexican trucks on American roadways. not even to speak of the lower safety standards that have been articulated by the Senator from North Dakota. what about the environmental standards? What about all of the emissions that will be coming from these trucks that we dont allow from our own trucks? Are we not concerned about our environment? Are we not concerned about global warming? Are we not getting ready to seriously address the mileage standards of automobiles and SUVs in order to try to reduce the emissions into the atmosphere to try to do something about global warming? Here we are about to address an amendment that is going to allow for lower emission standards for Mexican trucks.

Mr. GRAMM. my good friend. continues to define this issue as one about identical treatment of Mexican trucks. U.S. trucks. and Canadian trucks. Unfortunately. for my good friend from Texas. this is not about creating a rubberstamp approach to trucks entering our country and driving on our highways. This is about providing an approach tailored to the outofservice rates we see in Mexican trucks. Unfortunately. for the position put forth by my good friends from Texas and Arizona. under NAFTA. we have the right and we have the obligation to provide for safety on our highways in the United States and to regulate Mexican trucks entering this country as long as such regulations are \"no greater than necessary for legitimate regulatory reasons such as safety.\" This language came from the arbitration panel. The MurrayShelby provision is clearly within the legitimate safety interests that we have an obligation to regulate in this country. Also. unfortunately. I believe. for my colleague from Texas. his argument that the MurrayShelby provision violates NAFTA. violations of NAFTA are not judged by the Senate or even the administration. Alleged violations of NAFTA are ruled on by an arbitration panel. That is part of the agreement. His contention that NAFTA would be violated does not make it so. If you want to talk about discrimination. lets talk about discrimination against the American driver. Nothing in NAFTA should be misread to require that we give Mexican drivers a pass on safety standards while we strip our drivers of their licenses for infractions that may be honored in Mexico or which the Senators amendment tells us that we should ignore because to do otherwise would violate a treaty that I never supported. This is about enforcing the safety regulations of the United States of America. That is within the purview of NAFTA. as it would be for the Mexican Government to do likewise. At the proper time.

    "speech": "Mr. President. we have a colloquy we are prepared to enter into. In the context of this. last year we passed a bill on the issue of sex trafficking. It was groundbreaking legislation for this body. groundbreaking legislation for around the world. Its effort and focus was to get at the people who are trafficking. generally. young women and children for the purposes of prostitution. It is a global phenomenon. About 700.000 are trafficked to different places from different countries around the world each year. about 50.000 into the United States. We increased the penalties for people who are involved in trafficking. We have an annual report coming out from the Governmentthe first one came out this year. It was citing the problems of trafficking taking place. The colloquy we are entering into today is to get the initial office up and running at the State Department and intends for funding in the foreign operations bill. Mr. President. I would like to engage in a colloquy with Senator WELLSTONE on the topic of appropriations to combat international trafficking in human beings. I know that Senator WELLSTONE and other members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. as well as the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee. are greatly concerned about human trafficking. which impacts approximately 1 million people annually worldwide. Last year. this body unanimously passed legislation. the Trafficking Victims Protection Act which included an authorization of over $30 million from the foreign operations budget to address three principle components of antitrafficking: law enforcement. prevention. and victim assistance. The bill allocates only $10 million for law enforcement related to human trafficking. and thus is $20 million shy of the hopedfor appropriation of $30 million for Fiscal Year 2002 which was passed by the House. Given this shortfall. I hope that the State Department will spend more funds than those earmarked in this foreign operations appropriations bill. Furthermore. the Congress expects. as expressed through the trafficking legislation. that it will be combated worldwide through both enforcement and prevention programs. that is. sex trafficking could be combated worldwide. and that the trafficking victims would be assisted. Is it your understanding. Senator WELLSTONE. that the State Department and other relevant agencies and departments would dedicate and spend funds substantially over the $10 million presently allocated in this appropriation?",

The U.S. government is responding. but I am concerned that our response though wellintentioned. is both underfunded and undercoordinated. I believe that approximately $15 million is currently being spent to address human trafficking in the overall State Department budget. but it is not at all clear to me that activities are being coordinated among departments and agencies or that the results are being optimized. I believe that the State Department should work this year to dedicate not less than the $30 million authorized in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. and that this funding would be distributed to all three prongs including law enforcement. victims assistance. and trafficking prevention activities. I am very optimistic that the newly established office to combat trafficking at the State Department will bring some transparency and coordination to these activities. Im sure that both of us. as well as other members. will be watching for this to happen. To assist us all in monitoring progress. I will seek to add language to the statement of the managers to the conference report asking the State Department to report back to us next spring regarding plans and funding allocations for trafficking. Again. this is an important issue that certainly warrants more than $10 million and I believe there are ample funds in this bill to enable the State Department to meet the authorized levels.",

We understand that the trafficking budget for Fiscal Year 2002 is underfunded by at least $20 million in relation to the authorization. However. once the office is fully up and running next year. I believe that everyone is committed to seeing a full appropriation for Fiscal Year 2003 for the activities needed to combat trafficking worldwide. This amount should be not less than $33 million for Fiscal Year 2003. in addition to the other amounts authorized under HHS. Labor. and CJS appropriations legislation. In closing. we expect a full appropriation for Fiscal Year 2003. without which. worldwide trafficking cannot be effectively challenged.

    "speech": "Madam President. HIV/AIDS has become a worldwide pandemic. More than 16 million people have died of AIDS. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization. WHO. have estimated that over 32.4 million adults and 1.2 million children around the world are already living with HIV. Half of all people who acquire HIV become infected before they turn 25 and typically die of AIDS before their 35th birthday. The overwhelming majority of people with HIV live in the developing world. and that proportion is likely to grow even further as infection rates continue to rise in countries where poverty. poor health systems. and limited resources for prevention and care fuel the spread of the virus. SubSaharan Africa bears the brunt of HIV and AIDS. with close to 70 percent of the global total of HIVpositive people. Over 14 million Africans have already been claimed by the disease. leaving behind shattered families and crippled prospects for development. There have also been recent reports of growing problems in China. India. and elsewhere. Of course. the United States is not immune to this virus. and its spread globally only contributes to risks in America. It is estimated that approximately 90 percent of people in subSaharan Africa do not know if they are HIV infected or not. They have no means of gaining this vital knowledge so that they can protect themselves and others. Thus. testing is a critical aspect of the effort to stop the further spread of HIV/AIDS. However. one must be careful that tests are appropriate to the regions where they are used. In developing regions served by USAID. tests should be fast. accurate. simple. designed to assist those providing counseling. and have no need for labs or refrigeration. The importance of testing cannot be overstated. Early detection of HIV/AIDS might enable treatment to be more effective. We must do all we can to control and stop the spread of this dreaded virus. and I urge USAID to seek to develop rapid tests that serve this purpose.",

This amendment goes in absolutely the opposite direction. Mr. Chairman. the bill before us. as has been noted. does improve our Nations schools without vouchers. It includes several additional options for students in schools that fail to improve. including public school choice. access to afterschool supplemental tutoring services. In addition. the schools that fail to improve will be subject to consequences. That may include turning the school into a charter school or a takeover by the State. These provisions ensure that no child will be left behind in a failing school. and that scarce educational resources will be used effectively and efficiently to improve schools. and I want to stress this. for all students. not a small. select few. If this amendment passes. our ability to help public schools improve will be significantly hindered. It will be taking money away from the system. and even worse. the vast majority of the students will be left behind in failing public schools. How can we in good conscience select a few people from the failing schools to receive vouchers and leave the rest of the children behind? While. I am not a lawyer. aside from the unfairness of this. I would also say that if this amendment were ever to pass and this were in the bill. I am very confident that there would be court cases denying this because of discrimination and the limitations on the voucher system. This would then ultimately become an \"entitlement.\" The bottom line is that vouchers will reduce financial support for the vast majority to support only a select few and will definitely open up significant legal obstacles.

In fact. the Department of Education report shows that if required to accept special needs students. 85 percent of the private schools said they would not even participate in a voucher program. It is wrong to divert critical funding from our public schools. especially when all children will not have equal access. Now. in the areas. the cities that have had voucher programs like Milwaukee and Cleveland. the effectiveness has been inconclusive. at best. in terms of the results for the student achievement. However. what these cities have shown is that vouchers have led to greater class and race segregation in the classrooms. they are draining significant financial resources from public schools. and are primarily serving students already in the private school system.

I rise today in strong support of the Armey amendment. which restores all private school choice provisions back into H.R. 1. We are about to start testing our schools to gauge their success at educating our children. But what is the impetus for them to change if parents cannot take their children to better schools? Many of Americas children are stuck in failing schools and are being deprived of a better future because they have nowhere else to go. This amendment provides the means for parents to rescue their children from failing schools and send them to institutions that will successfully equip them for the future. School choice is the heart of this educational reform. and it is successful as Milwaukees school choice program has proven. Yet opponents of school choice are kowtowing to teacher unions and thus sacrificing the future of our children on the altar of politics. Support the Armey amendment and rescue our children from failing schools that are depriving them of successful lives.",

Public education is the backbone of our country. It is why we are a great Nation. Public education is available to all. It does not discriminate. and it must be strengthened. not weakened. Why is it that voucher supporters go on and on about our poorperforming public schools and do not have a plan to make all schools the best in the world? Instead. they support vouchers that take precious education dollars out of our public school system and give them to private and religious schools. I have no quarrel with private schools. but we cannot forget that private schools are allowed to selfselect their student body. while public schools educate all students. Mr. Chairman. I am proud to speak up for public education in America. Sure. it is not perfect. Democratic amendments would have helped in this bill. amendments that were not made in order. These amendments would have improved the public school system by reducing class size and repairing old school buildings. This amendment does not improve public education. It should be defeated.

It has been my pleasure. as a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. to work with them on this bill. as well as on the defense portions of the recently passed Fiscal Year 2002 Emergency Supplemental Bill. H.R. 4775. They certainly do a masterful job of setting priorities and balancing competing needs. I am also pleased that the Appropriations Committee chose to specifically provide $90 million in the Fiscal Year 2002 Emergency Supplemental bill to accelerate the depot modernization period of the USS Scranton at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard from Fiscal Year 2003 to Fiscal Year 2002. as it will result in dramatically improved fleet readiness. In addition. it will free up $90 million in Fiscal Year 2003. which had been programmed for the USS Scranton. to be used for other U.S. Navy critical submarine requirements. This could include returning back to Fiscal Year 2003 the important USS Annapolis depot modernization period at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. which the Navy was recently forced to slip from Fiscal Year 2003 to Fiscal Year 2004. because of a Navy funding shortfall. I direct a question to my two friends. the Chair and the Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Is it the Subcommittees understanding that the appropriation of the additional $90 million to accomplish the USS Scranton depot modernization period in Fiscal Year 2002. now gives the U.S. Navy flexibility to allocate the Fiscal Year 2003 USS Scranton funds to meet other critical submarine requirements?",

The Field PackUp unit. or FPU. is a containerized storage system that is 100% strategically and tactically mobile that far exceeds the current storage bins we use to transport materiel across the country and around the world. Senator Inouye. as you are well aware. one of the greatest factors in determining how quickly the U.S. military can deploy to a theater in order to respond to a threat is the simple fact that it can take several months to transport the materiel our troops need to succeed. The FPU will reduce that transportation time frame. decrease the logistics footprint. and allow the military to move swiftly and efficiently. In turn. these logistical efficiencies will save millions of dollars each year. The 3rd Infantry Aviation Brigade at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia conducted a field test between the FPU and currently used storage bins. The 3rd Infantry Brigade determined that if the entire Brigade deployed to Kuwait. 2 C5s would be needed using the FPU. Using traditional storage bins. 8 C5s would be necessary to mobilize to Kuwait. The FPUs would save at least $3.000.000 per deployment. according to the 3rd Infantry Brigade. I am concerned. however. that the Army has not dedicated funds toward this transformational program that will greatly reduce the logistics footprint and save millions of dollars each year. Last year. the Senate appropriated $5.000.000 for the FPU. but neither the House nor Senate funded the program this year. Senator Inouye. I know you are a champion of transformation. and I hope you would be willing to consider the utility the FPU could provide to our Armed Forces.",

I want to thank and commend the gentleman from Iowa . the gentleman from Ohio . the gentleman from Virginia . and the gentleman from New York . and the other sponsors for developing and moving this important legislation. In the last couple of decades. gambling has exploded across this country. both legal and illegal forms of gambling. While many of us are concerned about legal gambling and its impact on society. this bill is about illegal gambling. The Internet has made it possible to gamble away your money to offshore criminals right from your bedroom. Millions of Americans send these crooks their money. and up until now. the States have been powerless to do anything about it. With this bill. we solve the problem. It may be impossible to keep illegal gambling sites off the World Wide Web. but it is entirely possible to prevent American credit cards companies from completing these transactions that these crooks need to make their money. and that is what this bill does. It does nothing to roll back legal gambling in this country. This is entirely about activities that are already against the law and need to be stopped. Some Americans do not seem to have discretion not to do this. this will help keep the money out of the hands of illegal people running these gambling sites. and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.",

I would like to thank the gentleman from Iowa for his work. the ranking member. the gentleman from New York . the gentleman from Virginia . and others for their leadership. The main reason I am here today is that I am really interested in young people. and I am interested in sports gambling. and of course. Internet gambling has really lead to an explosion of gambling of intercollegiate athletics. and that is one reason why the NCAA. the NFL. and Major League Baseball all support this legislation. College students often run up huge credit card debts on these sites. and this is involved with sports betting. According to the Federal Trade Commission. Internet gambling sites are advertising on Web pages normally visited by children. A child cannot gamble in a casino or race track or any other establishment because of age limits. but some young people are using parents or their own credit cards on these sites. One really alarming statistic I want to mention: it is estimated that 1.1 million adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 are pathological gamblers. This is a higher percentage than adults by age group. Young people become addicted to alcohol. drugs. and gambling more quickly than adults because of psychological and physiological immaturity. So I believe this is especially pernicious and particularly dangerous. and I urge support of this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I oppose H.R. 556. the Unlawful Internet Gambling Funding Prohibition Act. Although this bill is entitled a \"prohibition\" act. it is really an authorization act. Section 3 of the bill provides a carveout for transactions with businesses licensed or authorized by States. It provides exemptions that. in essence. would allow States to license new Internet gaming operations for lotteries. horse tracks. and corporate gambling operations. The House Judiciary Committee rejected a similar provision in July when it adopted an amendment to delete all authorizations for interstate Internet gaming. Although the bill grants States these exemptions. it does not provide Tribal governments with the same exemptions. I would not be standing here today. in opposition to this bill. if there were a flat prohibition on internet gaming. But that is not what this bill does. The bill gives an advantage to private gaming enterprises. It does not treat tribal governments as equals. Just when we think that the centuries of mistreatment and discrimination are ending. something comes up to show us that they havent. We are learning that the more things change. the more they stay the same. Once again. Congress is trying to put tribal governments at a disadvantage. And once against. I will stand up and defend the sovereignty of tribal governments! I will stand up and make sure that our government lives up to its trust responsibility! Gaming provides the financial resources that tribes need to survive and to bring economic development to their people. It provides the resources that tribal governments need to provide health. education and hope to their people. It is the lifeblood of our Native American brothers and sisters! I will not stand by and watch as Congress puts tribes behind the eightball. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on H.R.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. H.R. 556 limits the ability of individual citizens to use bank instruments. including credit cards or checks. to finance Internet gambling. This legislation should be rejected by Congress since the federal government has no constitutional authority to ban or even discourage any form of gambling. In addition to being unconstitutional. H.R. 556 is likely to prove ineffective at ending Internet gambling. Instead. this bill will ensure that gambling is controlled by organized crime. History. from the failed experiment of prohibition to todays futile \"war on drugs.\" shows that the government cannot eliminate demand for something like Internet gambling simply by passing a law. Instead. H.R. 556 will force those who wish to gamble over the Internet to patronize suppliers willing to flaunt the ban. In many cases. providers of services banned by the government will be members of criminal organizations. Even if organized crime does not operate Internet gambling enterprises their competitors are likely to be controlled by organized crime. After all. since the owners and patrons of Internet gambling cannot rely on the police and courts to enforce contracts and resolve other disputes. they will be forced to rely on members of organized crime to perform those functions. Thus. the profits of Internet gambling will flow into organized crime. Furthermore. outlawing an activity will raise the price vendors are able to charge consumers. thus increasing the profits flowing to organized crime from Internet gambling. It is bitterly ironic that a bill masquerading as an attack on crime will actually increase organized crimes ability to control and profit from Internet gambling. In conclusion. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 556 violates the constitutional limits on federal power. Furthermore. laws such as H.R. 556 are ineffective in eliminating the demand for vices such as Internet gambling. instead. they ensure that these enterprises will be controlled by organized crime. Therefore I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 556. the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.",

Mr. Speaker. it is true that from the very first moment that we began the movement for bankruptcy reform. farmers in Chapter 12 were always one of the priorities. and not a day passed in the formation of the new bankruptcy reform bill that we did not insist that the final version that we were going to pass in this House and hopefully in the Senate and sign into law would contain Chapter 12 permanency for our farmers. What happened was that even though we made measured progress by passing the bankruptcy reform bill overwhelmingly in the House and overwhelmingly in the Senate at different times. the conference that was then formed never came to fruition. When it finally did. and we did pass it and presented it to the then incumbent President. Bill Clinton. he allowed it to fade into oblivion through a pocket veto. So we are back at it again. We passed another bankruptcy reform bill. Again. we had the farmers in mind in Chapter 12. because we made it permanent. It is a permanent solution to a vexing problem. and it is in bankruptcy reform. Now we have again at hand a conference report that treats our farmers in Chapter 12 the way they deserve to be treated. along with many other elements of our society who are protected and whose lives are enhanced by the other provisions in the bankruptcy reform measure. We await now the dissolution of that one little quarterinch problem that vexes us that keeps us from final passage of bankruptcy reform. In the meantime. we will continue with our vigilance for the farmers under Chapter 12 by passing this legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this Member rises today to express his support for H.R. 5472. which extends Chapter 12 bankruptcy for family farms and ranches to July 1. 2002. Chapter 12 bankruptcy once again is set to expire on January 1. 2002. This legislation is very important to the nations agriculture sector. This Member would express his appreciation to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin . the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. for introducing H.R. 5472. In addition. this Member would like to express his appreciation to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan for his efforts in getting this measure to the House Floor for consideration. This extension of Chapter 12 bankruptcy is supported by this Member as it allows family farmers to reorganize their debts as compared to liquidating their assets. The use of the Chapter 12 bankruptcy provision has been an important and necessary option for family farmers throughout the nation. It has allowed family farmers to reorganize their assets in a manner which balances the interests of creditors and the future success of the involved farmer. If Chapter 12 bankruptcy provisions are not extended for family farmers. it will be another very painful blow to an agricultural sector already reeling from low commodity prices. Not only will many family farmers have no viable option other than to end their operations. but it will also cause land values to likely plunge. Such a decrease in value of farmland will negatively affect the ability of family farmers to earn a living. In addition. the resulting decrease in farmland value will impact the manner in which banks conduct their agricultural lending activities. Furthermore. this Member has received many contacts from his constituents supporting the extension of Chapter 12 bankruptcy because of the situation now being faced by our nations farm familiesit is clear that the agricultural sector is hurting. Mr. Speaker. in closing. this Member urges his colleagues to support H.R. 5472.",

H.R. 4125 is a noncontroversial bill that will contribute to judicial efficiency and promote the sound management of the judicial branch. H.R. 4125 and its predecessor have been fully considered by the Committee on the Judiciary. On July 17. 2001. the Subcommittee on Courts. the Internet. and Intellectual Property of the Committee on the Judiciary held a legislative hearing on H.R. 2522. the precursor to H.R. 4125. Based on testimony received at the hearing and subsequent reaction. the subcommittee chairman. the gentleman from North Carolina . and the ranking member. the gentleman from California . introduced a clean bill. H.R. 4125. devoid of all controversial items. On May 2. the subcommittee conducted a markup of H.R. 4125.

H.R. 4125 contains a variety of noteworthy provisions. but I wish to highlight one in particular. Section 301 states that the Judicial Conference of the U.S. Courts should take certain steps to protect the privacy of judges and judicial employees. Namely. the Judicial Conference should ensure that the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts does not intercept electronic communications of judges and judicial employees without authorization from the Judicial Conference.

I wanted to add that one comment to the comments of the Senator from Nevada about the right man for the time. I would only say: Accolades to his ranking Republican on the committee as well. Senator SHELBY. who has been a dear personal friend of mine since we came to Congress together in 1978. I am confident in the leadership of our Intelligence Committee. I yield the floor.",

As we look at the Port of Jacksonville. there are major military facilities: Pensacola. the same. Port Canaveral. right adjacent to the Cape Canaveral Air Force Test Station as well as the Trident submarine turning base. As Senator GRAHAM has pointed out. we have a real risk. How do we go about determining what is in the container that might have started at Singapore. comes to the Port of Lisbon. is transferred around onto a different ship. and ultimately comes into one of our American ports? On the reverse we have had quite a bit of success. Indeed. through a machine called a gamma ray machine which was set up initially to try to stop the smuggling and stealingsmuggling of stolen automobilesthe gamma ray machine takes an xray picture of the container without the harmful side effects of radiation from xrays. You can see exactly what is in the container as the truck pulls up between two poles. The picture is there. The guard can check that against the manifest of what is supposed to be in the truck. Lo and behold. on the east coast of Florida there are some four or five gamma ray machines now set up. and it has virtually stopped all of the smuggling of stolen automobiles going out of those ports. If we can do that on the outbound cargo. clearly we have to figure out something for the inbound cargo because the vulnerability is there. I appreciate so much the leadership of my senior Senator from Florida. It is a privilege for me to join with him and Senator HOLLINGS to try to enhance this legislation as it comes to the floor.",

But they can only inspect a relatively small percentage of all the containers that come into that port. So they must depend upon intelligence information to allow them to identify which of those thousands of containers that are arriving every day at Rotterdam are the ones that are the most suspicious and. therefore. need to have this advanced technology applied. While part of the Sea Port Security Act is going to give. hopefully as quickly as possible. to all of our ports significantly better technology. we are still going to be relying on intelligence to focus on which of those containers to which that technology would need to be applied.

There exists now what is called an Alien Terrorist Removal Court which was set up to remove alien terrorists from our country. The problem is no one is using the court. The reason for that is we are required under the law to submit to the terrorists a summary of the intelligence we gathered on him and how we got it. Obviously. if the terrorist gets that information. then the people who provided that information are going to be killed or their lives will be at risk. My amendment provides that an independent Federal judge would take a look at the information and decide that it could not be shared but that the person should be deported. That is the first provision of my amendment. The second one provides that every 6 months we get a report back from Justice on how the terrorist court is working. how often the court is being used. and so forth. That is really all there is.

This is a comprehensive bill that moves forward the transportation needs of this Nation in a very positive way. connecting road. rail and air. They faced a great many challenges. I come from a State that has huge transportation infrastructure needs. For example. in the New Start program. they faced the challenge that the Federal Transit Administration account has been drawn down to dangerously low levels in the New Start program. and there are a number of programs that need funding. We were able to secure some funding for the New York City area. which has huge and substantial needs. In addition to that. as my colleague. the gentleman from New Jersey . pointed out. this bill moves forward in a very positive way. I think it is the first tangible way that any level of government began to look at the use of Stewart Airport as one of the four major airports in the New York metropolitan area. And this is not a Northeast regional issue or problem. it is a national problem. because 30 percent of all delays in air travel come out of that region. If we are able. through the commission of a study in this bill. to find a way to ease that problem. it will have an effect nationally. There are a number of other provisions in this bill that work to serve the Northeast and my constituents. an 187 corridor study and many other efforts in the high speed rail area. to connect our region.

Harris County. which includes Houston.

The goal of this technology is saving lives. through better distribution of emergency response personnel and a higher level of preparedness for incoming patients by emergency room personnel. The transmitted data will include the speed of the vehicle at impact. number of times that vehicle may have rolled. the number of occupants in the vehicle. heat generation. which may indicate whether or not the vehicle is on fire. and other valuable information.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the death last week of our friend and colleague NORM SISISKY claimed one of our great leaders. and took away one of my respected and personal friends in Congress. NORM symbolized the very best there is in public service. A good family man. NORM was widely respected for his honesty and integrity. He was also one of the most wonderful. witty and funny people I have known. On the Intelligence Committee. where I had the privilege to serve with NORM. you could always count on him to give everyone a hard time. Whether he was grilling the director of the FBI. or just kidding around with staff. NORM was relentless when it came to dispensing good humor and wellintentioned grief. But he always did so in the most embracing and engaging way. With a sparkle in his eye. NORM always had the unique ability to say the right thing to break the tension and put a human face on our work. But there was so much more to NORM SisiSKY than just his great sense of humor. When it comes to military and national defense matters. there was no one more knowledgeable or more committed than NORM. His expertise in military affairs enabled him to serve both his district and our nation well. As a member of the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee. NORM led the fight to improve our nations military readiness. enhance our national security. and ensure Americas leadership in the world. We owe a great debt of gratitude to NORM for his persistent and visionary leadership on defense matters. Clearly. our military and intelligence communities have lost a great friend. NORM came to Congress after a long and successful career in the private sector. He put his business skills and knowledge to work in many productive ways. especially helping lead the fight for a balanced budget and smaller government. NORM epitomized the kind of public servant our founding fathers had in mind when they wrote the Constitution: a skilled and successful businessman giving back to his community. and leading Congress with his thoughtful and pragmatic advice. We will miss NORMs knowledge. his leadership and his wonderful sense of humor. Our friend from Virginia made a huge impact in Congress. both as a leader and as a friend.",

I would like to take this opportunity to mention a recent action by a corporation based in my home State of Minnesota that will go a long way toward improving the quality of life of our residents. On March 20. 2001. the 3M Foundation gave the Nature Conservancy of Minnesota a gift of $3.2 million to preserve and restore two areas of grassland in the State. Appropriately. it was also the first day of spring. This is the largest gift ever given to the state chapter. The gift will be used to purchase prairie and forest land and to promote communitybased conservation efforts. This effort will have a significant and longlasting impact on Minnesotas wildlife and vegetation. 3Ms gift is one that will truly keep giving. offering current and future generations access to some of Minnesotas finest natural treasures. I commend 3M for its commitment to preserving Minnesota and it is my hope that the good work 3M does will serve as a national example to increase corporate giving and involvement in communities across the country.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I recently had the privilege to participate in an extraordinary event. the 15th National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic. This year it was held at Snowmass Village at Aspen. CO. Sponsored by the Disabled American Veterans. the Department of Veterans Affairs. and others. this event provides disabled veterans the chance to engage in various outdoor and indoor sports activities. More than 300 severely disabled veterans took to the ski slopes. tackled rock climbing. went scuba diving. or played sledge hockey. This wonderful program is much more than a source of fun and athletic challenges. it is designed to assist in the rehabilitation of veterans with severe disabilities. Physical activities are essential to improving physical fitness. refining motor skills. and building selfconfidence. Many of these men and women at one time thought that their disability ended hopes for an active. vibrant life. Instead of viewing their physical condition as a barrier to recreation. these individuals saw the opportunity to overcome the obstacle posed by their disability. The men and women at the clinic did not dwell on adversity. rather they eagerly engaged in the physical trial of sports. This event demonstrated the courage and abilities of these veterans. It also serves as an inspiration to others to be bold in redefining what the disabled can do. I had the privilege of being Chairman of the Veterans Health Subcommittee and I now serve as its Vice Chairman. I worked with the VA. the DAV. and other wonderful groups in strengthening the services provided to veterans and I look forward to continuing this cooperation. The Veterans are the only group of Americans that have earned their benefits. they didnt just happen to be here. they earned it on the battlefield. they earned it in service to America. Serving Americas veterans mean exploring new options for enhancing their quality of life. The Winter Sports Clinic exemplifies an innovative approach to honoring the men and women who served in uniform.",

It was 45 years ago that the Republic of Tunisia was formally established as an independent country. Over the years. Tunisia has forged a strong and solid relationship with the United States that spans beyond bilateral ties to cover issues related to world peace and economic partnership. The U.S. relationship with Tunisia has survived civil. regional and global conflict. During World War II. Tunisia supported the United States and allied forces as they landed in Northern Africa. During the cold war years. Tunisia established itself as a steadfast ally in the strategically important Mediterranean Sea. As we moved into the postcoldwar years. the Republic of Tunisia has remained a friend and ally of the U.S. and taken steps to develop closer military and economic ties with European allies and NATO. Today. the Republic of Tunisia continues to make important progress toward democracy by broadening political debate. advancing social programs. developing economic programs encouraging privatization of the banking and financial sectors. and improving the quality of life for its people. Tunisian citizens enjoy universal suffrage. and the nation is considered to be a leader among Muslim nations in safeguarding the rights of women and children. Further. Tunisia has acted as leader and catalyst for peacekeeping missions in suffering countries. contributing military contingents to operations in Cambodia. Somalia. the Western Sahara and Rwanda. Tunisia has also been a voice of moderation in the ArabIsraeli peace process and has called for greater international efforts to fight terrorism. Tunisia has been a model for developing countries. It has sustained remarkable economic growth. and undertaken reforms toward political pluralism. It has been a steadfast ally of the United States and has consistently fought for democratic goals and ideals. In commemoration of 45 years of independence for Tunisia. I urge my colleagues to reflect on our strong commitment to Tunisian people. our friends and partners in North Africa.",

Pennsylvania. which is being celebrated over several days culminating on Nov. 4 with a Divine Liturgy followed by a banquet and celebration. When the church was built. the Hanover Section of Nanticoke was still known as the village of Rhone. and immigrants from areas of Russia that are now part of Slovakia and Poland would walk many miles to WilkesBarre or to Newport Township to attend church after working long hours each week in the anthracite coal mines of the Nanticoke area. To unify these groups of CarpathoRussian settlers in a church closer to home. several families organized to build their own local church to serve their spiritual needs. These founders had family names such as Vancisin (Wanchisen). Cunder (Sunder). Bobak. Ducar. Motika. Pendle. Handoga. Sagan. Brenish. Chromoho. Hrinko. Mititka. Franchak. Sarochinsky. Gula. Franko and Huha. Construction began in the summer of 1911 and the church was dedicated on October 29 of that year with Father Kieko from Russia performing the first services. This year. several members of the church hierarchy will join the pastor. the Very Rev. Stephen Karaffa. and the parishioners in Nanticoke for the Divine Liturgy commemorating the dedication and sacrifices of those founding members. Among those on hand will be Metropolitan Theodosius. the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church in America and Archbishop Herman from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and Eastern Pennsylvania.

Susan Shiposki. a St. Johns parishioner. has designed and created two new icons for the church: \"The Mother of God\" and \"Christ the Teacher.\" Mrs. Shiposki is a noted iconographer who has created several works for the church. Her first icon was created four years ago in honor of her parents 50th wedding anniversary. Mr. Speaker.

Section 631 includes specific protection against the disclosure of personally identifiable information concerning a cable subscriber to law enforcement. by the cable operator. without the subscribers notification. However. changes in technology that have occurred over the last seventeen years require that section 631 be clarified.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased that the TreasuryPostal Appropriations Bill. H.R. 2590. includes funding to implement the Freedmens Bureau Records Preservation Act of 2000. The Freedmens Bureau Records Preservation Act was cosponsored by Representative JUANITA MILLENDERMcDONALD and Representative J.C. WATTS. I was privileged to manage the legislation on the floor of the House last year. This important Act requires the Archivist of the United States to preserve the records of the Bureau of Refugees. Freedmen. and Abandoned Lands. commonly known as the \"Freedmens Bureau.\" so that these records can be maintained for future generations. It further requires the Archivist to work with Howard University and other institutions to index the records so that they will be more easily accessible. The Freedmens Bureau. which was established in 1865. accumulated a treasure trove of records concerning newly emancipated AfricanAmericans. These records contain information on marriages. births. deaths. labor contracts. Government rations and backpay records. and indentured contracts for minors. The records are. in many instances. a key source of information to American families tracing their heritage. They are also a vital source of information for historians and students. The Freedmens Bureau Records Preservation Act has special relevance for Howard University. The fact that both the Freedmens Bureau and Howard University grew out of the same impulse to remediate the wrongs of slavery at the end of the Civil War linked the two institutions together at their birth. The fact that General Oliver Otis Howard served both as the Commissioner of the Freedmens Bureau and as the third president of the University that bears his name adds additional strength to the link. Therefore. Representative MILLENDERMcDONALD and I were honored to join many others in a ceremony at Howard University on February 27. 2001. to commemorate enactment of this important legislation. With the support of Congress. the National Archives will employ microfilming technology to preserve the invaluable Freedmens Bureau records. and Howard University will develop indexing strategies to provide their widest accessibility to scholars. genealogists. and the general public. Through this partnership. the Acts goals of ensuring preservation and promoting access can and will be achieved.",

I rise to introduce a resolution honoring the continuing service and commitment of the members of the National Guard and Reserve units activated in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In the days following September 11th. it was the National Guard and Reserve who were present on our streets and in our skies. They were present in our airports and on our waterways. They were deploying overseas in support of active duty units. This is not the first time we have seen these heroes in action. They are our associates and neighbors. our friends and relatives. And yet to many of us. their presence means so much more now than it did before. We must honor the modem day Minuteman. for as our citizensoldiers stand watch over us. they remind us that long before the phrase \"Homeland Security\" was crafted. they were here to preserve liberty on the home front. They were there to support our Army. Navy. Marines. Coast Guard and Air Force. And they are still there. supporting our nation in this time of danger. This war against terrorism may be lengthy and difficult. and we may at times feel less than fully secure. but I stand here today to tell you that I rest easier with the knowledge that the National Guard is on the job. We owe the men and women who have left their families and jobs to heed this call a great deal. and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting our National Guard and Reserve. Let us not allow a single Guard or Reserve member to join in this conflict. without knowing that the House of Representatives. and more importantly a grateful nation. holds them in the highest esteem. Let us pass this resolution now and give our heroes even greater strength to draw on in the difficult days ahead.",

Res. 45. the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. The President and his administration have been actively consulting with the Congress on the language of this resolution over the past days and weeks. Our committees have heard many testimonies from the administration and other experts. And. for many years now. we have been apprised of the threat of Saddam Hussein and his outlaw regime. It is time for the Congress to come together. to hold a public debate. and to vote on a critical request made by this Administration. This administration has worked closely. and will continue to work closely. with our allies and the United Nations. The challenge posed to the U.N. by President Bush in his historic speech before the General Assembly last month demonstrated the dedication that the U.S. wishes to keep the U.N. relevant. while plainly stating that our national interest cannot and will not be subjugated to Saddams willful deceptions and manipulations before that body. The world is looking to the United States to see our resolve. It is time for the world to see the American Congress debate whether we will support our Administration. I believe that we will show the world that this Congress. and the American people. overwhelmingly supports our President. It is not preordained the resolve we will show the world will lead to war. I believe that the resolve we show will demonstrate the U.S. will unite to confront the dangers that lie ahead.",

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in November 2000 in Shawano. WI. Two men tried to run an Asian couple off a road with a pickup truck. The men pulled up behind the victims car at a high speed and forced the couples car to swerve onto the shoulder. They then continued to chase the couple and buzzed close to the vehicle. The driver. Grant Heim. 19. used racial slurs when referring to the victims and was charged with a hate crime in connection to the incident. I believe that Governments first duty is to defend its citizens. to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law. we can change hearts and minds as well.",

Jim was an outstanding civilian employee of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA. Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. OMAO. the branch of NOAA that operates the agencys scientific ocean research vessels and the famous P3 \"Hurricane Hunter\" aircraft. Jim served as a program analyst in the Resource Management Division of OMAO. For 16 years. first with the Office of the Comptroller. then with OMAO. Jim used his talents as a program analyst to advance NOAAs mission and core values. Jim was credited with singlehandedly orchestrating and implementing OMAOs program to improve NOAA employee satisfaction. and with becoming a Diversity Coordinator not because he was asked to. but because he believed in the principles and in improving representation of diversity in the sciences. Jim began his commitment to diversity issues long ago. when he worked here in the U.S. Senate on Native American affairs as a legislative assistant for Senator Lee Metcalf of Montana. At NOAA. Jim also was instrumental in OMAOs adoption of a Washington. DC. elementary school and worked to get NOAA pilots and ship captains to talk to youth about our sea and skies. When the school needed computers. Jim quickly came up with 10 surplus ones for students. He was in the process of arranging a \"tour\" for the kids on a NOAA research vessel. Jims demonstrated commitment to inspire minority youth to become future scientists sets a standard for us all to follow. Jims colleagues say that he was always a gentleman. that he listened first. and talked second. With his subtle sense of humor. and ready willingness to help. Jim is already sorely missed by his colleagues throughout the NOAA community. Our deep condolences go out to Jims wife Billie and their 11year old son Ben in this very difficult time.e",

More than 500 individuals have played the pipes and drums of the Shannon Rovers Band. Currently. the band is made up of over 75 pipers. drummers and color guard members. and includes a student program with over 20 individuals actively learning the pipes and drums. The band was organized in 1926 by a group of Irish immigrants. and was originally named the Shannon Rovers Fife and Drum Corps. The group was directed by Dan Hennessy and played for every Irish gathering in Chicago during the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1932 the decision was made to switch from fife and drums to the \"Irish Warpipe\" or bagpipe. Thus. the Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band was introduced. In the 1930s the band performed for Presidential candidate Franklin Delano Roosevelt and has continued to play for Presidents and distinguished guests to this day. including Presidents Harry S. Truman. John F. Kennedy. Lyndon B. Johnson. Richard M. Nixon. and Pope John Paul II. The bands popularity has grown immensely over the years. The demand for them to play continues to grow in the Chicago land area. as well as across the Nation. and around the world. The Rovers continue to excite Chicagoans with performances at halftime of Bears games. leading the prerace ceremonies at Chicago Motor Speedway. performing at the Celtic Fest. and at the Irish Heritage Center. They make an annual trip to Springfield. IL. for the Illinois State Fair and they also perform at countless rallies and dinners. The members of this group freely volunteer their time for all types of civic and charitable events. Internationally. the band is a perennial contender in Irelands Fleadh Cheoil. a worldclass traditional Irish music event. The Rovers have placed first. second. and third in this prestigious competition. The Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band has accomplished much in the 75 years since its founding.

If enacted. this legislation would authorize the Forest Products Laboratory of the U.S. Forest Service to study the effectiveness of silverbased biocides as a wood preservative treatment. According to silver experts and academics. silver biocides could serve as a viable. safe and cost effective alternative wood preservative. Given silvers longstanding role as an effective biocide. testing should be undertaken to determine silvers suitability as a wood preservative. Thus. I feel it is important to study and fully explore the potential of silver as a wood preservative. Mining has been an important part of Idahos history since the late 1800s. It became Idahos first industry and remains a critical part of Idaho and the nations economy. Mining in Idaho has supplied the nation with minerals necessary for todays modern lifestyle which many of us take for granted. In 1985. the mines of Idahos Coeur dAlene mining district produced their one billionth ounce of silver. The Sunshine Mine was Americas richest silver mine. producing over 300 million ounces of silver. more than the entire output of Nevadas famous Comstock Lode. Silver contributes to our quality of life in many ways. and its use as a biocide in wood products is an important application that must be explored. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass legislation that would create a comprehensive research program to test the viability of silverbased biocides for the treatment of wood products.",

The bill makes very modest changes to update the legislation. including asking HUD to explore ways to increase tribal selfdetermination with regards to the NAHASDA block grant. It also asks HUD to do a study of black mold. which is apparently is a growing problem on reservations. In 1996. Congress passed NAHASDA in order to strengthen federal housing assistance for tribal communities. NAHASDA provides block grants to Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities. TDHEs. for affordable housing activities that were previously under general housing programs. including public housing. section 8. Youthbuild. and homeless programs. Consolidating these funds into a block grant helps to meet the goal of selfdetermination for Indian tribes. Since its passage. NAHASDA has achieved many successes. HUD reports that through NAHASDA. 25.000 new units of housing has been produced in Indian communities. In spite of NAHASDAs successes. many of the people in these communities still live in severely substandard housing. According to the NAIHC. Native American housing is said to be six to eight times more crowded than the national average. Furthermore. it is estimated that 1 out of every 5 Indian homes lacks complete plumbing. and 40 percent of homes on Indian lands are overcrowded. These figures demonstrate the need for affordable housing programs. like NAHASDA. that benefit Native American communities.",

Also. I wish to thank Senator SARBANES for his leadership in moving this bill quickly through the Banking Committee. Throughout my 16 years in Congress. I have been dismayed by the living conditions of Native Americans. On numerous occasions. it has been documented that Native Americans have the worst housing conditions in the United States. Rampant overcrowding. homelessness. and a crumbling housing stock plague our tribal communities. and South Dakota has seen some of the worst conditions overall. Our tribes suffer from anywhere between 50 to 80 percent unemployment on Native American reservations. According to the Housing Assistance Council. South Dakota contains 10 counties that are inhabited by 30 to 65 percent of persons below poverty. NAHASDA was originally passed in 1996 to strengthen Federal housing assistance to tribal communities. NAHASDA provides block grants to Indian tribes for affordable housing activities that were previously under general housing programs. including public housing. section 8.

NAHASDA has proven to be a vast improvement over the previous way that housing assistance was provided to tribes.

He also played a significant role in the political sphere. earning respect and admiration from legislators on both sides of the aisle.

In pursuit of this mission. he founded San Diegans Against Handgun Violence in 1988 and also became national vice chairman of Handgun Control. Incorporated. As a leader of San Diegans Against Handgun Violence. he fought for gun safety and tougher gun laws. He was a true national leader in this fight. I will miss Stan Foster.

    "speech": "Madam President. mental illnesses inflicted by tragedies like the assault on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are a serious problem. Every American family is at risk. whether a loved one worked at the World Trade Center or the Pentagon. or whether the family simply watched the attack on television from a continent away. Studies of other disasters teach us that the most vulnerable are those who are most directly affected. but even those less directly touched by these tragedies are vulnerable. The hearing on September 26 made it clear that Congress has an obligation to assure that these mental health needs are met and that we are better prepared for the mental health consequences of future tragedies. Our witnesses. as well as other experts in the field. identified four key needs: better advance planning and preparedness. training of mental health professionals to treat the specific mental health needs arising from disasters. resources to identify and treat those who will suffer longterm mental health problems as a result of the September 11 attack. research on how to improve our responses to the needs of disaster victims. The legislation passed through the Senate today by unanimous consent intended to meet all four of these needs. This help is essential for the individuals and families who were injured or lost a loved one. for the brave public safety officers who put their lives on the line trying to rescue or recover victims. and for the many other Americans of all ages in communities across the country who have suffered psychological trauma as the result of these attacks. The bill was developed in close collaboration with Senator WARNER. Senator FRIST. Senator CLINTON. Senator WELLSTONE. and Senator GREGG made important contributions and I thank them for their efforts. It is my hope that it will be approved by the House. and that it will be followed by an adequate allocation of funds to help all those who need it.",

Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact. rules are the way a civilized society governs its conduct. We teach our children to play by the rules. We teach them fairness. Mr. Jefferson saw the rules as a way of protecting the views of the minority against the abuses which the wantonness of power is too often apt to suggest to large and successful majorities. protecting the views of the minority for the good of the democracy against the wantonness of power which suggests itself to the majority. This may not be a sexy or glamourous topic for the American people. but it has to do with how your government functions. It has to do with the free exchange of ideas. Jefferson did not say the purpose of the rules is to allow the majority party to work its will without resistance. He said the purpose of the rules is to also protect the minority opinion against the wantonness of power of the majority. For too long. for too long this body has witnessed the wantonness of power manifested in the rules exercised by the majority. You may have the right to do that. but is it right to do that? Is it good for the country? Mr. Jefferson also asked the following: He asked if it makes sense for one generation to charge the next with a debt. because if it does charge the next generation with a debt larger than it can repay. than the Earth belongs to the dead. not the living. The rule question today was are we charging the next generation with a debt and thereby giving the Earth to the dead. not the living? Your rule is designed to stop that debate.",

In addition. her deep sense of obligation to the future of young people has led her to serve as National Honor Society advisor and on various committees.

Ginny deserves high praise for her devotion to teaching and her passion for ensuring every student left her classroom equipped with more than just the basic reading skills necessary for a productive life. Ginny has always recognized the importance of reading as the one educational skill upon which all other learning is based. Throughout her tenure. she continuously sought to improve the methodology and the mechanisms for teaching reading. She was instrumental in establishing and developing the school districts \"Right to Read Program.\" and its \"Secondary InService Reading Program.\" Ginny also was a driving force in curriculum development for the district. most notably her work on a committee that reviewed Language Arts texts and materials for elementary grades. Ginnys pioneering efforts and innovations were vital to implementing a suitable curriculum as the backbone of Oscodas excellent school system. So many of the hours and effort put forth by Ginny took place long after the work day had ended. It is difficult to fully grasp the commitment of time and energy made by dedicated teachers such as Ginny Sloan. but their families understand. Ginny would be the first to acknowledge that the accommodations made by her husband. Jim. and their family. played an important role in her success. Achieving success in the teaching profession often comes without much recognition or reward. In Ginnys case. she has earned an \"Excellence in Education\" certificate from the Oscoda Area Schools Board of Education and was recognized for 8th Grade achievements on the Michigan Educational Assessment Program test. However. those awards serve as only a small measure of her value as a school teacher. The true yardstick of her success is the gift of learning she bestowed upon her students. something that can never be taken away from them. Finally. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in honor of the YMCA of Greater New York in celebration of its rich and vital 150 year history. Throughout its history. the \"Y\". as many of us know it. has spanned three distinct historical periods. The first. from 18521902. is marked by a commitment to help newcomers to the city and the creation of programs of social change to help groups impacted by war. population shifts and industrial changes. The New York \"Association\" was staunchly abolitionist and formed a commission to minister to soldiers in camps and hospitals. and on the battlefields of the Civil War. After the War. new YMCA programs were started for African Americans. railroad workers and young boys from urban centers. From 19021952. the YMCA expanded its scope to all areas of public life and affairs. and women became members. Racial integration was attained nationally in the 1940s and much earlier in many New York City YMCA branches. The YMCAs expertise produced numerous vocational. skills training and job placement programs during these years. From 19522002. the YMCA focused aggressively on urban programs to help girls and boys. and their families. in the city. Programs were developed to deal with poverty. youth unemployment. delinquency and drug abuse. and many programs were put on wheels. such as Jobmobiles and Youthmobiles. in order to be located in the neighborhoods most in need. In New York City. during fiscal crises and national recessions. the YMCA maintained its firm commitment to the city through largescale childcare and expanded family programs. A growing emphasis on physical fitness led to many new program offerings. such as aquatics. cardiovascular fitness and sports leagues. including two sports invented at the YMCA in the late 19th centurybasketball and volleyball.",

In the voices of my children. who are 32 and 30 years old. this debate is really about yesterday. What this amendment represents is tomorrow. is the future. It is exactly why people are attracted to America. So what we are battling is yesterday with this amendment. The sham automobile efficiency provision in this bill is the proverbial drop in the oil bucket. They are talking 5 billion gallons of gasoline saved. We are talking 40 billion. How anyone can say this is about jobs and the American automobile industry. it is a joke. This is enough to say that the Edsel is making a comeback. The Congress can do better. The automobile industry is saying one thing. I understand that. We are not the automobile industry. we are the Congress of the United States. And when we vote this in. we are voting in less dependence on foreign oil. we are voting in high standards for our environment. we are saying you do not have to drill in ANWR. and we are saying that we have the technologies today to put into tomorrows automobiles. Support this amendment. It is a step toward the future. We will be better off as a result of it.",

It does nothing more than punish the automobile industry for making cars that people want to buy. I am opposed for many reasons. but let me focus on three. This amendment will force Americans to drive smaller cars that are less safe than what we drive now. Smaller cars mean more traffic fatalities: a fact confirmed by the recent NAS report. This amendment will also have the devastating economic impact of affecting every worker in the auto industry whose job will be affected. There are seven others affected as a spinoff from the one worker in the factory. This amendment will also impose these new standards on an impossible timetable. which the NAS report explicitly argued against. Why should Congress adopt policies that cause economic hardship. reduce consumer choice and lessen auto safety? Obviously we should not.

I am concerned that this amendment would put unrealistic standards. given the time tables. on this class of vehicles.

My concern is that the manufacturers who make these vehicles. these light trucks and pickups. that this amendment will threaten their ability to continue making them. In fact. DaimlerChrysler says that they could not raise the fuel economy standards of their Dakota or Dodge Ram pickup trucks 50 percent in 5 years. as this amendment requires. and it would therefore possibly stop them from producing them. I am not sure if it was the intent of the authors of this amendment to unduly hurt the farmers. ranchers. contractors. electricians. plumbers. carpenters. construction workers. and many others who use pickups and light pickup trucks as their office on wheels. By forcing heavy commercial pickup trucks that weigh less than 10.000 pounds to achieve car CAFE standards. this amendment sets a standard that no one. and.

But there is an even better reason to do this. Oil is the least abundant of all of our fossil fuels. All of it will be gone from this world before the end of this century if we and our fellow men continue to burn it at low efficiency. What then will we use for our industry. for the chemicals. clothing. construction materials. for every product used in our lives that is manufactured from polymers?

Many businesses in this area supply the auto industry. The estimate from General Motors is that we would lose with this amendment 65.000 jobs. DaimlerChrysler estimates a $35.000 job loss. a total of 130.000. Let me tell you at least partially why this job loss happens. The way we calculate these averages of milespergallon means that some auto imports. for example. have accumulated so many credits that they could actually continue to sell their lessmilespergallon trucks and displace our more gas efficient milespergallon vehicles that we are not going to be able to sell because of this amendment. This means fewer sales and less employment. Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to this amendment. Since the CAFE standards were implemented in 1978. the market for passenger vehicles has been severely distorted. As a result. today. lights trucks account for over have of the new car market. The American people do not want small underpowered. and unsafe vehicles to transport their family. But under CAFE. there are fewer change cars available as alternatives. The recent report from the National Research Council report found that. \"CAFE standards. probably resulted in an additional 1.300 to 2.600 traffic fatalities in 1993.\" Further. it noted that if the increase standards resulted in lighter or smaller vehicles. \"some additional traffic fatalities would be expected.\" An earlier analysis reported in USA Today estimated that for each mile per gallon CAFE saved. 7.700 people lost their lives. There is another price we will pay with this amendmentlost jobs. GM. Ford. and DaimlerChrysler say they would be forced to eliminate 135.000 jobs. In my home state of Michigan. more than a million workers could be affected by this amendment. Mr. Chairman. this amendment would limit consumer choice. reduce vehicle safety. and throw people out of work. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no.\"",

Furthermore. it takes away flexibility mechanisms that allow auto makers to respond to unexpected changes in consumer behavior. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the appropriate venue for CAFE review. NHTSA must consider the safety tradeoffs. utility impacts. and economic feasibility of any CAFE increase. The National Academy of Sciences outlines these tradeoffs in its report released this week. It warned of overly ambitious CAFE increases with short implementation periods. NAS stated that quick significant increases would have a detrimental effect on vehicle safety and the health of the auto industry. If we adopt the MarkeyBoehlert amendment. tens of thousands of jobs will be jeopardized as production plans are significantly disrupted. By comparison. the current bill takes the right approach by allowing NHTSA to determine the appropriate timetable and the appropriate fuel economy standard. The auto industry is the largest manufacturing industry in the United States. We must be judicious in our approach and mindful of unintended consequences. Vote no on the amendment.",

This amendment requires that the INS eliminate its enormous immigration application processing backlogs and requires that all backlogs be eliminated within one year. It also requires that the INS prevent any backlog efficiencies where problems are known to exist. The INS has been notorious in the past for being long overdue in issuing backlog reports for Congress to access. This has resulted in an INS backlog of 4.9 million immigration applications. Efforts in the past to reduce the backlog were unsuccessful. The Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2000 authorized appropriations to reduce backlogs but the appropriate expenditures were predicated on the INS submitting a backlog report to Congress. 4.9 million applications later. were still waiting. As it stands. H.R. 3231 doesnt go far enough. It would eliminate the wait for a backlog report before using funds to start reducing the backlogs but it would not place a requirement on the INS to eliminate the backlog right away. And thats what we need if we are serious about this problem. 4.9 million people and their futures and maybe those of their families are behind those unprocessed immigration applications. Many are hanging in \"status limbo\" waiting for a decision on which way to go or what to do next.

If you are trying to recruit and retain the best in Federal employees. why are you going to take away the right to independent review. the right of appeal. and make them basically employees at will? No one is going to leave a job in the private sector or move laterally from another agency if they are going to be subject to those restrictions. If we have a problem. let us look at the overall civil service system in that context instead of putting pieces into different agencies. It is going to become unmanageable in my judgment.

I agree with the chairman that this bill is an improvement. a considerable improvement in the characteristics of the INS. But it does not go far enough at all unless it addresses the question of whether managers can be fired. I. myself. was a manager for 20 years in business. And I served at will. You serve at will as a manager because your ineptness pays a dear price for many. many more people. At the present time. the people who allowed Mohammed Atta to come to this country wrongly. once. twice. three times have not been fired. The people who. in fact. failed to protect us have not been made accountable. They may have been moved. transferred or even promoted. That is not accountability. And when we talk about patronage. and I respect my colleagues defense of the status quo of jobs for life that often exist within the Federal service. I might remind them that the FBI does not enjoy that and the FBI is not a patronage organization. The CIA does not enjoy that. and no one would say it was patronage. The United States Army. the United States Navy. the United States Marine Corps. the Coast Guard does not enjoy the job protection that they presently have at the dysfunctional INS.

It is very easy for this body to come back and trim around the edges as quickly as they would like and define those people who should be granted the ability to make this mistake and not be held accountable and not be fired. That would be the right of this body and the right of the other body and the right of the President. I am here today saying that we must today end the possibility that the people who allowed this to happen because of their negligence or because of an absence of their willingness to look at the INS agents own notes that said that Atta had admitted that for 5 of the 6 months he was a visitor he was unlawfully getting flight training. and if they had called. they would have found out that he was only learning to fly. not to take off and land.

The Border Patrol has helped me. and they have not helped me because they have exemption from whistle blowing. They have helped me because they care a great deal about getting the kind of management reform they need so they can be proud of the jobs they do.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong opposition to the Issa amendment offered to H.R. 3231. the Immigration Reform and Accountability Act. The amendment would: (1) eviscerate existing civil service laws that protect against hiring on the basis of patronage and cronyism. and (2) eliminate all employment procedural protections in disciplinary proceedings. including those in collective bargaining agreements. Among other things. this would allow whistleblowers to be fired as a result of their actions. This amendment compromises basic federal employee rights. limits the ability of Congress to gain access to critical information about agency activities. and dramatically increase the already severe attrition rate within the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). By making it simple for managers to hire employees and summarily dismiss them outside of the civil service process. the INS would have the authority to circumvent the civil service system for hiring purposes. It would bring us back to a federal hiring system based on patronage and cronyism. which the civil service system was created to prevent. While the intent of this amendment may be to provide the agency the ability to seek outside professionals to provide expertise in specific areas not currently available within the agency. the consequence of this amendment could eliminate the Senior Executive Service Corps and exacerbate problems within the INS. The other provision of this amendment. eliminating restrictions on certain disciplinary and other adverse actions taken against employees. would do away with the due process protection and independent review and appeal that has served INS and its employees well for many years. Mr. Chairman. INS workers deserve basic rights and freedoms as federal employees such as the freedom to \"blow the whistle\" on practices that do not serve the best intersts of the INS and of our nation. Adopting the Issa amendment jeopardizes the basic employee rights and privileges guaranteed by the civil service system. and it further hampers the ability of the INS to attract and retain dedicated and loyal employees to do the work associated with one of our countrys most important responsibilities: immigration.

I know some of my colleagues have other things that they need to be at and so I want to first of all recognize the gentleman from Illinois . who has been really one of the stalwart fighters in the battle for oxygenated fuels. for biofuels. for making certain that wherever possible we grow the energy that we need here in the United States.

He has been afire on this issue in terms of biofuels. and we worked with the gentleman on not only this but ultimately moving forward with biodiesel. a product that can be made with a blend of diesel fuel and soybean oil or other oils. Soybeans seem to work the best. These are ways that we can help solve our energy problems by growing more of that energy supply. I want to just come back to one point that the gentleman made about MTBEs. Now. we know that MTBEs cause cancer. We also know that it leaches into the groundwater. The reason that ethanol is such a great product in terms of replacing it really is twofold. First of all. we know that ethanol is harmless to people. As a matter of fact. if one puts it in an oak barrel for 7 years. many people enjoy it in the form of bourbon. a modified version of whiskey. So it is something that actually can be consumed by human beings. and it is consumed by human beings. More importantly. it is actually cheaper than the MTBE. Let me just share some numbers that because ethanol contains twice as much oxygen as MTBE. one only needs to blend half as much. in other words. 5.7 percent ethanol by volume compared to 11 percent MTBE. If one weighs out the economics of it. this decision will allow California to replace 18 cents worth of MTBE with only 7 cents worth of ethanol. In other words. consumers in California will actually save 11 cents a gallon because of this decision. It is good for the environment. It is good for our energy independence. It is good for the farmer. but ultimately it is going to be good for the consumer as well. So I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois for his remarks. I appreciate him stopping by. I know he has a busy schedule. I also have another good friend and colleague from the State of Nebraska who has been working on this issue for a very long time as well. the gentleman from Nebraska .

It really is time that we have one. As the gentleman indicated. the gentleman from Nebraska . according to the numbers we have from the United States Department of Energy. the U.S. imported more than 8.9 million barrels of crude oil per day in the year 2000. That represents over 60 percent of our domestic crude oil demand. Now that is a scary number. but it gets worse. We are currently importing in excess of 613.000 barrels a day from Iraq. Now in case it has been forgotten. Iraq is the place where Saddam Hussein calls home. We are importing over 600.000 barrels a day every day from Saddam Hussein. At $25 a barrel. that is a lot of money. Supposedly that money is now being used for food and medical supplies. humanitarian concerns. but the truth of the matter. of course. is we cannot know exactly how Saddam Hussein spends that money. The California waiver decision decreases our dependence on foreign oil and increases demand for cleanburning. domesticallyproduced ethanol. It is a great decision and. again. in the words of the old spiritual. oh. happy day.

North Korea. one of the poorest nations in the world. that cannot even feed its own people. would wake up some morning and would have the vision that it wanted to commit mass suicide. and assuming it is several years in the future and they had somehow developed a nuclear missile with the capacity to even reach our coast with any sort of precision at all. it would be much more likely they would put a biological or chemical weapon on it. in which case they would use multiple warheads.

Ostensibly we are doing this to have some sort of strategic advantage over some rogue nation holding us hostage with the prospect that they might send off a weapon of mass destruction by missile. The fact of the matter is that there is speculation that we may not be able to come close to 100 percent effectiveness. Twenty or so years ago when they were talking about President Reagans Star Wars. one of the groups that was advocating against it used to come out with an umbrella with holes in it and say that is the kind of protection you are getting. It is essentially the same situation here. The probability that you would be able to get 100 percent of any weapon sent over in most estimations of any reasonable scientist is nonexisting. So you would have no confidence that it was 100 percent reliable. and I would suggest that leaves you with no ability to effect a strategic decision.

It is a little bit frustrating as we are trying to get more information from the administration to find out exactly what their vision is in regards to missile defense: Is it going to just be landbased or seabased. airbased? Is it going to involve a spacebased type of missile defense system? Is it going to be a limited defense system? Is it going to be a national missile defense system or a universal application which we will share with our allies or any country in the globe who wants it? Because what kind of moral position would we be taking if we do in fact develop the technical means to deploy a system such as this but not offer it to other nations around the globe when an intentional or an accidental launch of a nuclear weapon could result in tens of thousands or millions of casualties in a particular country? This is what we need to keep asking the administration about. I for one am not sure if it is the right moral position to just come out and oppose any type of system at all. There is a lot of discussion about a rogue madman launching a nuclear missile at the United States. but there is also the possibility of these missiles falling into the wrong hands. a possible terrorist gaining control of some launch capability in Russia. for instance. I think is a real possibility. or even an accidental launch and what kind of position would we be in then if we were not at least going forward on the research and development and exploring the feasibility of this type of system at some point in the future. But for me at least fundamentally there are three overriding questions that I am waiting to get answers for. Firstly. will it work? Do we have the technological capability of pulling it off? Secondly. how much is it going to cost the American taxpayers to deploy such a system? And. thirdly. even if we do find something that works and we can deploy it. is it going to make the United States more or less secure in the final analysis?",

This historic ruling has paved the way and established equal and just civil rights for Americas disabled citizens. 25 years ago. disabled Americans did not have access to many federal buildings. schools. public transportation. and voting booths. An undue burden was placed upon citizens with disabilities. and they were not treated with the respect. courtesy. and equal opportunity that all Americans should be afforded. Dr. James L. Cherry. a Georgian. led the fight to insure that disabledcitizen rights were acknowledged and protected. Dr. Cherrys suit against the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare brought about not only changes through the courts. it renewed and confirmed our Nations belief that equal opportunity is an unalienable right for all. I would like to thank Dr. Cherry for his courage. commitment. and foresight. As we observe the 25th anniversary of Cherry vs. Mathews. we are all reminded that our great nation was built upon a foundation of principles and equality and that has been sustained by the ideals of opportunity and justice.",

Philomena Mancini. for fifty years until she passed away. He gave his wife. his son. Robert. and his two granddaughters much to be proud of.

It was following the war that he began running his fatherinlaws printing business and editing a weekly newspaper. Then. in 1958. he was elected for the first of three times to the Colorado State House. He earned a distinguished reputation with those who knew and worked with him there. including former state Rep. Wayne Knox whom The Denver Post quotes as saying. \"He was a very wellrespected. reasonable. moderate legislator.\" and \"a nice guy. a very good guy.\" Elmer had the honor of chairing the House Finance Committee and served on the Joint Budget Committee as well as on the Legislative Council. His drive to serve others didnt stop there. however. In 1963. he began working as Manager of Revenue and Director of Budget and Management for the City of Denver. He also served on the Executive Board of the Colorado Municipal League and became president in 1970. Incredibly. he also found time to serve as a board member of the Regional Transportation District. and as a member of the Sons of Norway. In addition. his leadership stretched to serving for a term as the International President of the Municipal Finance Officers of the United States and Canada. Mr. Speaker. Elmer Johnson was a distinguished veteran. a devoted father and husband. and a selfless leader. Today. I would like to pay him tribute on behalf of Congress for his lifelong dedication and honest leadership to the people of the United States.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. over the past decade. the number of women in the Federal Prison system has grown by 182 percent. compared to 152 percent for men. Prison has never accommodated the needs of women prisoners well. And while health care available to lowincome women is poor. women in prison face terribly inadequate medical care. Although all women in federal prison receive annual OBGYN exams. the ban on federal funds for abortion services is a direct assault on womens reproductive health care. There are many reasons why women decide not to bear children. Abortion has been a legal health option for women for almost 30 years. But because women in federal prison are more likely to be poor and minority. the ban prevents these women from controlling their own bodies. Women who are able to pay for abortion may use their own funds to do so. however. jobs available to prisoners pay at a rate of 23 cents to $1.15 per hour. This means that inmates make anywhere from $4.80 to $16 per week. At this rate. very few inmates are able to make enough money to pay for an abortion. The ban on the use of federal funds effectively forecloses their opportunity to obtain these health services. Imprisonment is a necessary punishment when the law is broken. Imprisonment does not mean. however. that prisoners have no right to safety and medical care. Poor medical care is not punishment. its a denial of fundamental rights.

They are extremely skilled. they can hit both forehands and backhands with pinpoint accuracy. And their serves are clocked at well over 100 mph. Venus and Serena enter each match wellprepared and confident. but the sisters always handle themselves with grace. What is perhaps most telling about them. though. is their love for each other.

Why did the market drop hundreds of points after the President made his speech on Tuesday? It is because of a lack of confidence in the BushCheney team that it will demand accountability from its big contributors on Wall Street and its CEO friends. because of the coziness that the BushCheney team have with wealthy interest group after wealthy interest group. Let me give an example. Three weeks ago. President Bush and House Republicans trooped off to a big fundraiser where the prescription drug industry gave $2 million to the Republicans. The next day. on a partyline vote on amendment after amendment after amendment. the consumer side lost and the drug industry side won. The oil industry is writing energy legislation for the Republicans. the chemical industry is writing environmental legislation. Wall Street is writing Social Security privatization legislation. the insurance companies are writing Medicare privatization legislation. and the pharmaceutical companies are writing prescription drug legislation.

The Presidents plan creates tough new criminal penalties and enforcement provisions to punish those who refuse to play by the rules. This is America. and those who break the law and threaten the integrity of our financial markets must pay the piper and return their illgotten gains. Mr. Speaker. the House earlier this year took steps to codify the Presidents plan into law. even before his address on Wall Street. On March 7. the President first said that CEOs or other corporate executives should not profit from erroneous financial statements. He also said that corporate officers who clearly abuse their power should not serve in the leadership of public companies. The House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan accounting reform bill in April that included both of these initiatives. When the President called. the House responded. As we continue to install a new ethic of corporate responsibility. we must strike the right balance between empowering the SEC to do a better job and not overregulating or tying ourselves up in unnecessary red tape. At the end of the day. we must punish the crooks. not the honest brokers.",

Mr. Speaker. why are we so bent on storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain? Is it because the U.S. has already conducted more than 1.000 underground nuclear bombs in the deserts of Nevada? How fair is it to ask the good people of Nevada to also be the sole keeper of our Nations highly radioactive nuclear waste? How fair is it to transport nuclear waste across Americas farm lands. which are easier targets for terrorists to attack? The fact of the matter is the largest concentration of nuclear reactors lies east of the Mississippi. and the risk of transporting highly radioactive spent fuel from these nuclear plants is a risk this Nation just cannot afford to take. Mr. Speaker. highly radioactive spent fuel or nuclear waste is one of the most toxic and dangerous substances known to mankind. For 10.000 years. highly radioactive spent fuel is dangerous to human life. Visit the Marshall Islands if my colleagues want to see the residual effects of some 66 nuclear bombs that were exploded in Micronesia. The reason why we discontinued testing in the Marshalls is because we found strontium 90 in milk products in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Visit the islands of Moruroa and Fangataufa in the South Pacific and ask the French Government if after detonating 220 nuclear bombs. that nuclear contamination is now leaking into the ocean in the Pacific Ocean. despite assurances from the French Government officials that this process is okay and is good for 1.000 years. Give me a break. Mr. Speaker. I fear the good people of Nevada are going to experience the same thing. If the Congress approves this project. the Department of Energy suggests there will be as many 108.500 surface shipments of nuclear waste making its way across the heartland of America. Another 3.000 shipments will make their way by barge across our waters. Mr. Speaker. whether we spend $1 or $100 billion to clean up our Nations nuclear waste. any amount of money can never be equal to the life of any human being.",

They have done so honorably. steadfastly. and to be Texas plain with them. they have done so doggedly and working and speaking for the care of their constituents will. For that. I admire and respect them. To paraphrase Reverend Billy Graham. I hate sin but I love the sinner. I hate the absence of a permanent repository. but I love and respect those who oppose this bill. I simply differ with them. and I differ with them for these reasons: I think. first. that it has an unparalleled safety record in transporting nuclear fuel. That is necessary. That is first: and. second. the long open public licensing process. More than 45 years of experience and 3.000 successful shipments of used nuclear fuel within the United States demonstrates that this material can be safely transported to Yucca Mountain by rail and/or by truck. No radiation release. no fatalities. no injuries or environmental damage has occurred because of the radioactivity of the cargo. The containers used to ship nuclear fuel are specially designed. robust steel containers that have undergone rigorous testing and can withstand extreme conditions including longlasting fires. highspeed crashes. even submersion in water. The maintained integrity of the containers ensures the health and safety of the public and environment during transportation of spent nuclear fuel. Mr. Speaker. upon site approval. a three step nuclear regulatory commission licensing process will test and verify DOEs scientific work in a highly rigorous public process. The scientific work will continue throughout the licensing period and operation of the repository so that the government will always be governed by the most recent science. Again. I admire and respect those who defend their constituents. I urge my colleagues. however though. to support H.J. Res. 87. Let us move this bill on and get it behind us.",

Transporting tons of waste to Yucca Mountain will not eliminate the piles of waste sitting at reactor sites across the country. It will barely make a dent in them for years to come.

I would remind everyone that in the shuttered Zion nuclear power plant just 100 yards from Lake Michigan lies a thousand tons of highly radioactive nuclear waste stored next to Lake Michigan. This is not unique to my district. The Great Lakes have another 31 coastline sites where nuclear waste is stored. Twenty percent of the worlds fresh water is found in the Great Lakes. Thirty million Americans depend on the Great Lakes for fresh water. Not one scientist or scientific study claims that storing nuclear waste next to the worlds largest supply of fresh water is environmentally sound. Moving nuclear waste from 131 temporary storage sites around the Nation to one secure location where America has already tested dozens of nuclear weapons is the goal of the Nuclear Fuel Safety Caucus. We must move nuclear waste from the Great Lakes. Why Yucca Mountain? Because without Yucca Mountain. we would have to construct 131 permanent storage facilities for nuclear waste in 39 different States. These storage facilities are close to groundwater. earthquake zones and in close proximity to major cities. including San Francisco. Boston. New York and Chicago. Without Yucca Mountain. 161 million Americans would have to live their entire lives within 75 miles of a nuclear waste site. And then there is the cost. According to the governments own study. the cost of building 131 permanent storage sites would be over $61 billion. To cover this. the Federal Government would have to borrow from Social Security or raise taxes. Perhaps we could reinstitute the death tax. but we would have to double it to pay for the cost. And that would not cover the lawsuits which would total over $56 billion for reneging on the promise to provide a nuclear waste storage site. A vote for this resolution is a vote to protect our Nation from further terrorist attacks. Removing nuclear waste from 131 sites to a single repository buried deep inside a mountain range 100 miles from a population center is much safer from sabotage or terrorism. I urge the adoption of this resolution. Let us wipe clean the terrorist shooting gallery of 131 sites located around the country and vote for this resolution for a secure environmental future.",

In the southeastern United States in the Tennessee Valley region. we are heavily dependent on coalfired plants. I share the environmentalists goal of trying to reduce the emissions of these fossilfired plants. We also have in the Tennessee Valley Authority region five nuclear reactors online.

The UK squad has now won UCAs National Championship an unprecedented twelve times. in 1985. 1987. 1988. 1992. and 19952002. more than any other Division 1A school. In fact they are the only squad to ever win back to back championships twice and also the only team to win three. four. five. six. seven. and now eight titles in a row. They are widely recognized as the best of the best in the Cheerleading community and have been a key contributor to the Universitys athletic success. The Wildcat basketball team is arguably the most storied program in the Nation and much of their success can be attributed to the enthusiasm and spirit generated by the Cheerleading squad. For those who have never had the opportunity of seeing a game in Rupp Arena. I can tell you that the atmosphere is absolutely electric. Besides the attention they receive on the court from the UK students and fans. the Cheerleading squad has also been covered by the national media. The squad has been featured on such programs as. \"Evening News.\" Connie Chungs \"Eye to Eye.\" and the \"CBS Morning Show.\" as well as in \"Southern Living.\" \"Gentlemens Quarterly.\" \"ESPN the Magazine.\" and \"Seventeen\" magazines. This recognition does not come without a price however. These young men and women sacrifice a considerable amount of their time and energy practicing. learning. and mastering their extremely difficult routines. This often means long practices and endless hours in the weight room. These young men and women are athletes in every sense of the word. I applaud the University of Kentucky Cheerleading squad for their commitment and dedication to their goals and dreams. They represent the University and the Commonwealth of Kentucky in a classy and professional manner. I am proud of each and every one of them.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I join with my colleagues on the Finance Committee. Senators GRAHAM and HATCH. to introduce legislation to clarify the rules governing the lowincome housing tax credit. This tax credit has played a critical role in the construction and renovation of housing for lowincome Americans. The Internal Revenue Service has issued five technical advice memoranda. TAMs. affecting the definition of eligible basis as defined in section 42(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. These TAMs had the effect of reducing the amount of tax credits available with respect to projects financed with lowincome housing tax credits. The bill we introduce today recognizes that certain expenses are legitimate development costs that are properly includible in the basis eligible for the tax credits. Among these development costs are: state and local impact fees. site preparation costs. reasonable development fees. professional fees. and construction financing costs. excluding land acquisition costs. The TAMs drew unworkable distinctions among various costs developers incur when they build lowincome housing. For example. under the law as interpreted by the IRS. a lowincome housing developer would have to distinguish between those trees and shrubs planted near a housing unit and those planted elsewhere on the property. The costs of trees and shrub near the housing unit could be included in basis. the costs of other landscaping could not. Rules like this are not only illogical. they also impose unnecessary burdens both on developers of affordable housing projects. but also on the IRS itself. whose employees must draw these highly technical distinctions when they audit the project. Our bill includes fair and rational rules. introducing the concept of \"development cost basis\" in lieu of \"adjusted basis\" to determine which costs may qualify for tax credits. It assures that reasonable and legitimate expenses which incurred only for the purpose of building lowincome housing will be eligible for tax credit. By Mr. INHOFE:",

You will hear quickly that this is because of the war. That is not true. The deficit that is forcing us to break into the Social Security trust fund. 43 percent of it is due to tax cuts. tax cuts for the very wealthy. tax cuts for corporations like Enron who stand to gain $254 million in tax breaks. I think that is wrong. When we had a surplus a year ago and when we did not have a war. tax cuts made sense. But now today. facing a war. facing a deficit. we cannot afford these tax cuts.

I agree with the gentleman that should be the way it is today. But. unfortunately. our society has blurred this issue and some have made it. one. an issue of the parents interest. or in this case. lack of interest in a newborn. Babies now born at 23 weeks generally survive. Some born even earlier have survived. Some critics of the legislation argue it is not necessary because what was alleged by one of our witnesses and several others that we have spoken with does not happen. It currently does happen. It clearly does happen. We would not be dealing with this issue if it did not happen. Ms. Stanek was just one of the individuals we spoke with through the committee. She brought with her other people who had also witnessed this type of action in a hospital. no less. a place where people go to receive care. Unfortunately. babies involved in inducedlabor abortions were left to die. even though those children were born alive. It is every instance that will be covered. however. A child born alive. whether the labor is induced or not. should be treated as a child. It seems like it should not be necessary for us to make this law. However. it was stated earlier today that viable. healthy infants are being permitted to die according to those of us who support this legislation. If we remove those adjectives. viable and healthy. that seems to except that infants who maybe are not healthy are being left to die. Is it okay for us to allow. unhealthy or maybe even unviable infants to be left to die on a cold shelf abandoned in some kind of cart in a hospital? It is not. This society must stand up for those who are the weakest. It is our responsibility as Members of the House to do so.

In fact. in the past 5 weeks or so. there have been more than 120 separate terrorist attacks committed by the FARC. including numerous bombings. the kidnapping of a presidential candidate. and a foiled attempt to destroy the city of Bogotas principal water reservoir.

No one has done more to hold the door open to a negotiated. political solution to end the violence in Colombia than President Pastrana. His perseverance and forbearance have made one thing clear: it is the FARCs willful disregard for the rule of law and human rights that led President Pastrana to make the decision to end the safe haven and send in Colombias security forces to reestablish legitimate government authority. Colombia today is a nation under siege by three terrorist organizations. Two of these terrorist organizations. the FARC and the ELN. have kidnapped over 50 Americans and murdered at least 10 Americans. The third. the United SelfDefense Forces of Colombia. is a vicious. violent terrorist organization that indiscriminately murders Colombians. Individuals who aid those terrorists dishonor and discredit themselves and the institutions that they represent. All three of these terrorist groups have been designated by the Secretary of State as foreign terrorist organizations because it has been determined that they are a threat to our Nations security.

We were fortunate enough to have dinner one evening with President Pastrana at his version of Camp David. which is in Cartagena. During that evening. we were able to get well acquainted. He described his being kidnapped by guerillas a few years ago and all that he went through and the general lay of the land down there and his struggles with the FARC and the ELN and the AUC. In the progress of that evening. what we learned is that there are roughly 600.000 acres of coca plants under cultivation in the country of Colombia. This allows them to provide roughly 90 percent of the cocaine that comes into the United States. As a result. FARC and these other vigilante groups are very well funded. I would imagine that their funding may exceed that of other legitimate enterprises within the country of Colombia. And so the people in Colombia have paid a great price. Last year. we were told that 29.000 civilians lost their lives in this conflict. They are caught in between the various groups. In many cases. they have no place to go and no place to hide. As has been mentioned earlier. seven members of Congress have been killed in the last 4 years. and five lawmakers are currently hostages in that country. So the present negotiations. or the negotiations that have gone on for the last 3 or 4 years. have broken down and now Colombia is basically under a reign of terror. where some of the things that we have seen around the world are now being perpetrated on the Colombian people. We have seen bridges blown up. water supplies such as in Bogota have been damaged and threatened. So it appears at this time that the only solution is that the United States provide help. We already have provided quite a bit. But the big issue is helicopters. because the pilots that are doing the spraying of the coca to try to eliminate it are certainly under a great deal of duress. So we need also some commitment from Colombia. but they need our aid.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I would like to note the Colombian Army has made progress in this area. and. while not perfect. no one is. At least they are trying and have made good progress. I also note that an alternative to a welltrained and respectful Colombian Army is the AUC. and that rightwing paramilitary respects no ones rights. engages in terrorism. illicit drugs. and kills innocent civilians. No one here is proposing that we repeal the Leahy amendment that prohibits aid to the units of Colombian military that engage in human rights abuses. Leahy is existing law. The Leahy restriction will remain law and has my strong support. and human rights concerns will not be thrown out the window in a new Colombian policy. I also note the counterdrug aid that we provided to the Colombian police. their antinarcotics unit. has been delivered and used in the last 2 years without even one allegation of a human rights abuse. I repeat. not even one allegation. The Colombians can and will respect human rights if we help them and we train them and we stand shoulder to shoulder next to them in the fight. The police antinarcotics unit is a case of study for engagement. Absent a new U.S. policy. the rightwing paramilitaries will fill the void in Colombia. and the human rights of no one. especially civilians. will be safe. We can stay on the sidelines or help our neighbor. The answer is clear. especially since September 11. We need to fight global terrorism whenever and wherever it raises its ugly head.",

It concerns me that the purpose of this resolution is for the Congress to give this administration the green light to become more heavily involved in the civil war in Colombia. I have the utmost respect for President Pastrana. but at the same time I am not in favor of expanding our involvement in Colombia by using our response to the terrorism threat after September 11 as a justification to participate in Colombias civil war. The FARC might be on the terrorist list. but the reasons that have been given for our involvement in Colombia have been counternarcotics and not counterterrorism. I do not want to erase this important distinction. Mr. Speaker. I read the Spanish press. and let me assure you that in Latin America and in my congressional district the support does not exist for having the United States exert its military power in Colombia. There are atrocities committed on all sides of this conflict. Today. Secretary Powell testified before the Commerce. Justice. State and Judiciary Subcommittee. on which I am the ranking member. and I told him that I understand that drug trafficking is a problem in Colombia. but that has never before been a reason to send American troops.

I would like to see the final package of managers amendments before it is agreed to. This amendment is a pretty straightforward amendment. It requires authorization of appropriations for the leasing of any transport/VIP aircraft. It would ensure that the Senate Armed Services Committee maintained its relevance by requiring Senate Armed Services Committee approval and authorization of any tanker lease. The amendment basically would instruct the Secretary of the Air Force that he could not enter into a lease for transport/VIP aircraft for any period that includes any part of fiscal year 2003 until he submits a report and there is a law enacted that authorizes the funds necessary to enter into the lease. This is a very expensive acquisition on the part of the United States Air Force. I believe it should be authorized before this transaction is entered into. It is basically a matter of whether the Senate Armed Services Committee will maintain its relevance over the acquisition of very expensive pieces of equipment. It would be appropriate for the Armed Services Committee to approve of it. That is the way we have traditionally done business around here. particularly on issues of major consequencesalthough it has fallen into neglect in years past.

It was a decided policy of the Congress based on our advice. The capital costs of acquiring such equipment now would be such that it would move out of the budget other items that have to be acquired in the moneys needed for homeland defense. So we authorized the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Air Force to enter into agreements not to exceed 10 years for these aircraft. They are readily available for lease. We limit the time they may lease them. But it is a very successful practice in the business world and I think would be a successful practice for the Department of Defense to lease this equipment when necessary and not to have standing around equipment that is not needed. We believe a leasing policy is the best policy for this type of aircraft. There are a series of competing aircraft available. but it is up to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Air Force to decide which ones they want. My advice to my friend from Hawaii. and I think he will join me. is that we oppose this legislation.

Ben Yehuda Street in Jerusalem is not Hebron. Dizengoff Square in Tel Aviv is not the Gaza Strip. Warnings from the State Department which lump trouble in the West Bank and Gaza Strip into blanket warnings for the entire State of Israel miss the larger picture. For the majority of Israelis who live inside the 1948 borders of Israel what is known as the Greenline. they live their life every day without disruption. For visitors to Jerusalem the eternal Capital. to vibrant Tel Aviv and to the Holy Galilee. by exercising common sense. they will have a wonderful. fulfilling visit. At a time when the U.S. people should be standing with Israel. we do not need alarmist bureaucrats dissuading Amertcans from visiting the Holy Land.

Mr. Chairman. the State Department has said in a rather comprehensive fashion that it is unsafe to travel to Israel. It is unsafe to visit there. It is unsafe for our personnel that are stationed there. This has had a broad and draconian effect on the economy of the State of Israel. Make no mistake. Israel is under almost constant state of siege from terrorists. The terrorists are the Palestinians. They take sniper attacks at small children. They blow up buses. Simply put. they are in a state of war. and terrorism is their tool. However. as we have often said in this Chamber. the way that you fight terrorism is to be wary. is to be vigilant. but you do not capitulate. Mr. Chairman. my amendment says to the State Department. let us have a sophisticated way for travelers to know where it is safe and where it is not. but we will not capitulate to terrorists by saying to school groups you should not visit there. saying to businessmen. if you travel there. your travel insurance will not be valid. to simply deal with the true effects of the status that Israel has. Mr. Chairman. I would say to my colleagues that Israel is not a victim and that they are not cowering to the terrorism. It is a thriving country. It is the birthplace of the major religions of the world. It is a place that is joyous and historic to visit. This amendment asks the State Department to return to the drawing board and give us a comprehensive but fair assessment of where it is safe to travel in Israel and where it might not be. While we consider this. let us remember that this state of terrorism that exists in Israel should also be addressed by the State Department of why it is the Palestinians do not appear on the terrorism watch list and why it is we continue to believe that terrorism is a state of being rather than something perpetuated on the people of the State of Israel.

Now. if we cannot take direct aim at Syria itself and. let us face it. Syria is very much a controlling influence in Lebanon. then why should we take aim at the innocent Lebanese government? This amendment attempts to send a message to Syria. It is clear and simple what its intent is concerning the crossborder attacks against Israel. which I condemn as well. But this amendment would not accomplish the intent of securing that border. All it accomplishes is to do more harm to the Lebanese. Lebanon cannot comply with this amendment that it deploy all of its troops to the southern border between Israel and Lebanon. because Syria will not allow it. I believe that the sponsor of the amendment is fully aware of that. The administration is against this amendment. Secretary Powell has sent a very strong letter stating what a destabilizing situation would occur in the south if U.S. assistance and its training. both military and economic. were to be cut off. USAID helps send Lebanese children to school through scholarship programs. That is the economic part of it. The IMET training helps train the Lebanese Army so that they can go down into the south and secure the border when given the political goahead to do it. I think Secretary Powell and this administration knows well that this amendment would seriously impede the longterm massive effort that has gone into pursuing critical U.S. policy in this area. That is what we should be most concerned with here. U.S. best interests in this region. This amendment does not further the United States best interests.",

Israel unilaterally withdrew its armed forces from the security zone on the LebaneseIsraeli border. The hope for a reciprocal response from Beirut never occurred. In conjunction with the Israeli withdrawal. the Lebanese Army was responsible for filling the vacuum left by the Israeli troops. In a location where law and order was meant to prevail under the watchful eye of the Lebanese Army. now exists chaos. disorder and lawlessness. The northern border zone is now occupied by Hezbollah troops. who filled the void when the Lebanese refused to take the action required by U.N. Security Council Resolution 425. Two weeks ago. I stood alongside families of three Israeli soldiers abducted by Hezbollah along the LebaneseIsraeli border. It is the Lebanese inaction that allowed that to take place. The State of Israel will continue to be at risk until Lebanon fulfills its obligation to the international community.

We should not be punishing Lebanon for the sins of Syria and the Hezbollah. I also think that threatening to eliminate our foreign assistance program for Lebanon is the wrong way to go about this. All of the $35 million that we allocate to Lebanon in fiscal year 2001 is provided to nonegovernmental organizations. private. voluntary organizations. contractors. They implement our assistance program for Lebanon. Not a penny of it goes to the government. and $3 million to the American University of Beirut and the LebaneseAmerican University to help with education. The largest program is the Rural Development Clusters program. which helps rural villages in Lebanon. It has been focused on the south in an effort to provide an alternative to the economic and social development activities of the Hezbollah.

We have heard today the results of months of work by the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House and the Senate Education Committee. and following that. by the conference committee. and I honor those Members who have struggled so diligently to reach this goal. As a Member of the California Assembly. I worked to establish similar accountability measures for California schools. programs which began 2 years ago. I applaud the committees for bringing this reform to all of the States. It will not be easy. nor will it be troublefree. However. requiring testing and accountability reporting which tracks the progress of distinct groups of children also encompasses the need for local schools and states to identify curriculum goals and academic standards. This is a good foundation for improving the focus of teaching. And. most important. as stated earlier by my colleagues. the critical aspect of our testing should be diagnostic. I am pleased that this is clearly stated in our rationale and implementation support. Important parts of this program are those that will enable teachers to improve their teaching skills. High quality teachers are the most critical predictor of student achievement. I am particularly pleased that the bill will continue to support programs like the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Credential Program that provide the opportunity for teachers to demonstrate high standards of their actual teaching accomplishment over a year of classroom performance. Like many of my colleagues and a majority of the Senate conferees. I am disappointed that as we are mandating programs to local school districts and have expressed our intent to fund them adequately. while we have done that. we have failed to phase in funding to meet the commitment Congress made 26 years ago to fund special education. It is particularly ironic that as we have rightly focused H.R. 1 on the needs of the poorest children through Title I. we have failed to recognize that twothirds of all children with disabilities are also eligible for Title I funds. We must work forcibly next year to meet this promise. There is much hope in H.R. 1. and I am happy to support this new focus on the importance of teaching all of our children.",

This is a significant accomplishment of this Congress and a great achievement for President Bush. who made education the top priority of his domestic agenda. The conference report largely reflects his priorities and his active support and involvement in this process. which has been crucial in bringing us to this point. There are many features of this bill that represent significant departures in Federal education policy. In this bill. we have given States and school districts more flexibility to use Federal funds as they see fit. We have included. as one of the many new options for children trapped in failing schools. an opportunity to use title I money to purchase supplemental services such as tutoring. which is a reform that many in this House have advocated for years. We have also consolidated many of the current duplicative education programs to better focus money to the students who need help the most. while continuing proven initiatives such as the Troops to Teachers program which has put several thousand highquality teachers in our highneed schools since To be sure. I have some misgivings about the new accountability provisions in this conference report. Many States such as Wisconsin have spent years developing successful accountability systems that do not necessarily involve testing all students on an annual basis. For the Federal Government to now demand that annual testing in reading and math take place every year in grades 3 through 8 amounts to a new mandate placed on the States. On the other hand. given that the national government has poured upwards of some $130 billion in the elementary and secondary education over the last 36 years with no discernible improvement in educational outcomes for our most disadvantaged students. I fully understand the urgent need to find some ways to make sure that new Federal resources are tied to results. In any case. I am pleased that this conference report makes a credible attempt to address my concerns about saddling States with this new responsibility.

I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. and I would like to thank both the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) for the bill we have before us today. I rise in support of H.R. 1. a bill that truly takes a step forward in helping our children get an education in the United States. Under this bill. our Nations schools will now take steps to narrow the achievement gap between high- and lowincome students. For example. in Santa Ana Unified or Anaheim High School District or the Anaheim Elementary School District. these are all some of the poorest school districts in our Nation and certainly some of the most overcrowded in our Nation. Over 50 percent of the students who are taught in these districts go to school in portable classrooms. H.R. 1 will help our Nation take a significant step forward in helping students like those in these school districts that I have the pleasure of representing. This bill increases funding for title I programs. increases funding for bilingual education and authorizes funding for school construction and modernization. It also includes funding for pedestrian and bicycle safety. a great issue of importance in my district. Although Congress still needs to do more to assist schools that teach children with special needs. H.R. 1 is a critical step in ensuring that no child is left behind.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I compliment the Senator from Arkansas for her excellent statement about health care. As the Senator pointed out the need for a prescription drug benefit to modernize Medicare. it reminded me of an unbelievable story. I dont know that it is fact. but it sounded pretty solid. The White House is floating a plan that someone on home health care would have to have a copay through Medicare in order to get that service. Certainly in our part of the country. home health care is an alternative to the more expensive care of a nursing home. and clearly it is a lot more expensive being in a hospital. And home health care. despite the expense. is clearly a lot better quality of life for the senior citizen than being in a nursing home or in a hospital if they can be medically treated appropriately and successfully in home health care. The Senator talked so eloquently about medical care in the State of Arkansas. Would it not be devastating to senior citizens to have a copay on home health care that they now do not have under Medicare?",

I ask the Senator from South Carolina. isnt it the case that the chart that the Senator shows on durum wheat starts showing a collapseactually. if the chart started back a bit. it would start showing a collapse almost immediately following the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. That was a Free Trade Agreement where Clayton Yeutter. who was then our trade ambassadorhe had a great disposition. He smiled all the time. And you always felt like the Sun was shining and everything was right. nothing was wrong. So Clayton Yeutter went up to negotiate with Canada on our behalf. and he came back with the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. We didnt learn it until later. but he had just traded away the interests of American farmers because what happened to us was an avalanche of unfairly subsidized grain that came into our country from the Canadian Wheat Board. which is a state monopoly. It would be illegal in this country. But in Canada they shoved all this grain into our country. And then when we went up to try to find out what the prices were so that we could take action against Canada. the Canadian Wheat Board said: Go fly a kite. We dont intend to show you any information. We have done that for years. The result is that our farmers have been devastated by this unfair trade. This all comes from Clayton Yeutters negotiations with the Canadians. is that not the case?",

    "speech": "There are so many issues we could talk aboutbeef to Japan. automobiles from Korea. Let me talk about this issue of wheat from Canada for a moment. It is a fascinating issue. There was a woman from North Dakota who married a Canadian and moved up to Canada. She came back for Thanksgiving or Christmas to North Dakota. And when she was back on the farm. her father said: Take up a couple bags of wheat. She was going to mill that back up in Canada and make bread because we have great spring wheat for making great hard bread. She took back a grocery sack full of wheat. All the way back to the Canadian border she met 18wheel trucks full of Canadian wheat coming southhundreds and hundreds of trucks. millions of bushels. every day. every hour. But when she got to the border with two grocery bags full of grain she was going to grind in order to make bread. they told her: You cant take two grocery sacks full of American wheat into Canada. She had to pour it on the ground at the border. despite the fact that all the way up she met Canadian 18wheel trucks hauling Canadian wheat south. She couldnt get two grocery bags full through the border near Canada. How did we end up with that? A circumstance where they are hauling all that grain. coming south from Canada in an unfair way. but you cant get two grocery bags full into Canada because of a trade agreement negotiated by people who were basically incompetent and traded away the interests of American farmers. Yet here we are being told: Lets not fix the trade agreements we have problems with. Lets give the President the authority to do new trade agreements. My message is very simple: Fix a few of the problems. just a few. start fixing a few. Demonstrate that there is some backbone in this country to stand up. to have the nerve and the will to fix some trade problems. Then come to us and talk about the next negotiation. But only then and not until then. Fix a few problems first.",

You are not bringing fresh peaches in here. they told me. You are not bringing your poultry in here. Rules are rules. This isnt aid. This is trade. Everybody looks out for the agricultural strength of their nations. That is what we are elected to office to do. But Heaven above. you would think I was a Communist or something in here trying to stop fast track. Fast track is a dirty. no good political gimmick. Everybody knows that.

In Idaho. as I am sure in many States. when a water right is transferred the State authority evaluates it and takes into account a number of considerations before they authorize the transfer.

Most of the western States have several problems including over appropriation. which means more people own the water than there is water. That is why we have been fighting back and forth. One of the things common to the West but not common to the East is called water compacts. We have them between counties sharing scarce water. we have them between States. Colorado happens to be an upper basin State. as it is called. California. a lower basin State. and we share the water that goes down the Colorado River. We also share the water. under a contractual agreement. that goes down the Rio Grande that starts in Colorado. that goes to Texas. In addition to interstate compacts. we have international compacts because we have a compact with Mexico to provide a certain amount of water from both of those rivers to that nation. Most of the water that is in ranching now recharges back to the ground. It goes back either through runoff irrigation. which goes back to the river. or if it is sprinkled. it usually recharges the aquifer to some degree. One of the big unknown questions for me is if there is a possibility. if we change the use or allow the Federal Government to change the use. it would in any way upset existing compacts. I would like to ask the Senator if he has thought about that. if he has any views on that.",

This is a vast improvement without question over what I believe is a major intrusion into water law and the very reclamation laws that many of our colleagues before us have written. I am not quite sure we have bridged the gap yet. I do believe there is a very real precedent here that is risky at best as it relates to our reclamation laws. This particular amendment has not withstood that test. Nor has it had the very intricacy of water law reviewed against it. That is critical. I know the intent and the good intentions of the Senator from Nevada. This is a phenomenally complicated area. To study water law today and to look at the court proceedings over the last decades would argue that very clearly. My colleague from Idaho has spent a good deal of time with water law. I am not a lawyer. I have not. But I do recognize a precedent when I see it and something that is new and unique to a very important body of law. I hope we can continue to work to perfect this. I do believe there is a very clear perverse incentive here that no person. nor public policy. should have embodied within it. I thank the Senator for yielding.",

Senator CRAPO. who now is in the Chamber. to see if we can come up with something that will meet his questions and some of his concerns. I have indicated to him that I certainly will not reject outright anything he has to say. I have an open mind and would be happy to visit with him. I have also indicated to Senator KYL that there is absolutely no question that this has nothing to do with changing State law. The Senator has indicated at a subsequent time he will submit to us some language. and we will be happy to take a look at that. if he believes this language in our legislation is not clear enough.

The State of Arizona and the State of Nevada were at war for about 3 years. a bitter water war. As a result of our help and the water expertise of the Senator from Arizona. and perhaps a little of my political work on the issue. we were able to work something out.

That is. even though we now have reached an agreement which will basically provide an optin situation in which the Governor of each State has the authority to determine whether his State or her State will opt into these provisions. the problem we face is that the States that choose to opt out or to stay out are then deprived of their ability to participate in this 1.1 million acres of CRP land that is being added to the CRP. There is a hammer there on the States now to either opt in or not have access to this expansion of the CRP. I have discussed this issue with the good Senator from Nevada. and I appreciate his willingness to work with me on trying to resolve the issue. He has agreed that we will try to work out the differences and. hopefully. be able to come forward with a unanimous consent request or some type of approach that is agreed to.

It is the intention of the prohibition on Iraqiorigin petroleum imports to terminate the imports. and they could then be addressed by the President and the President. after consultation with relative committees of Congress. can certify to the Congress that Iraq is substantially in compliance with the U.N.S.C. Resolution 687 and Resolution Resolution 986 prohibits smuggling of oil in circumvention of the Oil for Food Program. and 687 mandates inspections by U.N. inspectors. So the intent is clear. It is to terminate oil exports in the United States. The Senator from New Mexico suggested we contemplate and be somewhat sensitive to the attitude of the White House. I think during our extended debate on ANWR we had an extended discussion about the attitude of the White House that did not prevail in this body. I think what is germane. however. is the attitude of the White House with regard to the sanctions on Iran and Libya. They are quite clear. and I think there is a notable similarity. Those sanctions were initiated in retaliation to terrorist activities associated with Libya. What was it? The downing of Pan American flight 103 over Scotland. That is why we took that action. It was most appropriate. In Iran. in 1979. it was the Embassy takeover and the terrorist activities associated with that. So we have a parallel. I do not think there is any question about it. We terminated a relationship in the sanction action against Libya and Iran for fostering terrorism. If what is going on with Saddam Hussein is not an act of terrorism. I do not know what is. I indicated in my statement pretty much throughout. this is a matter of principle for the United States. I do not think there is any question about the justification. It is the same justification. Saddam Hussein is fostering terrorism. and I think we would all acknowledge that. So I think. with all due respect. that is the justification for this action.

I think the important thing to look at and see here is that we have a number of foreign students in the United States. and this has been a very positive thing. overall. for the United States and for the rest of the world. I dont think anybody would disagree with that statement. Yet what we have had taking place is a system that. over time. has gotten far too loose. and we saw the effects of that on September 11. where a couple of these individuals who came into the United States and did this operation. this horrific thing that happened. came in under student visas because they were looking for weaknesses in the system to get into the United States in a less restrictive. reviewed area. So that is why this has been at the very heart of this bill. Senator BYRD puts in a good provision. There have been sporadic reviews by the Government of the educational institutions to see that they are doing this right. that they are taking the program seriously and not just finding some way of being able to bump up their student account and the number of students coming to the United States. We will have a regular reporting requirement and we will be able to monitor this much more closely. It should not inhibit legitimate students from coming here. nor the institutions that are legitimate and serious about what their projects are. It will be a bit more of a hindrance to those looking to increase their foreign student accounts and. hopefully. it will help us to get at those students who are here to do us harm.

Nobody knows whether they are really at a school.

There are major changes in defense policy in this bill that may become law without debate. The rule to stifle debate is not just a procedural outrage. it is contrary to our national security. I offered an amendment to the Rules Committee that was not made in order that would have eliminated funding for a program in the bill that does not merit the support of this Congress. My amendment would remove $7.5 million added to this bill for the Kinetic Energy AntiSatellitealso known as the KEASATprogram. Like a giant fly swatter in space. this weapon would knock out enemy satellites. The Department of Defense does not support KEASAT. President Bush requested no money for it. Former President Clinton line item vetoed funding for it in 1998. Defense Secretaries. Pentagon weapons advisory boards and independent defense analysts have all called KEASAT a horrendous waste. The GAO. in its examination of this program called KEASAT a program \"in disarray.\" Yet we continue to fund it. This money was added to the bill without debate. and. unfortunately. we will not have the opportunity to debate it today. I ask my colleagues: How many other meritorious defense needs could benefit from that $7.5 million? Any one of us could write a laundry list of other. better uses for this money. both in and out of the defense budget. At this time. when our nations military is facing so many challenges. it is simply unconscionable to waste money on systems like this. I respectfully urge my colleagues to make my amendment in order and give the Members of the House the opportunity to work their will on this subject.",

In fact. the idea for this amendment arose at a breakfast we had with Secretary Rumsfeld at which there were complaints about limitations on their ability to manage the Pentagon. One was in the quality of personnel they have for financial management. the attraction of personnel with the requisite qualifications for handling a budget that is now approaching $400 billion. the certification of these qualifications. hiring. firing. I responded to that by calling Dr. Dov Zakheim. who is the comptroller of the Department of Defense. and telling him if he had problems like this. we were not going to be stinting about the cost of professional personnel in the Department of Defense. We need to raise the quality of management throughout the Federal Government and certainly in the Department that has the largest budget. I asked him to send me legislation of what he would like to have in the way of professional qualifications. certification. what he could reasonably require for those who worked in the Department of the Controller. He sent me some legislation. and we made a few minor revisions to it. We made some revisions primarily to make it prospective instead of retrospective so that nobody loses his job because he does not meet these new qualifications or these new certifications. Secondly. we worked with the American Federation of Government Employees to make sure that they were satisfied with the proposal we have got. This amendment is just a crucial first step to helping the Department of Defense improve their abilities in the area of financial management and their ability to track and account for the funding that Congress provides. The heart and soul. obviously. of any accounting system is the people it employs. This will enable the Department to raise the level. raise the bar in the qualifications for people who are attracted and hired in the Department of Defense for financial management. It is my understanding that the Committee on Government Reform has also vetted this legislation and supports it as well. I urge an \"aye\" vote on the en bloc amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services for the outstanding work he has done for our armed services. His leadership is going to be greatly missed. We appreciate the job he has done for America. My amendment. Mr. Chairman. would require that future regular reporting requirements imposed on the Department of Defense would have a sunset provision of 5 years after enactment. This would not apply to existing reporting requirements and only be applicable to new reports. including those in this bill. H.R. 4546. This amendment serves both Congress and DOD by ensuring that all future reports are reviewed regularly and remain relevant and responsive. This is endorsed by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. This legislation does not abdicate Congress traditional oversight role and will insist that the Department of Defense remain responsive to congressional requests and questions about their activities. Those reporting requirements deemed useful after 5 years can easily be reauthorized at the conclusion of the sunset period. Conversely. Congress must demonstrate responsibility in its oversight authority by limiting burdensome and unnecessary and unending reporting requirements. In fiscal year 2001. the Department of Defense was required to prepare 983 various reports to Congress. of which 449 are listed right here in this packet. This is simply a listing and a brief explanation of the 449 reports that are perennially required by Congress and stipulated year after year. The House Committee on Armed Services in conjunction with the Department of Defense has carefully examined these 449 reports and determined that only 20 out of the 449 were redundant. outdated or no longer relevant enough and should be terminated. Since it is unlikely that Congress will be unable to significantly reduce the number of existing reports. it is our goal to limit the future ones. Remember. each existing and future report is an unfunded and unprogrammed mandate that has proven extremely difficult to eliminate. The cumulative effect of these required reports is highly burdensome and costly. Limiting these requirements in the future will allow the military staff to concentrate more fully on their primary mission of national security. [E 1500",

First. it would commend the crews of the aircraft carriers that contributed directly to Operation Enduring Freedom and the homeland defense mission. Many people are aware that our aircraft carriers contributed to our initial actions in Operation Enduring Freedom. but most people are unaware as to the number of carriers and also the incredible effort and number of aircraft carriers it took to effect our initial response to the attack on September 11. Second. this amendment would recognize the full value and worth that our carriers have for Americas power and force projection capabilities. There is no doubt that the aircraft carriers have been integral to our war in Afghanistan. We have all heard the story of how the USS Enterprise turned around and went back when the captain heard about what was going on. Every munition and bomb dropped from a carrier air wing has been a precisionguided munition. The carriers worked around the clock after the attacks on September 11. Mr. Chairman. the Sense of Congress expresses a simple truism that is laid out in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Navy needs. at a minimum. at least 12 aircraft carriers. Mr. Chairman.

Section 245(i) is a vital provision of U.S. immigration law that allows some immigrants on the brink of becoming permanent residents to apply for their green cards while staying in the United States. rather than having to return to their home countries to complete this time consuming process. Unfortunately we allowed this law to expire on April 30. 2001. despite the fact that the INS said they had not had enough time to notify everyone who was eligible to take advantage of this status. Although I believe 245(i) should be permanent. extending it for 120 days through H.R. 1885 is a step in the right direction. If we do not extend this law tonight people who are fully eligible for green cards will be forced to return to their home countries and barred from returning to the United States for anywhere from 3 to 10 years. despite the fact that they have homes. jobs. and families here. I firmly believe that restoring 245(i) is profamily. probusiness. fiscally prudent. and a matter of common sense. It will allow immigrants with close family members here in the United States to stay with their relatives while applying for legal permanent residence. it will allow businesses to retain valuable employees. and it will provide the INS with millions in annual revenue with absolutely no additional cost to taxpayers. Extending section 245(i) will notgive special benefits to illegal immigrants and it will not allow anyone to cut in line ahead of others. Madam Speaker.

The White House has stated support for an extension of 245(i) for 6 to 12 months. and there is bipartisan legislation in both Houses of Congress for similar extensions. This new proposal of a limited 4month extension with restrictions has come to the floor without a hearing and without appropriate. fair consideration. It is not consistent with the spirit of President Bushs letter where he advocated for policies that strengthen families and recognized that there was not enough time with the previous fourmonth extension. In December 2000. when Congress passed a 245(i) extension that expired April 30. 2001. it took the INS over 3 months to issue the new regulation. causing great panic and confusion among immigrants and creating an opportunity for unscrupulous and fraudulent immigration \"advisors.\" This new provision. needing new regulations will only create more delay. chaos and unnecessary hardship on immigrants with real claims to legal status. A 245(i) provision helps people in this country who otherwise qualify for legal permanent residency. It is not an amnesty. but rather a way for people with deep roots in this country to reunite their families and work their way towards citizenship and full participation in their adopted country. A meaningful extension must go beyond 4 months and should not impose new arbitrary requirements. This proposed extension is a superficial and transparent political gesture. which recreates problems we are seeking to rectify from the last extension we passed. It appears to do something positive for immigrant families. However. I believe that it is a proposal that demonstrates that we have not learned anything from our previous mistakes. We need to pass and implement a comprehensive solution to families that are separated from their loved ones and not prolong. perpetuate. or further complicate their problem. While I fully support a 245(i) extension that provides real relief to families. I strongly stand in opposition to this hastily considered. incomplete and impractical proposal before us now.",

I am disappointed that H.R. 1885 will only allow the extension of 245(i) for four months. This small extension will not offer enough time for thousands of people to apply. Section 245(i) needs to be extended for a longer period of time because thousands of immigrants were not able to meet the April 30. 2001 deadline. I am also concerned that the new requirements of H.R. 1885 will force the INS to issue regulations that will take three months or more to be implemented. This will only leave people with a month or less to apply. H.R. 1885 also imposes unfortunate new restrictions on eligibility that will greatly limit the pool of potential beneficiaries. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has written a letter to President Bush stating our disappointment in H.R. 1885. In order to unite and strengthen families. we need a permanent extension of 245(i). A permanent extension will keep the maximum number of families united. help avoid fraud perpetrated against immigrants seeking assistance. and allow for a steady stream of funding for Department of Justice programs. This month President Bush sent a letter to Congress indicating his support of a six to twelve month extension of 245(i). I do not understand why the Republican leadership has chosen to advance a bill with only a four month extension when the Bush Administration clearly supports a longer extension. H.R. 1885 does not do enough to help immigrants in need. I hope Congress and the Administration can work together in the future to implement either a one year or permanent extension of 245(i).",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1885. a bill that will extend by four months the time for eligible individuals to apply for permanent resident status in the United States. While this bill does not extend the deadline by a year or make it permanent as I would prefer. it is a humane effort and a good first step to assist people eligible for permanent residency. To be eligible to apply for permanent residency. an individual must have family in the US or must be sponsored by an employer. However. under current law. eligible individuals cannot file while in the US. Instead. they must leave the country and file from abroad. By forcing people to leave the country. we are ensuring that lives areuprooted. families are separated. and valuable jobs are lost. Expanding Section 245(i) of the immigration code is necessary to keep families together and to promote steady employment. It would grant no special rights or status for immigrants but would instead clear an expensive and timeconsuming procedural hurdle for people already living in the United States who are eligible to apply for permanent residency status. As the deadline approached last month. INS offices across the country remained open for extended hours to allow eligible people to apply in the US. Almost all the people who apply are approved. therefore. we should extend the deadline. H.R. 1885 is a logical and humane response to a provision of the law that does not make sense and should be changed. It is my hope and understanding that although this bill does not make this section of immigration law permanent. Congress will act soon to enact further extensions.

This short time frame fostered the dissemination of wrong or inadequate information. Additionally. H.R. 1885 requires that an applicant seeking to adjust his status under 245(i) must prove that he was physically present on December 21. 2000. and that they established a familial or employment relationship that serves as the basis of their petition. Fulfilling this requirement is not an easy process. Obtaining the necessary documentation will require more than 4 months. At the April 30. 2001. deadline. 200.000 persons had pending applications. This is due partly to the fact that INS was not able to handle the tremendous influx of applications. Madam Speaker. a minimum one year extension of the filing deadline is imperative in order to fulfill the purpose and intent of the LIFE Act. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support a minimum oneyear extension of the filing deadline under Section 245(i). It is the right thing to do.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. it goes without saying that. as legislators. our goal is to pass the best legislation possible. Extending the deadline for people to adjust their immigration status under Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act is the right thing to do. In this case. the goal is to allow everyone who is eligible under the law. to obtain permanent legal residence. Unfortunately. I fear a four month extension is an incomplete remedy. Consideration of this legislation says volumes about the way business is conducted in the House. The Speed with which this bill has been brought to the floor was noticeably absent on April 30th. This House was uncharacteristically silent about the pending deadline. While Im pleased that we finally have the opportunity to talk about extending the deadline. Im concerned about the circumvention of the committee process and the noticeably shorter extension period. We have not had a fair hearing on the alternatives. such as the bill Congressman KING and I introduced after working closely with state and local officials in New York. that gives eligible people an adequate window of opportunity to adjust their status by extending the deadline by six months. The process of adjusting ones immigration status can be confusing and that misinformation is rampant in the immigrant community. As we cast our votes for or against this bill. we have to ask ourselves a number of important questions: is four months enough time. are we setting ourselves up for a repeat of the last deadline. when long lines of eligible people inundated the I.N.S. offices and many were excluded. and finally. is this bill a fair and reasonable compromise designed to help those who deserve it. I fear it is something less. We could have done better. The people deserve better.",

He was using the word manipulate. suggesting that we have to manipulate public policy. The drug companies are manipulating public policy in their patent policy and in the collusion with the generics. which is being addressed by the Schumer proposal. So we have a Republican Governor talking about manipulating public policy. I was interested in the fact that this should not be a partisan issue. The silence in support from the other side of the aisle is deafening with regard to the Stabenow amendment. I am hopeful there will be voices on the other side that will rise in support of this.

Senator KERRY erroneously characterized how the National Bankruptcy Review Commission voted on the small business changes that were contained in the bill. Senator KERRY maintained that the provisions were controversial and passed by a narrow 54 vote. This was not true. In fact. the National Bankruptcy Review Commission voted for these provisions by a vote of 81. I also want to clarify another point in the bankruptcy legislation. Senator SCHUMER offered an amendment in committee and then on the floor that changed a provision in the bill that prohibited corporate entities in Chapter 11 from discharging fraud debts in bankruptcy. I opposed this amendment since I think that corporations should not be able to commit fraud and get away with it by filing for bankruptcy. Nevertheless. to accommodate Senator SCHUMER. I reached this compromise which prohibits corporations from discharging fraud debts owed to Government entities or to plaintiffs under the False Claims Act. I want to make clear for the RECORD that I oppose letting corporations defraud private businesses and individuals. and then discharging those debts in bankruptcy. Hopefully. I will revisit this issue in the near future to make sure that corporate scam artists cant use bankruptcy as a safe haven. I also want to take this opportunity to thank a number of staff members that were especially helpful in getting this important bill passed: Rene Augustine. Makan Delrahim. and Sharon Prost of Senator HATCHS staff: Ed Haden and Brad Harris of Senator SESSIONS staff. Ed Pagano and Bruce Cohen of Senator LEAHYS staff: Jim Greene and Kristin Cabral of Senator BIDENS staff. Jennifer Leach of Senator TORRICELLIS staff: and Rita Lari Jochum and Kolan Davis of my staff. I also want to acknowledge my former staffer John McMickle who worked on this bill for several Vears.

When Rita was 18 months old she was left with the Daughters of Charity Society. a Catholic organization in Kampala. Uganda. Rita was an orphan. abandoned with no known family. Rita has resided in the United States under a student visa since 1994. As an orphan the only parents she has ever known are her American guardians. who have sponsored Rita since she was three years old. They want very much to adopt Rita. but they have been unable to get around the mess of international red tape. The Ugandan Government has very strict policies concerning adoption by foreign nationals. Now as Rita approaches her 16th birthday she is in danger of being deported. Rita has formed an intimate bond with her American parents. who hope to complete the adoption as soon as possible. Papers for adoption have already been filed. while there are bureaucratic difficulties. the adoption is not contested by any party. Understandably. the family is concerned that Rita will be deported before her adoption is finalized. This bill simply gives Rita permanent residency so that she might remain with the only parents she has ever known while her adoption becomes final. Other immigration scenarios would require Rita to return to an unsafe country for an unknown period of time. She has no known family in Uganda. Her new life is in California where she was recently admitted to Loretto High School. an outstanding college preparatory high school. This bill gives Rita permanent resident status. which will allow her to remain in the country while the adoption process continues. It allows Rita to stay with her American parents in the country that she now calls home. The bill also offers the comfort of certainty for her parents. I hope that we can move quickly to grant this relief. By Ms. COLLINS:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation to extend to Federal retirees and both active and retired military personnel the same health insurance premium conversion benefits allowed to current civilian Federal employees. This legislation directs the Office of Personnel Management to establish a system allowing those who participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. FEHBP. to pay their health insurance premiums from pretax income. The practice of allowing health care participants to use pretax income to pay their health insurance premiums is often used in the private sector as a way of recognizing the importance of adequate. affordable health insurance. This system is called premium conversion. Last year. the Office of Personnel Management recognized this concept by establishing a plan to allow most employees of the executive. legislative and judicial branches to participate in premium conversion. Many Federal retirees also participate in the FEHBP program and as a matter of fairness should be extended the opportunity to participate in premium conversion. In addition. the military currently has a separate health care system. but it is exploring offering health benefits under FEHBP. and therefore military employees or retirees who do participate in FEHBP should also be allowed premium conversion. I have heard from Federal retirees in Maine who have pointed out the unfairness of not including retired Federal employees in the premium conversion system. This legislation will address this inequity. I urge my colleagues to review and support this important legislation. By Mr. REID (for himself. Mr.",

Today. by reestablishing the SNOG. we are ensuring that the Senate will be fully informed prior to the next round of enlargement this November in Prague and in its consideration of ratification. On June 15. 2001. President Bush gave an historic speech in Warsaw. Poland at which he said that \"all of Europes new democracies. from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that lie between. should have the same chance for security and freedom. and the same chance to join the institutions of Europe. as Europes old democracies.\" His audience. the Poles. understood what he was talking about.

Becky Mills learned to love the great outdoors as a young child. Her grandfather took her on camping and fishing trips to Yosemite. where she interacted with Park Rangers around the campfire. and her participation in the Girl Scouts allowed her to explore more national parks: Yellowstone. Sequoia/ Kings Canyon. Grand Canyon. Zion. Bryce. Lake Mead. and others. Her lifelong interest in nature contributed to her decision to dedicate her life to protecting the environment.

Her decision proved to be beneficial for the Park Service and. ultimately. for Nevada. In 1995 Becky was appointed Superintendent of Great Basin National Park in Nevada. In this capacity. she worked to protect and enhance the natural and cultural resources of the park and the surrounding lands and community. To help preserve the parks history.

In this respect. donors should aggressively and relentlessly push for credible parliamentary elections next year. through which the Cambodian people can freely choose new leadership. In the postSeptember 11 world. America can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to authoritarian and lawless regimes. Just as Cambodia has become a haven for the Asian underworld. America should be concerned that terrorists and their finances will seek refuge in that lawless country.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise with pleasure today to commend the National Association of Letter Carriers. NALC for their unprecedented commitment to answering the call of reducing hunger in the United States. Over 30 million Americans go hungry everyday. In the summer months. the problem is particularly acute because the demand for emergency food is high and donations are at their lowest yearly point. However. on May 11. almost 62.7 million pounds of food was collected in the 10th Annual \"Stamp Out Hunger\" food drive as a result of the dedication of NALC members. Through a combined effort by the Priority Mail division of the U.S. Postal Service and the Campbell Soup Company. postcards promoting the food drive were delivered to over 100 million postal customers in all 50 States. the District of Columbia. Guam. and Puerto Rico. Then. on May 11. in addition to their daily postal duties. letter carriers volunteered to pick up donations. sort through them. and deliver the contributions to local community food banks. About 1.500 local NALC branches throughout the U.S. were involved in the drive. Others involved in the success of the nations largest oneday effort to combat hunger were SaturnUAW Union partnership Initiative. local United Ways. the AFLCIO. and Family Circle creator and cartoonist Bill Keane. The Campbell Soup Company donated one million pounds of canned goods. The National Association of Letter Carriers is the union of city delivery carriers employed by the U.S. Postal Service which has a long tradition of participating in community service.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to recognize a valued member of our Senate family. Matthew Evans. the Senior Landscape Architect here at the United States Capitol. who was recently honored by the National Arbor Day Foundation with their 2002 Good Steward Award. Through the years. Matthew has earned numerous awards including the American Society of Landscape Architects onceinacentury Centennial Medallion in recognition of the Capitol Grounds as a national landmark for outstanding landscape architecture. Gardens designed by him have been featured in films and magazines. These awards recognize him for his outstanding professional abilities and his invaluable contributions to our U.S. Capitol Building and Grounds. We are fortunate to have Matthews practiced eye and professional skill at work for us here at the Capitol. He and his staff are meticulous in the care they provide a preserve and enhance the grounds of this treasured national landmark. Matthew also collaborates with countless groups and representatives from other government agencies. civic organizational and community groups to ensure that the many important ceremonial and special events held on these historic grounds occur in a way that protects and preserves our invaluable greenery. Each day of the year. thousands of Americans as well as foreign dignitaries and guests tour our Capitol and grounds. Many of them linger to snap photos and to view the magnificent old trees and beautiful plantings here on our Capitol grounds. These landscape treasures add immeasurably to the memories our visitors carry away from their visits here. Matthew Evans now faces perhaps the greatest challenge of his career. He must protect. to the greatest extent possible. the trees and grounds of the Capitol during the construction of the new Visitors Center and then restore this historic property to its beautiful state. We all wish him well in this important endeavor. I congratulate Matthew on receiving the prestigious Good Steward Award and I thank him for his dedicated service. I am glad to know he will be continuing his skillful and wise stewardship of the invaluable architectural landscape legacy we enjoy here at the U.S. Capitol.*",

These students are finalists in the National History Day Contest. They are also among 15 students who have been selected from a national pool of 700.000 to display their work at the White House Visitors Center this week. National History Day is a yearlong event in which students prepare exhibits. papers. documentaries. and performances to explain not only the \"who\" and the \"what\" of history but also the \"why.\" \" In his performance \"Castro. Cuba. and the Revolution the World Will Never Forget.\" Michael Crowe. a seventh grader at Fruitvale Junior High School in Bakersfield. explores the relations between the United States. Cuba. and Russia during the Cold War. As part of his research. Michael spoke to former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and to CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite. He also gained a unique perspective on the era by interviewing the children of Fidel Castro and Nikita Khrushchev. Working together. eighth graders Jennifer McWilliams and Heather Scott. who also attend Fruitvale Junior High. created an exhibit entitled \"On the Trail to Revolution: Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam War.\" In addition to speaking with Robert McNamara and Walter Cronkite. the girls interviewed veterans. refugees. and a Vietnamese expatriate who lived in Vietnam durind the war to understand the conflict and its effects on our Nation. Like other National History Day participants. Michael. Jennifer. and Heather chose their topics last fall. They spent a year conducting extensive research and analyzing past events. Michael. Jennifer. and Heather then joined over half a million other students and entered their National History Day projects in local competitions. From these local competitions. approximately 2.000 participants are chosen to proceed to the national finals. There. they compete for cash and scholarships. Michael. Jennifer. and Heather are among this years finalists. an accomplishment remarkable in itself. However. these students also demonstrated great enthusiasm and superior effort while completing their projects. This earned them the privilege of exhibiting their work at the White House Visitors Center. Michael. Jennifer. and Heather performed truly firstrate research and demonstrated initiative and dedication beyond their years. Their projects are of exceptional quality. These young people have earned my sincere admiration. and I congratulate them on their achievements.*",

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 27. 2001 at Kent State University in Ohio. Mikell Nagy. an openly gay university student. was eating breakfast with friends when he heard someone make an antigay comment toward another friend across the room. When Mr. Nagy went to see if his friend was okay. a man walked up behind him. called him \"faggot\" and punched him in the face. According to witnesses. blood was pouring from cuts above his left eye and his two front teeth were chipped during the incident. I believe that governments first duty is to defend its citizens. to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law. we can change hearts and minds as well.*",

In fact. for 6 of the 8 years under Ronald Reagan. the Senate was Republican. so he was not faced with a Democratic Congress. I would have to say. however. that the gentlemans economics makes his history look good. He says under this tax scheme we will have enough for Medicare to restore it. In fact. that is the heart of what we are talking about. People talk about the money belonging to the people. and of course. it does. People have two sets of needs. They have needs that can best be dealt with individually. but they also have needs that can only be dealt with if we do them together. In my own district. I am often asked about funding for Superfund. for transportation. for law enforcement. All of these are being cut in the Presidents budget. The President tells people that he cannot afford. under his budget with this tax cut. to provide any help on prescription drugs for people who make more than $17.000 a year. He canceled. because of the need to pay for the tax cut. the Public Housing Drug Elimination program that provides police officers to be in the public housing projects. In fact. we have a terrible crisis in the provision of medical care. nursing homes. and home health care agencies. Hospitals all over the country are in difficulty. and it is getting worse. We underpay the hardworking people in these facilities. We have a terrible nursing shortage because women are no longer coerced into nursing. and now that they have a better choice of professions. we are not paying enough to attract them. This bill takes away from the people the funds that they could use to adequately fund Medicare. a prescription drug program. nursing homes. longterm care. None of those can be addressed without the revenues that this bill does away with. Now. I do understand that it sunsets the tax cuts. That is odd. When the Republicans were facing Bill Clinton as President. they said if they got in power. they would sunset the Tax Code. Apparently they misunderstood themselves. because this bill does not sunset the Tax Code. it sunsets the tax cuts.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. there is a real plot here in this Tax Code. In 1981. I do not think Ronald Reagan understood what he was doing. It was said for a long time that the Democrats are the party of tax and spend. The Republicans of the 1980s and 1990s turned out to be the party of borrow and spend. From George Washington through Jimmy Carter. the national debt that was accumulated for 200 years when Ronald Reagan took office was a little under $800 billion. The next 12 years of Republican Presidents and half that time. a Republican Senate. that national debt more than quadrupled to $4.3 trillion. David Stockman admitted why. He said they knew what they were doing. because only by deliberately creating multihundred billion dollar annual deficits can you politically withstand the demand of the American people for more health care. for decent numbers of nurses in the hospitals. for shoring up Medicare and Social Security. And what does this tax cut do? It is deliberately designed to create multihundred billion dollar annual deficits in the future. $4 trillion of tax cuts in the next decade if it does not sunset. so that we will be able to stand on this floor 10 years from now or 6 years from now and say. we have to cut Social Security benefits. we have to increase the retirement age. we have to cut back on Medicare. we cannot think about prescription drugs for Medicare. we cannot build the highways and bridges and roads we need. we cannot put the money into education. because we have a $300 billion annual deficit this year. Mr. Speaker. that is the purpose of this tax cut. because the people who are doing it really do not believe that government ought to fund Social Security or Medicare or prescription drugs under Medicare and all the other things. because the purpose of this tax cut and the effect of it will be. because it is so huge and we are told we have these huge surpluses for 10 years. 10 year surplus projections are about as reliable as 10year weather projections. If we pass this. we are deliberately creating multihundred billion dollar deficits in order to justify cutbacks in all of the programs that the people of this country want.",

I rise at 7:40 in the morning on a Saturday morning to get this work done. to get this work done as Americans are going to work all over the country. Those who have the day off may be watching what we do and wondering how it is going to impact their family. The truth is that American families can spend their money for the benefit of their family in almost all instances better than the Federal Government can. We are going to hear a lot. not only today. but in the future. and just did. about the projections of revenue. We never hear revenue projections questioned when we talk about spending. We only hear revenue projections questioned when we talk about giving the money back to the people who are sending it in. There is a tax surplus. and even after we return this much of that tax surplus. there is still not only money left to grow the government at a rate much faster than inflation. but a contingency fund beyond that and money to secure the trust funds in ways that did not happen here for 29 years. Mr. Speaker. we are balancing the budget. we are letting government grow at a rate that many Americans would argue is too high. it is higher than their businesses are able to grow. it is higher than their home budgets are able to grow. But what we are doing today is giving the tax surplus. the money we have said in every projection of Federal spending we would need. back to the families that are sending it in. Mr. Speaker. this is the right thing to do. This is the right day to do it.

He pledged to give people back their own money and there was this huge roar and there was silence among the politicians. because some people did not hear the roar.

The facts will show in fact that since President Clinton took office. every one of his budgets was less than the Republican Congress. which came in in 1995 actually appropriated. So I think what this is all about is trying to save us from ourselves. from the Republican standpoint. They are in control of the White House. they are in control of the House. but now what they want to do is to foist upon the American people a true bait and switch tax bill. This is unbelievable. If it did not sunset at the end of 10 years. it would cost $4 trillion for that next 10 years. So what do we do? We assume that we are taking savings. and that enables us to have deep tax cuts for the first 10 years. Let us look at those deep tax cuts. The estate tax. for example. that does not even do a good turn for the very rich. They have to wait 10 years before it is phased in. and then it sunsets in 2010. So in 2009. that is the death bubble year. That is the time they sell their inherited assets. but there is still a taxfree stepup in basis for capital assets in 2009. That is not up until then. People with real money realized what a stepup basis is. They realize this does very little for them. and in fact it does not take care of the gift tax. When we look at the marriage penalty. as the gentleman from North Dakota said earlier. the marriage penalty starts in 2005. It is fully phased in in 2009. In 2010 it is repealed. How can that be a high priority? When we look at the pension plan. we all voted in favor of it. That does not become effective until the latter part of this decade. Mr. Speaker. this is not a good bill for the American people. It is bait and switch. When they see what was foisted upon them. they will know that the right vote is no on this.",

They praise the Presidents leadership. and on that note I will join them. The Presidents leadership led to one of the most outstanding acts in the political scene of this year and perhaps this century when the gentleman from Vermont decided to switch parties. In his statement he said \"that in the past. without the Presidency the various wings of the Republican Party and Congress have had some freedom to argue and influence and ultimately to shape the partys agenda. The election of President Bush changed that dramatically. !] 0900 We do not live in a parliamentary system. but it is only natural to expect that people like myself. who have been honored with positions of leadership. will largely support the Presidents agenda and yet. more and more I find I cannot.

A felony statute for agriculture product smuggling is needed to reflect the serious impact these crimes have on our farmers and the entire agriculture industry. Recent breaches of the agriculture safeguarding system have proven the need for strong criminal penalties for organized smuggling: multiple exotic fruit fly infestations have decimated California and Florida. the Asian longhorn beetle has been found in New York and Illinois. the Asian gypsy moth has been introduced in North Carolina and Oregon. and plum pox from Western Europe has devastated peach production in Pennsylvania. This widespread invasion of foreign species requires a strong federal response. The consequences of failing to adequately combat agriculture smuggling are clear. Until recently. a 72 square mile area of San Diego was under quarantine due to an infestation of Mexican Fruit Flies. The quarantine effected 1.470 growers of at least 20 specialty crops. The Department of Agriculture has encouraged California producers to grow specialty fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the risk of exotic pest introduction from smuggled fruit. Yet. no pre or post harvest treatment for many of these crops has been provided by the USDA. As a result of 2 fruit flies. roughly 150 growers lost virtually their entire harvestestimated more than $3 million.",

The idea behind the Gold Star was that it could symbolize the familys devotion and pride in the ultimate sacrifice for their country made by their family member instead of the sense of personal loss that is represented by the traditional mourning symbols. The Gold Star Parents Annuity Act provides for an annuity of $125 a month payable to each individual who has received a Gold Star Lapel pin. which is awarded to parents who have had a child die honorably in service to our country. Payments are to be divided equally among parents when there is more than one surviving parent. The receipt of this pension will not deprive anyone of the right to any other pensions. benefit. right or privilege that they are entitled to under any existing or future law. Furthermore. these special pension payments will not be subject to any attachment. execution. levy. tax lien or detention under any process. I believe this measure would provide a needed increase in income for many parents who have lost children in service to our country. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation which will correct an unintended oversight in the federal administration of Native American housing programs. allowing Indian tribes to once again access LowIncome Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) for housing development in some of this nations most underserved communities. In the 104th Congress. the Native American Housing Assistance and SelfDetermination Act (NAHASDA) was signed into law. separating Indian housing from public housing and providing block grants to tribes and their tribally designated housing authorities. Prior to passage of NAHASDA. Indian tribes receiving HOME block grant funds were able to use those funds to leverage the Low Income Housing Tax Credits distributed by states on a competitive basis. Unfortunately. unlike HOME funds. block grants to tribes under the new NAHASDA are defined as federal funds and cannot be used for accessing LIHTCs. The fact that tribes cannot use their new block grant funds to access a program (LIHTC) which they formerly could access is an unintended consequence of taking Indian Housing out of Public Housing at HUD and setting up the otherwise productive and much needed NAHASDA system. The legislation I am introducing today is limited in scope and redefines NAHASDA funds. restoring tribal eligibility for the LIHTC by putting NAHASDA funds on the same footing as HOME funds. With this technical correction. there would be no change to the LIHTC programstribes would compete for LIHTCs with all other entities at the state level. just as they did prior to NAHASDA. This technical corrections legislation is a minor but much needed fix to a valuable program that will restore equity to housing development across the country. The South Dakota Housing Development Authority has enthusiastically endorsed this legislation out of concern for equitable treatment of every resident of our state and to reinforce the proven success of the LIHTC program for housing development in rural and lower income communities. I have joined many of my colleagues in past efforts to preserve and increase the LowIncome Housing Tax Credit program which benefits every state. and I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance of maintaining fairness in access to this program emphasized through this legislation and encourage my colleagues to support passage of this vital legislation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am joining with Senator MAX BAUCUS in introducing a bill that would make permanent the exclusion for employerprovided educational assistance under \ufffd 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 127 allows public or private employers to provide up to $5.250 per year to each of their employees in taxfree reimbursement for tuition. books and fees for job or nonjob related education. Section 127 is a purely privatesector initiative and the one vehicle that encourages employer investment and assistance in providing educational assistance to its workers. There is no bureaucracy administering this programit is run through the generosity of private sector employers who provide educational opportunities to their employees in the interest of raising workforce productivity and making their businesses more competitive. Like other types of benefits. \ufffd127 employerprovided educational assistance must be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis and may not favor highlycompensated employees. The Revenue Act of 1978 created \ufffd127 and established employerprovided educational assistance as excludable for any type of course. other than a hobby or a sport. Prior to 1978. only specific \"jobrelated\" education was excludable from taxable income. The provision has been extended numerous times since its inception. It is time for the exclusion to become permanent. I commend the leadership of Senator MAX BAUCUS for bringing this bill before the Senate and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill. I hope the rest of our colleagues in the Senate will join in supporting the enactment of this bill. By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:",

I rise today to pay tribute to Jamel Bradley as healong with Columbia native Aaron Lucasprepares to play his final home game as #10 for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks on Saturday. March 2. 2002 Senior Day. Leading college basketballs Southeastern Conference and ranking in the top ten nationally in threepoint field goals as well as setting the three point record at USC would be reasons enough to recognize senior Jamel Bradleys accomplishments. What is even more extraordinary is the path that brought him to these amazing achievements. At 18 months old. Jamel suffered an illness that kept his temperature at 106 degrees for three straight days. Although he recovered. 80% of his hearing was gone. As a child growing up in West Virginia. Jamel never felt he \"belonged in this world.\" The hearing aids in both ears were inadequate and only served to stigmatize him. It wasnt until he found basketball that he discovered a way to fit in with his peers. His success on the court led him to the USC Gamecocks and another lifechanging event. This time Jamel received programmable. omnidirectional hearing aids that restored 7580% of his hearing. For the first time he could remember. he heard birds chirping and clocks ticking. Jamels basketball accomplishments also took him to Rome. Italy last summer where he scored 33 points in the Championship Game of the Deaflympics. leading the U.S. team to a gold medal. This reinforced what Jamel had come to realizehis hearing deficiency would not and should not keep him from achieving his goals. That is a message that he enjoys sharing with deaf youth while serving as the role model he never had growing up. Recently the ESPN Sports Network brought his lowkey. inspirational style to a nationwide audience. Now his story has served to inspire children with disabilities across the country. Since Jamels story aired. calls and emails have poured into USCs Basketball office attesting to the impact his story has had on others. It had a tremendous impact on me. Mr. Speaker. I ask you and my colleagues to join me today in honoring Jamel Bradley. The contributions he has made both on and off the basketball court will leave lasting impressions on all those he has touched. He is a remarkable young man. I wish him continued success and Godspeed!",

Well before the failure of Enron. I had spoken out frequently on my concerns that fraudulent financial reporting and earnings manipulation by public companies was endangering the savings and retirement plans of many Americans. Now that Enron has made the systemic problems in our financial oversight and disclosure systems all too clear to everyone. we have an opportunity to adopt serious reforms to correct the weaknesses that are undermining confidence in our capital markets. Our bill will significantly enhance the independence and oversight of the accounting industry and puts on the table a full range of reforms to make real improvements in investor protection. The bill adopts the proposal made by former SEC Chairman Levitt in 2000 to separate audit and consulting functions by prohibiting substantially all nonaudit services that auditors have been providing to their audit clients. in addition to incorporating other significant provisions aimed at enhancing auditor independence. The bill creates a Public Accounting Regulatory Board to provide strong and effective oversight of the auditing industry. We provide this new regulator with explicit. broad oversight authority and a stable funding source to ensure it can take tough action to provide effective oversight of the auditing industry. including direct inspection of audits. The bill changes the way that auditors work with audit clients by ensuring that the audit committee is responsible for hiring and firing auditors. This has been advocated by five former SEC Chairmen as a way to make sure that auditors are clearly and directly responsible to the audit committee and shareholders. not to management. The bill restores both joint and several liability and aiding and abetting liability for auditors",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we close the chapter on February. Black History Month. I want to bring to the attention of Congress a man who has had a profound impact on the sport of ice hockey and its connection to communities of color. On last Sunday. the world turned its attention to the Olympic games to witness the mens ice hockey gold medal game featuring Team USA against Team Canada. At the conclusion of the hardfought battle. Team Canada emerged victorious by a score of five to two. Although I wished the score had been reversed. I was extremely proud of what that game did to increase the level of exposure for the game of hockey. I was particularly moved by the exploits of one player in that game and I believe that. over time. his participation may prove more beneficial to the sport of hockey than the gold medal game itself. The players name is Jarome Iginla. Jarome is an extremely talented young man who plays for the Calgary Flames. At the Olympic break. he was atop the leader board in overall points and goals and recently enjoyed his first appearance at a National Hockey League AllStar game. This past Sunday. Jarome played a critical role in Canadas victory by contributing two goals and an assist. It was truly a standout performance. However. it was not just his performance that makes him so special. Jarome is the first Black ice hockey player to ever have the opportunity to accomplish such a feat. While the NHL is considered to be one of the most diverse sports when considering national origin. it is still a predominately Caucasian sport. Currently. there are only thirteen Black players in the NHL. but there are efforts underway throughout the United States and Canada to introduce Blacks and other persons of color to this amazing game. Leading this effort is a man who has been a trailblazer when it comes to professional hockeys quest for diversification. While Jarome Iginla has become a pioneer at the Olympic level. William (Willie) ORee is the pioneer when it comes to the involvement of players of color in the sport of hockey.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1542. the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act of 2001. This important and timely legislation will expedite the rollout of highspeed Internet access across our nation. foster competition. and bridge the digital divide that separates neighbors. communities. and regions from the benefits of the information age. Opponents of this bill argue that it will unfairly favor certain technologies within the broadband industry. On the contrary. H.R. 1542 is designed to eliminate the unfair conditions which currently exist within the industry by offering consumers an expanded and guaranteed alternative to cable and satellitebased broadband technology. This legislation simply creates a level playing field for the different enterprises which comprise the broadband industry to freely and competitively offer their technologies to the American people. Moreover. opponents wrongly assert that by eliminating the prohibitive regulations that currently stifle rollout of DSL broadband technology. this legislation will destroy local service providers who enjoy reduced rates and access to existing technology as set forth in the 1996 Telecommunications Act. On the contrary. H.R. 1542 does not prevent local exchange carriers from accessing any existing or future customer using the telephone network. However. to ensure local competitors are fairly and adequately protected from the change in the 1996 law. I fully support the BuyerTowns Amendment. This amendment further protects the local competitor by guaranteeing their continued right to access highspeed data services over fiber lines as they presently do. It is evident that H.R. 1542 is good for America. Our future competitiveness in the global market depends on our access to and utilization of data and information systems. which begins at the individual level which this legislation addresses. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to vote yes for expanded access by voting yes to this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is difficult to believe that once again. the House of Representatives is leaving Washington without passing an Unemployment Assistance extension bill that could be in effect by the time we return next Tuesday. The Senate has passed the extension bill several times. But the House Republican leadership refuses to take that bill and send it to the President for signatureunless it is loaded up with unjustified and very detrimental tax cuts for the most affluent Americans and corporations.. a bill that the Wall Street Journal declared \"mainly padded corporate bottom lines.\" And so. once again. Congress leaves Washington without doing its job for the men and women who send us here to represent them and whose taxes pay our salaries. That may not be very important to our Republican leaders who run this House. But it surely is important to the 378.000 working men and women who filed new unemployment claims last week who wonder if extended benefits will be there for them when their meager weeks run out. as they have for over I million Americans between September 11 and December 31. 2001 and 11.000 more every day of this year! When we left Washington without passing extended benefits for the Presidents Day recess. over a quarter million Americans lost their unemployment benefits. By the time we return next week after being gone for nearly five full days. another 55.000 left high and dry by this Congress and by the Republican leadership that uses them. and their suffering. as leverage for fat cat tax breaks. Mr. Speaker. where is the compassion of the Republican leadership? Why can we not have a straight upordown vote on the Senates bill to extend unemployment benefits as we have been urged to do by 9 Nobel laureates who say these benefits are the quickest and surest stimulus we could enact? Lets stop the political gamesmanship. get the assistance to the men and women who paid for it with their labor. and then we can continue the debate over tax cuts for the wealthy.",

Pennsylvania is one of those individuals. and I would like to take this opportunity to honor and commend him and his colleagues for their tremendous generosity and benevolence. Dr. Alley. through his nonprofit organization. World Blindness Outreach. has organized a team of doctors for an annual journey to Nicaragua for the past four years to provide free eye care and eye surgery to those who cannot afford such procedures. Helping him are William Busch. a physician from Pensacola. Florida. Eduardo Miller. a physician from Mexico. Richard Simmons. a physician from Westerville. Ohio. Bill Hoffman. an optometrist from Lebanon. Pennsylvania. Ron Johns. an optician in Dr. Alleys office. and Cheryl Strauss. an operating room technician from the Lebanon Outpatient Surgery Center. Not only do they provide the service. but they provide all the necessary tools and materials required to do that service because the hospital they work out of in Nicaragua cannot afford the equipment. This past January. these hardworking doctors spent a week working tenhour days removing 85 cataracts and correcting 12 cases of strabismus. Already. they have plans to continue with this mission of goodwill in March to the Dominican Republic. Dr. Alleys dedicated passion and ability to spread his amity among his colleagues is a talent which we all endure to achieve. He is indeed a leader whose charitable work and medical help for those who cannot afford it serves as an inspiration to us all. As a perfect example of how giving is contagious. two women in Nicaragua. inspired by the work of Dr. Alley. collected $100 to donate to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani after hearing of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. D.C. this past September. Though this donation may not seem large by our standards. it was collected from individuals whose average annual income is $500. With the utmost respect and admiration. I commend Dr. Alley. Dr. Busch. Dr. Miller. Dr. Simmons. Dr. Hoffman. Dr. Johns. and Ms. Strauss in the noble and altruistic healthcare they provide to the citizens of Nicaragua. We hope his energy and motivation will proliferate among other medical professionals.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to call attention to a brewing crisis in southern Africa that threatens the lives of millions of men. women. and children. The scourge of hunger and malnutrition is far too common around the world. yet there is compelling evidence that we should be particularly concerned about what is taking place in six different countries. The World Food Program reports that many families in the region have resorted to eating such foods as unripe melons and poisonous berries just to have something to fill the stomach. The numbers are staggering7 million people require immediate assistance. and this number is expected to rise to 13 million by the end of this year. When people are so desperate to eat that they harvest their unripe crops and consume their seed corn. it is time that the world takes notice and lends a hand. Mr. Speaker. the causes for the worst food crisis in southern Africa in more than a decade are many. Irregular rains and prolonged drought have upset the rhythm of the planting season and destroyed crops. The HIV/AIDS crisis has seriously harmed the productive capacity of many families since in some areas up to 20 percent of the adult population is infected with the virus. The frailty caused by preexisting malnutrition has exacerbated the effects of hunger and disease. And corrupt governments have sometimes disrupted food production and distribution. As the breadbasket of the world. it is imperative that United States increase our efforts to provide immediate assistance to the millions of starving people in southern Africa. Mr. Speaker. we also must address the root causes of this crisis. We need to promote more efficient farming methods. such as improved irrigation and new agricultural technologies. We need to encourage good governance and political stability in the region. And we need to address the HIV/AIDS crisis in the region. But for now. we must do what we can in the short term so that we can save as many of these people as possible.",

Yet hes not living up to his promise. And were letting him get away with it. At yesterdays press briefing. a reporter asked An Fleischer why the Administration was opposing any addons to the antiterronsm bill. Fleischers response was: Well. the Congress has entered into an agreement with the President. many weeks after September 11th. when people already understood the need to beef up on the domestic front. the need to provide more resources. And an agreement is an agreement is an agreement. Doesnt that statement apply to the agreement the President made regarding New York? Isnt an agreement an agreement an agreement? We must provide the funds New York needs to rebuild. We must remember this was not an attack on New York it was an attack on America. And we as Americans must help the City recover their costs directly related to the World Trade Center attacks.

Mr. Chairman. the bill before us provides the funding for national defense for the fiscal year 2002. The base bill. which is the fundamental consideration today. involves some $317 billion for national security. and. Mr. Chairman. I would like the entire body to know that this bill was prepared and we were taking it to the committee on the very day of the tragedy that occurred in New York. All of us watched with horror as that first plane hit that first tower and then in amazement. fear. and anger as we watched the second plane and the subsequent results. Over these several weeks. the Nation has reacted in a fashion that all of us have watched with great interest. for indeed America had been attacked. and for the first time since World War II. more Americans were killed by a foreign agent in a single event than had been killed in our history. As we observed that scene. America first responded in fear. responded in anger and in frustration. and over these weeks and months now. we watched as our public has come together in a kind of unified response that says directly to the Congress. we expect you to help America be ready to deal with this war on terrorism that the President is so ably leading us to wage at this moment. Subsequent to this bill. the base bill of $317 billion. as the gentleman from Florida suggested. there is a supplemental appropriations that affects defense that is slightly in excess of some $20 billion. We do not know. we cannot be sure. this may be but only the beginning. for the war on terrorism could indeed go beyond months. into years. but there is little question about our publics commitment. We will carry forward this war against terrorism. and we will win this war. Mr. Chairman. at this point I would like to insert into the RECORD a summary of the provisions of Division A of this bill. that is. the Defense Appropriations bill.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I support this bill. but believe we have missed an unprecedented opportunity to transform the United States military. The attacks of September 11 and the threat of anthrax across the country have shown that threats to U.S. security no longer come just from tanks and bombs. The war in Afghanistan demonstrates that the military increasingly relies on information superiority. longrange power projection. stealth technology. and precisionguided munitions. It is time to invest more in a defense for the 21st century. and to move away from unneeded bureaucracy and outmoded platforms. We must transform our military into a more flexible. multifunctional force. We need technologies for intelligence gathering. more robust use of uninhabited vehicles and longrange platforms. President Bush promised in his campaign to skip ahead to the next generation of military technology. Where is the transformation? The Quadrennial Defense Review talked grandly about progress but put its money into funding the status quo. It was as true before September 11 as it is now that enemies will use asymmetric means to exploit American vulnerabilities and use terror to inflict both psychological and physical damage. Our defense must reflect the revolution in military affairsin weapons systems. in bureaucratic organization. and in military infrastructure. We must improve the \"toothtotail\" ratio of fighting capability to support structure. Most importantly. defense spending on specific weapons or strategies should be proportional to the likelihood and seriousness of the threats. Mr. Speaker. we all know that resources are limited. We risk buying less defense for more money if we buy the wrong things. Now that the public is tuned in and the stakes are higher than any point in our history. we fail to act at our own peril.",

This Member would like to offer particular thanks to the chairman of the Subcommittee on Department of Defense Appropriations. the distinguished gentleman from California . and the ranking minority member on the Subcommittee on Department of Defense Appropriations. the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania . for their work on this important bill. Additionally. this Member is pleased to thank the Committee on Appropriations for including $3.8 million in fiscal year 2002 for the Air National Guards Project ALERT. Currently. Project ALERT serves as an online training tool developed and used by the Nebraska National Guard in collaboration with the Department of Defense. the National Guard Bureau. the University of Nebraska. and Nebraska Educational Television. The $3.8 million appropriated in H.R. 3338 will assist with the completion of the initial development and implementation phases. Indeed. the implications of Project ALERT extend nationwide and to components of both the active and reserve military forces. Allowing military forces to complete some training courses on their own time. as Project ALERT does. provides an opportunity to cut onsite training costs and time and to maximize exercise time. For the U.S. military to meet the challenges it will face during the current war on terrorism and throughout the 21st century. it is crucial that Congress invest in innovative and flexible training tools such as Project ALERT. In closing. Mr. Chairman. this Member urges his colleagues to support H.R. 3338.",

As our courageous military servicemen \"fight the good fight\" in Central Asia today. there is hardly a more pressing time for the passage of this bill. The amount of $317.5 billion. $19 billion over last years level. is an important first step in both waging the war on terrorism and addressing readiness shortfalls that have been years in the making. Especially important in this bill is the $1.7 billion addition we added for a \"rapidresponse capability\" for the war against terrorism. I also applaud the Appropriations Committee for providing for $7.9 billion for ballistic missile defense. an increase of $2.7 billion over last year. Combating weapons of mass destruction could never be more important than it is today. Mr. Chairman. I am also pleased to inform my constituents of military construction projects previously passed totaling more than $52 million to be located in Oklahomas Fourth District. Military installations in my congressional district are on the front lines of the war against terrorism. and this bill helps address some of the more urgent needs at these facilities.

With their help we will continue to root out and destroy the terrorist networks that threaten peaceful nations throughout the world.

Now is not the time to close training facilities for our military. It is a long and tough road ahead for us as we rid the world of those terrorist elements who wish to do us harm. We must be fully prepared to meet those challenges and that means using the resources that we have. not stripping our military of vital bases. The tragedy of September 11 has given American an opportunity to do some soul searching. As we struggle for answers. we must not let our resolve grow weaker. We must always remember this tragedythe enormous pain and suffering it has causedand work to make our nation and this world a safer and more peaceful place.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of the KucinichLee amendments to the FY02 Defense appropriations bill and urge my colleague to vote in favor of this excellent amendment. Since the horrible events of September 11. Americans are more concerned than ever about our national defense. They want to know that our national leaders are working to ensure their safety from terrorist attacks. Protecting American lives must be our top priority as we address these new threats. In this new context. it is critically important that we prioritize funding for those threats most likely to endanger American lives. The KucinichLee amendment wisely allocates additional funding to respond to weapons of mass destruction. It increases funding for Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams to ensure that every state and territory can respond to a chemical or biological weapon attack. It would also provide much needed funding for development and production of vaccines against biological agents. Finally. the amendment provides additional funding for the NunnLugar counterproliferation programs to prevent the spread of nuclear material from the former Soviet Union. As we prioritize those threats that pose the greatest danger to Americans and those solutions that are most cost effective. it becomes quite clear that a National Missile Defense (NMD) system is not an effective use of our resources. The KucinichLee amendment would eliminate some of the accelerated NMD programming. while leaving in place a significant increase in NMD funding. While I firmly believe that the entire proposed $7.9 billion in NMD spending would be more effective if applied to other priorities. the KucinichLee cut of $786.5 million is a good start in using this money more effectively. By cutting funding for construction of the \"Pacific Test Bed\" ballistic missile defense facilities. we maintain our compliance with the Antiballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. which has been the foundation for nuclear arms control. I urge my colleague to adopt the KucinichLee amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. through the passage of the Buy American Act and other related laws. Congress has consistently instructed Federal agencies to buy products made in the United States whenever possible. Congress passed these laws not only to support American manufacturers. but also to ensure that in times of international conflict the United States would not be dependent on foreign sources for products necessary to protect this Nation and its interests. We are now engaged in a campaign overseas fighting terrorism. Furthermore. we are faced with new threats on our homeland as well. Now. more than ever. we cannot afford to become dependent on foreign manufactured products that are essential to our national security. We need to maintain a domestic manufacturing source for these products. I can give you an example of this need in my own district. The Ansell Perry Glove Plant in Massillon. Ohio has been making surgical gloves since 1935. Its parent company. which is owned by an Australian holding company. is moving this facility over to Asia. Once it moves. there will no manufacturers of surgical gloves in the United States. I am trying to persuade the department of defense to keep buying Americanmade surgical gloves. so that this profitable facility can remain open. The department has tremendous buying poweraccording to the defense logistics agency. it purchased nearly 3.5 million dollars worth of surgical gloves in FY 2001 alone. This amendment is intended to reemphasize the intent of Congress that federal agencies like the Defense Department should buy American and that in a time of conflict and danger. like we find ourselves in right now. it is vital that these agencies keep a domestic manufacturing source for products that are essential for protecting our citizens at home and our troops stationed abroad.",

Michael Selves served this great Nation as both an officer and civilian with the United States Army.

Rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before leaving military service. he was admired and respected by superiors and subordinates alike as a gifted and caring leader of soldiers. His numerous decorations include the Legion of Merit and three Meritorious Service Medals. As a Department of the Army civilian. Mr. Selves brought his leadership skills to the office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. His vast skills were quickly recognized as he was appointed Director of the Armys Information Management Support Center. Under his leadership. a cohesive team of information technology professionals was formed that produced the highest score for customer satisfaction within the Pentagon. The actions of his subordinates in the hours immediately following the attack on the Pentagon attests to his leadership.

Congressman Terry was a gentleman. a committed family man. and a dedicated public servant for the people of New York and the Communities of the Syracuse region. Jacks life. filled with significant accomplishments. began with his success at Notre Dame and the Syracuse Law School. His long. distinguished career included his law partnership with Smith & Sovik and subsequently as the senior vice president. general counsel and secretary to Niagra Mohawk Power Corp.. for the Hiscock & Barclay law firm.

He served for five years in the New York State Assembly and thereafter was elected as the representative of the people of New Yorks 34th Congressional District in 1970. I had the honor and pleasure of working with Congressman Terry during my very first congressional campaign. He played a key role in my campaign activities and assisted me in organizing my Washington congressional office. During my first year in Congress. Jack provided me with invaluable guidance and friendship as my mentor. During World War II. Jack Terry was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. for his courageous service. As a veteran. he was an ardent supporter of our men and women in uniform. My wife. Georgia. and I. join all of Jacks family and friends in sending our heartfelt condolences and prayers to his four daughters. Carole. Susan. Lynn. and Jean. his grandchildren. and the entire Terry family. We know that mere words can no way assuage their sense of loss. However. we hope that they can take some comfort in the rich and fruitful life jack lived and the way the world embraced his charitable spirit. May the knowledge that many of us share their loss be of some consolation to the Terry family. Jack Terry was a staunch advocate and an outstanding public servant for the people of his region and the state of New York. His dedicated service was a testimony to his life.

After reviewing Mr. Andersons distinguished legal career. I can tell you that he is a fine jurist who will add a great deal to the Federal bench in California. Following graduation from UCLA School of Law in 1975. Percy Anderson served as a Directing Attorney and Staff Attorney with San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services. representing indigent clients in civil matters. In addition. he helped less experienced lawyers with trial preparation and courtroom presentation in matters before the Superior and Municipal Court in Los Angeles. He then acted as a consultant for the Legal Services Corporation in the District of Columbia. before taking a position as an Assistant U.S. Attorney of the Criminal Division in Los Angeles. For the next 6 years. he served as First Assistant Division Chief. supervising other attorneys and managing criminal division affairs in the absence of the Division Chief. He joined the Bryan Cave law firm in 1985. specializing in white collar criminal defense and aviation litigation. particularly products liability. In 1996. Mr. Anderson became a partner with the Los Angeles firm of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal. He focuses his practice on trial and appellate litigation in the areas of commercial matters. intellectual property. products liability. false claims. and white collar criminal defense work. Mr. Anderson has home State support and my support. He will make an excellent Federal judge in California.",

Still. as was the case 10 years ago. I have every confidence that John Walter will serve with distinction on the Federal District Court for the Central District of California. After reviewing Mr. Walters distinguished legal career. I have no doubt that he will be an asset to the Federal bench. Mr. Walters solid experience in private practice and government service deserves attention here. Upon graduation from Loyola University of Los Angeles School of Law in 1969. Mr. Walter joined the Los Angeles. CA. firm of Kindel & Anderson as a civil litigation associate. Mr. Walter later served as an assistant U.S. Attorney In the Criminal Divisions Fraud and Special prosecutions Unit. where he prosecuted numerous Federal criminal cases. including the thenlargest bank burglary in the United States. He returned to Kindel & Anderson in 1972 and remained there as a civil litigator until 1976. Since that time. Mr. Walter has been a partner at the Los Angeles firm of Walter. Finestone & Richter. Mr. Walter exemplifies an attorney who gives back to the community. As a member of the Federal Indigent Defense Panel. Mr. Walter has represented more than 75 indigent defendants charged with federal crimes in Federal court and devoted thousands of pro bono hours to these cases. He has served as a judge pro tempore in the Santa Monica Municipal Court and as an arbitrator for the L.A. Superior Court Judicial Arbitration Program.

We have used it successfully in the State of Illinois for years. About a third of our gasoline supply is blended with ethanol and is used safely. So I say to the Senator from California. speaking only for myself. I accept her challenge. I believe we can establish across the Nation that ethanol is a safe fuel. not only safe for those who would handle it and those who would use it in their cars but safe for our environment. I see no reason for us to put language in this bill creating any kind of exemption from liability for ethanol or renewables fuels.

Again. we were told over and over again. the Department of Energy says. yes. there will be a 9cent increase per gallon in certain places and 7 elsewhere. That was wrong. it would only be a penny. Senator FEINSTEIN made the point we have had some bad experiences with collusion in the area of our electricity. If there are only four or five people who make the product. we could have problems.

So for port communities such as New Orleans and Houston and New Jersey and New k York and Seattle. where maritime workers could qualify. this amendment will help. It only costs $10 million. It lasts for only 3 years. Out of an $8 billion bill. our maritime workers deserve some help. They have earned it. they deserve it. That is what my amendment does. Thank you. Mr. President.",

The steady leadership the Senator has provided on this issue has been admirable. and I certainly hope the message has gotten through. It would be a serious mistake indeed to think that an agreement or package of agreements can be successfully presented to Congress for approval. under fasttrack rules or otherwise. if it includes any weakening changes to our trade remedy laws. I believe the Senator has accurately captured the general definition of a \"weakening\" change. and I agree fully with the examples he has laid out. I want to ask about some other proposals which have already surfaced at this early stage of the WTO negotiations. and which in my view must be rejected under the standard set out in section 2(c)(9). These proposals include: One. changes to the rules for \"sunset\" reviews of antidumping and CVD measures which would make it more difficult to keep relief in place. two. additional constraints or criteria for dumping calculations. in areas where current WTO rules and U.S. law vest discretion in the administering authority. and. three. special rules and standards that would make it easier for a particular group of countries. such as developing countries. to utilize injurious dumping or subsidies as a means of promoting their own industries at our expense.

I believe that the language and the coverage are clear. but want to make sure that our negotiators are well aware of our intent and coverage of this legislation and the expectations we have for inclusion in future trade agreements. Reasonable people know that fresh meat is perishable. but many people may not be aware that livestock can be perishable as well. Cattle ready for slaughter. for example. must be processed within two to three weeks of reaching their optimal weight. Once above the optimal weight. cattle gain fat and not muscle. With this quality loss. livestock producers suffer drastic price discounts that can wipe out their profits. Clearly meat production and livestock are also cyclical.

No reasonable person would suggest that the definition of perishable and cyclical agricultural products would fail to cover livestock and meat production. TPA also calls for improving import relief mechanisms to recognize the special characteristics of perishable and cyclical products. which would include livestock and meat. Such improvements to import relief mechanisms could include faster and more effective time frames for imposing import relief measures as well as improved means of determining industry support in import relief investigations. Along the same lines. TPA provides that U.S. import relief measures for perishable and cyclical agricultural products should be as accessible and timely as those of other countries. TPA also states that the U.S. Trade Representatives. prior to commencing negotiations concerning agriculture. shall work to develop a position on perishable and seasonal products that will lead to an international consensus on the treatment of these products in dumping and safeguard investigations \"and in any other relevant areas.\" I understand that livestock and meat production would be included in these negotiations as they are clearly covered under the definition of perishable and cyclical agricultural products.",

Many of us are appalled and deeply concerned by this order. Our Nation and the rest of the world need to register the strongest possible condemnation of this outrageous regulation. As our resolution points out. the world has not been witness to anything like this since the Nazis required the Jews to wear a yellow Star of David. The Talibans repression of women and its intolerance of other minorities goes hand in hand with other reprehensible behavior. It is not surprising. therefore. that the Taliban provides Osama bin Laden. the terrorist kingpin. a safe haven. allowing him to reside in Afghanistan as its special guest. Bin Laden is responsible for much of the terroristrelated murder and mayhem that has shattered peace throughout the subcontinent. It is his thugs that killed our State Department employees and hundreds of other innocent people. The Taliban and bin Laden appear to be made for one another. Moreover. the Talibans involvement in taxing. stocking and the trafficking in opium make it responsible for much of the global misery related to drug addiction. Finally. it is an open secret that Pakistan in many ways supports the Taliban. It is appropriate. therefore. that this resolution calls upon Pakistan to use its influence to demand that the Taliban revoke its edict that identifies Hindus and other nonMuslims. Accordingly.

It was billions and billions of dollars of Marshall aid which resulted in the rebuilding of Western Europe and in creating our allies in NATO. and providing us with a prosperous Europe as our single most important trading partner. So this melancholy call for isolationism is not supported by the historic evidence. The historic evidence shows clearly that in Republican and Democratic administrations. overwhelmingly United States participation in Europe and elsewhere contributed in a major way toward building democratic and prosperous societies. I was present at the end of the Second World War. as my friend knows. when Europe was in ruins. and it was the farsightedness of a group of Republican and Democratic leaders in this country. from Harry Truman to Senator Vandenberg. who created a framework which allowed the countries of Europe to rebuild themselves to become our powerful NATO allies. our democratic friends. and our most significant trading partners. There is no evidence for the statement that the previous administration directed aid to go to the Taliban. This is an unsubstantiated statement. What we voted for and what I think we will vote again is to provide humanitarian assistance to the destitute people of Afghanistan. It is most unfortunate that the bulk of Afghanistan today is in the hands of this despicable regime. But I think it is important to realize and to be true to historic facts that the bulk of our economic aid since the end of the Second World War has succeeded in creating prosperous and democratic societies ranging from Taiwan to Denmark. These were destroyed societies. poor societies. destitute societies. and American aid was critical in building them up as democratic and prosperous allies.",

The findings in these reports on the Taliban exemplify a clear pattern of basic human and civil rights to the Afghan people. especially women. minorities and children. The statistics of violence against women and giris is simply overwhelming. Not only is the Talibans record on human rights atrocious. the State Departments Pattems of Global Terrorism reports that \"The Taliban continued to provide a safehaven for international terrorists. particularly Osama bin Laden and his network. in the portions of Afghanistan it controlled.\" Not only does the Taliban house Osama bin Laden. the Taliban allows Afghanistan to be used for a base of operation for worldwide terrorist activities and training. The people of Afghanistan are being held hostage in their own country under the terrorist regime of the Taliban. Their recent policy of requiring Hindus to wear identification badges. mandating Hindu women to fully cover themselves in veil. demanding Hindu homes to be identified. and prohibiting Muslims and Hindus to live together all further exacerbate the current situation and indicate that the Taliban is trying to implement a genocide against their own people. I urge Pakistan to step up to the plate and use its influence to allow Afghan Hindus to continue to live their lives and practice their religious beliefs and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important resolution.",

We have pledged ourselves to having attempts to preserve rural America. and I commend my cochairman of this caucus. the gentlewoman from Missouri . and the gentlewoman from North Carolina for their leadership and dedication to the rural caucus on issues that matter to rural residents across this country. Our job as members of the Congressional Rural Caucus is to promote economic and social policies that support the continued viability of our rural communities. In many instances throughout my State of Kansas our rural communities continue to struggle. We continue to see populations in oncethriving communities decline across the Great Plains. Of 105 Kansas counties. 61 have smaller populations today than in 1900. 82 Kansas counties have lost population since just 10 years ago. and 65 counties are predicted to lose population in- the next 10 years. Kansas communities are confronted with serious challenges of prosperity and survival. While working on the farm bill. Mr. Speaker. we hope there will be a strong component for rural development in that farm bill. And as parts of the rural caucus. I chair the task force on telecommunications. Seems awfully important for us to make certain that the provisions that are often available in more urban areas of our country are made available in rural communities as well. Our communities survival depend upon access to increasing technology. Mr. Speaker. by providing one voice for rural America. the Congressional Rural Caucus will ensure that rural communities will remain viable and competitive. Our job in Congress is to raise the awareness of rural issues and to preserve that way of life. As Congress debates important issues like rural development in the farm bill. and access to telecommunication technologies. we must address the opportunities and challenges that we face in rural America. Rural Americans across the country need us to demonstrate our commitment for a better quality of life. and I urge my colleagues to join us in this fight and to speak out for rural America.",

I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 23. a resolution to authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States and its citizens. September 11. 2001. will be a date that will live forever in the hearts and minds of freedom loving people. On that date our country was attacked by terrorists in a way thought impossible. Thousands of innocent men. komen. and children were murdered. It has touched the lives of thousands of families and of all Americans. It was an attack on our people and our freedom. The resolution before us authorizes the President to take the appropriate action including if needed the use of our military against those nations. organizations or people who planned. authorized. committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11. 2001. The resolution specifically directs that such action be targeted to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such entities. Mr. Speaker. we have an obligation to protect the safety of our citizens. particularly those within our own country. This resolution helps us carry out that responsibility. Our military force must only be used when it is clearly justified. This resolution limits that use to respond to the September 11 attack on our Nation. It is not only justified. but there is no more legitimate use of military than to defend ones country from acts of foreign attack. The resolution recognizes the role and responsibility of Congress in authorizing and committing our military to hostile action. The Constitution provides that the Congress has the power to \"provide for the common defense\" and the power to \"declare war\". The resolution strikes the right balance between the President and Congress and is in compliance with the War Powers Act. making it clear of the Presidents obligations to consult with and inform Congress. Now is the time for Congress to act. Let those who were responsible for these horrible deeds know that the Congress and the President and the American People are united and are resolved to bring the perpetrators to justice and to prevent such acts from ever happening again on our shores.",

He was appointed to the Federal bench by President Carter in 1979. and served the Southern District of Illinois until his death in July of this year. Judge Beatty touched and influenced not only the lives of his colleagues and fellow attorneys. but also everyone who appeared in his courtroom. He was known for his integrity. honesty. and fairness. and his courtroom was known as a place where justice would be done. In his personal life. he was a devoted husband and a loving father. I am privileged to have known Judge Beatty. and I am honored to sponsor this bill. It is a fitting tribute to a dedicated public servant whose career will be remembered for his fairness. consistency. and dedication. both to his job and to the area. It is fitting and proper to honor the outstanding public service of Judge Beatty with this designation.",

I want to take a brief moment of our time today to give my hearty thanks to the U.S. Capitol Police and all the other people who work with us and protect us day in and day out. Since the tragic events of September 11th. the U.S. Capitol has been the center of threats both physical and biological. Our Capitol Police have seen their overtime and workloads grow two and three times what they were before the tragedy. We depend now more then ever on their hard work and commitment to our safety. But this pace is overwhelming and could. in time. seriously damage moral. As a former fighter pilot. I am well aware of the impact the increased operations tempo during the 1990s had on the U.S. military. Repeatedly. our nations military men and women were asked to serve longer and longer tours away from their families. This continued pressure led to record retirements and gaps in manpower that we are still working to replace today. Our Capitol Police are now facing similar demands. While we work to give them the tools and resources they need. we should take a moment to give them our thanks for their commitment to protecting the people who visit and work on Capitol Hill. However. it isnt just the Capitol Police who are looking out for us. All over Capitol Hill there are people working for us everyday. From our personal office staff to committee staffs. from the janitors. mailroom clerks. and parking security staff. All over Capitol Hill there are people who come to work everyday and face the threat of just working in the Capitol. but they face it bravely and stand defiantly to keep us running. I am reminded just how committed the people are each morning as I drive to work. As long as I have been here Tommy Maggio. a parking security officer in the Rayburn garage. always greets me with the same smile and commitment to duty. He had done this job for 29 years regardless of the circumstances or threats facing Congress and America. All the people like Tommy keep Congress up and running.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I am pleased that the House is considering H.R. 4 today. This legislation is the first step in the development of a comprehensive national energy strategy. Included in H.R. 4 is an amendment I offered at the full committee markup to have the Department of Energy conduct a study and review of the Federal Energy Savings Performance Contract Program. This program is an existing and innovative program that provides Federal agencies the opportunity to fund the installation of necessary energy efficiency measures. As the single largest consumer of energy. our Federal government facilities offer a significant opportunity to help us meet one of our national energy goals--increased efficiency. Our experience has shown that many of these government facilities have aging and energy inefficient equipment that require modernization in order to allow them to operate at peak efficiency. We have learned over the past 10 years in the implementation of this program. like so many other government programs. that \"one size does not fit all.\" I believe that there are barriers and obstacles in current law and regulations. including some unnecessary red tape that prevents some Federal agencies from participating in the program. If flexibility is increased. this program could be used more effectively by Federal agencies. It is important that we take a look at the program. determine what barriers or obstacles exist. and implement appropriate changes. This provision provides for a 6month review. report to Congress. and requires the Department to implement appropriate changes to increase program flexibility and effectiveness. As part of this report and review. it is our intention that the Department of Energy will consult with outside parties that have experience participating and working within the program as well as other Federal agencies. I am hopeful that the end result of this effort will keep us on the road to increasing our nations energy efficiency. and that the Federal government will indeed be a large contributor to this effort.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. we are in the midst of an energy crisis brought on by years of ignoring the potential problems. During the next 20 years. U.S. oil consumption will increase by 33 percent and the demand for electricity will rise by 45 percent. At this rate. the demands for energy will far outweigh the supply if we do not enact a comprehensive energy plan. With that I urge my colleagues to support the Securing Americas Future Energy Act which emphasizes conservation. infrastructure upgrades and further development of traditional fossil fuels. I would like to take a moment and focus on some of the conservation aspects of H.R. 4. This bill provides a tax credit for residential solar energy use. which not only encourages the use of solar energy but it will reduce electric bills and the load on the electric grid. Through tax incentives. H.R. 4 also encourages the development and use of clean cars by increasing technology and reducing costs. Studies indicate that 275.000 alternative fuel vehicles will be purchased because of this bill. reducing gasoline consumption and the effects of greenhouse gases. Conservation is also emphasized in H.R. 4 through tax credits for energy efficient appliances. homes and businesses. Use of super energy efficient appliances in all households would save more than 200 trillion BTUs. which is equivalent to taking 2.3 million cars off the road. If all households upgraded their insulation. electric consumption would be reduced by 7 percent. As you can see. this bill provides valuable tools to promote conservation among Americans. I realize. Mr. Chairman that conservation alone will not go far enough. but neither will drilling. In fact. 37.5 percent of this bill stresses conservation. while 23.8 percent focuses on production and 38.7 percent on reliability. That is why I urge my colleagues to support H R. 4 because it is a wellbalanced plan that provides for the future energy needs of America.",

At a time when this country is wasting a huge amount of fuel and electricity. this bill provides $34 billion dollars in subsidies and tax breaks for the big oil. coal. gas and nuclear companies to drill for more oil and gas and to produce more and more energy. These companies are making record breaking profits by gouging consumers. destroying our environment and threatening our health. Can anyone tell me why we need to give more corporate welfare to ExxonMobil. the most profitable company in the history of the world with a net income of $17.7 billion. while providing little more than lip service to energy efficiency and renewable energy and absolutely no relief to middle income Americans struggling to pay their energy bills? Mr. Chairman. this is outrageous. We simply cannot drill our way out of this mess. At a time when emissions from dirty coalfired power plants produce acid rain and carbon dioxide that threatens our global climate and our health. at a time when scientists throughout the world believe that we have an enormous amount of work to do to combat the danger of global warming. at a time when wind energy is the worlds fastest growing source of energy and when the price of solar energy has been coming down in recent years due to better technology. I find it outrageous that the best we can do is to study whether our country can get to 5 percent renewable in the next 15 years. Mr. Chairman. we dont need a study on renewable energy. the studies have already been done. The technology is already there. What we need is a firm commitment. I tried to offer an amendment to require that 20 percent of our nations electricity come from renewable sources of energy such as wind. solar. and biomass by 2020. Unfortunately. the Rule Committee denied the opportunity for debate on this amendment. While renewable. nonpolluting wind power has been the worlds fastest growing energy source in recent years. wind energy contributes less than I percent of the national supply of electricity in the United States. and renewable energy only 1 percent.

    "speech": "I would appreciate a clarification on comparing the Presidential setaside on foreign availability with the enhanced controls. the former section. section 212. and enhanced controls is under 201. I will ask a question in a moment. I know the Senator knows that under 212. the Presidential setaside. if he determines that failing to control an item would constitute a threat to the national security. the President can set aside the Secretarys determination of foreign availability. Then it requires the President to pursue negotiations. as the Senator hs described. It requires the President to notify Congress that he has begun such negotiations. The President shall review a determination at least every 6 months and notify the committees. Then. 18 months after the date. the determination is made: if the President has been unable to achieve an agreement to eliminate foreign availability with these other countries he is negotiating with within the 18 months. then the setaside is lifted. But when you come over here to enhanced controls. it seems to give the President broad authority to lift the application of provisions of. in this case. foreign availability. I take it from what the Senator said a moment ago he thinks with enhanced controls the President would still be required to enter into the negotiations with foreign countries. for example. And. if so. which of these other provisionsthe notifying Congresspresumably the cutoff would not apply. the 18month cutoff. I am a little curious. if the President has enhanced controls. you would think that would obviate all of these other reporting conditions and negotiation requirements and things of that nature because that 18month requirement certainly would be obviated. and it would make the requirements under the setaside unnecessary. Will the Senator comment or give me his view on that? There is a lot of legislation here. I have referred to it once. We will have an opportunity to discuss it.",

The Presidential setaside of foreign availability status determination. which is section 212. is designed to encourage the President. in a foreign availability issue. to achieve. if possible. a multilateral agreement through international negotiations. And that is sort of spelled out in there as part of the purpose. You know. we emphasize negotiations. the reports to the Congress. the periodic review of determination. and the expiration of the setaside at a certain period. although he can renew it for 6 months over three times. for an 18month period. Over and above that. the President is given an enhanced control authority in section 201(d). That is on page 183. section 201(d). Let me read that because I think it makes it clear that. without being bound up in the process of section 211: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title. the President may determine that applying the provisions of section 204 or 211Section 204 is the parts and components section. \"Incorporated Parts and Components. is section 204. Section 211 is. of course. the -Foreign Availability and MassMarket Status\" sectionthe President may determine that applying the provisions of sections 204 or 211 with respect to an item on the National Security Control List would constitute a significant threat to the national security of the United States and that such item requires enhanced control. If the President determines that enhanced controls should apply to such item. the item may be excluded from the provisions of section 204. section 211. or both until such time as the President shall determine that such enhanced control should no longer apply to such item. The President may not delegate the authority provided for in this section. That is a pretty farreaching authority. We seek the Presidents determination on that. Then the only report is. the President shall promptly report any determination described in paragraph 1 along with specific reasons for the determination to the Banking Committee in the Senate and the International Relations Committee in the House.",

As a general proposition. for the sake of transparency. for rationality. for understanding in the export community what is being done. the sort of standard way of proceeding. so to speak. on both foreign availability and mass marketing would be to follow the procedures in 212 and 213 which have been worked out and are designed. as I said. certainly in the case of foreign availability. to accomplish the objective of trying to develop multilateral negotiations. So this is the process you set out to be followed. Conceivably. that is the process which. generally speaking. the executive branch would pursue. But in a sense. in an abundance of caution. with respect to national security and foreign policy interests. we give the enhanced control power to the President contained in 201(d). There he doesnt have to go through these notices. He doesnt have to go through these procedures. He is not bound into a timeframe. But you dont simply do that. If you just did that and nothing else. you would have. in a sense. sort of a process without any sort of standards or review. We have a process of standards and review. But then we go on to say. as I said. with an abundance of caution. that in any event the President can exercise the 201(d) authority. That is essentially to take care of the argumentactually. I think the Senator used the phrase earlier in his statement about unintended consequences. This is really to foreclose any unintended consequences in sections 212 and 213 by giving the President this broad authority contained in 201(d) on enhanced controls.",

By meeting in this venerable hall in lower Manhattan just blocks from where the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed less than one year ago the United States Senate and House of Representatives have demonstrated our governments lasting commitment to the people of New York. And by fighting back and emerging stronger than ever. New Yorkers have demonstrated their grit. their courage and their determination. On September 11. 2001 New York took our enemys best shot and never waved or faltered. The police officers. fire fighters and all the rescue workers who raced into the inferno demonstrated unsurpassed courage and set the tone and standard for our nation and the world. Just as significantly. the families of the brave men and women who were murdered that day just because they went to work in the World Trade Center have demonstrated a class and dignity that defy comprehension. None of us will ever forget where we were or what we were doing when we first heard the news of the terrorist attacks of September 11the attack on the World Trade Center. the attack on the Pentagon and the bringing down of Flight 93 in Pennsylvania by uncommonly heroic passengers. Nor will we forget how our nation rallied behind President Bush as he commanded the war against international terrorism. That war will be waged on many battlefields and in many ways for many years to come. But we know that America will prevail. It will prevail in large part because of the fighting spirit that rose from the flames and smoke which engulfed lower Manhattan. And it is that spirit that the United States Congress has honored and acknowledged by holding this extraordinary session in Federal Hall. God Bless America.",

In 2003. communities throughout the United States will celebrate the 100th anniversary of Korean immigration to the United States. Many Korean immigrants came to the United States in the early 1950s. fleeing from war. poverty and the threat of communism. As the hope to return to a united and democratic Korea diminished. Korean immigrants were left to build new communities and opportunities for themselves in the United States. It was through sheer determination and hard work that many Korean Americans have been able to thrive in America. invigorating businesses. churches and academic communities throughout the United States. According to the United States Census. Korean Americans own and operate 135.571 businesses across the nation that have gross sales of $46.000.000.000 annually and employ 333.649 individuals. Korean Americans have also left an indelible mark in our communities and government. Korean American community activists such as Angela Oh and Bong Hwan Kim worked tirelessly to bridge the racial tensions during the Los Angeles riots of 1992. The KoreanAmerican population of the U.S. has greatly added to the rich fabric of our Nation. I want to take this opportunity to commend Korean Americans for their historical and cultural contributions to this Nation. and again urge a YES vote on this resolution.",

Senator CHAFEE is taking a lead role in creating a bipartisan alternative to the parts of our committee bill that dealt with this question.

Congress has refused to enact commonsense legislation to prevent these kinds of senseless acts. As part of the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Project HomeSafe represents one of the largest and most diverse trade associations in America. Since September last year. Project HomeSafe has toured 16 States and visited over 300 communities. distributing hundreds of thousands of firearm safety devices in an effort to improve and preserve the lives of our children. This month. they reached the great State of Indiana. In conjunction with our Lieutenant Governor. the Honorable Joe Kernan. Project HomeSafe launched a 35day tour of Indiana. during which they will distribute 40.000 gun safety devices across the State. I want to commend the Department of Justice for providing the $5 million grant to enable this kind of activity. From March 1 to April 4. Project HomeSafe will be working with the Indiana State Police to help distribute the trigger locks at WalMart lots and KMart lots across the State. Indiana residents can receive a free firearm safety kit that includes a cablestyle gun lock and a safety brochure detailing the safe storage of firearms. To reinforce Project HomeSafes safety messages. the firearms safety tour will travel through Indiana visiting 29 communities. using a 16foot mobile classroom truck designed to provide safety education at the community level. Indiana residents will be able to pick up their firearms safety kit. watch a safety video. and view a display of the safe storage equipment. A safety tour coordinator will also be available to answer any questions. Indianas children will be able to visit the mobile classroom and will be encouraged to take the Project HomeSafe Pledge. which is a pledge presented to parents by children to show their commitment to safe firearms.

Chief Warrant Officer Harrimans courage in the face of danger reflects his character. a character born of his personal commitment to his Lord as a committed Christian and to his family as a committed husband. father. brother. and son. We owe Chief Warrant Officer Stanley Harriman a tremendous debt of gratitude. His courage. character. and commitment to freedom are an example to all of us. It is important that we not only remember Stanley as an excellent and dedicated soldier and Christian family man. but also as the American hero that he is. May God bless him and his family and those who have served with him. May God bless our great country. We indeed are a better Nation because of men like Stanley Harriman and those who serve with him in our Nations Armed Forces.",

We are saying that to increase our debt ceiling without a plan for getting us back into balance is irresponsible. We are prepared to vote to increase the debt ceiling short term. We do not want to see our country default on its debt. We do not want that. no one wants that. But we do believe it is irresponsible for us to blindly follow an economic game plan that has squandered $5 trillion of surpluses without first dealing with the problems of Social Security and Medicare. We think that is irresponsible. And we hope that as a majority of this House puts together their budget. this year we would hope that we could be a part of It. We are here tonight saying that if you participate in a budget process that gives us a plan to get us back into balance in a reasonable period of time and that keeps us in balance. we will support it. We will support it. But we will not support increasing the debt limit by $750 billion by not only continuing down the plan area that we are into tonight but actually making it worse as the budget that has been presented to Congress projects to do. That. we will not do. I yield to the other gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Ross). one of our newer Blue Dogs. to discuss this issue that we bring before you tonight.",

Why the majority leader chose to do this on the excuse that somehow it was contentious. to me. fails the true test of this body. of being a deliberative body that considers debate as part of the process. and certainly the value of education from the standpoint of Members of the committee to proceed. The majority leader knows as well as I do that the reason it was pulled from the committee was that we had the votes to vote out a certain contentious amendment. and that was to open ANWR. The majority leader simply pulled it. I think if he would refer to comments made by the chairman of the committee. which I would be happy to quote later on in the debate. he would see that the chairman of the committee didnt have anything to do with it.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this past Tuesday the State of Wisconsin did something no other state has done. and something this chamber has failed to do. Wisconsin did what was right and decided to help unemployed workers by extending their unemployment insurance benefits for an additional 8 weeks. They did it without playing political games or attaching controversial measures intended to score political points but not help Americas workers. Only a few short days after September 11. Congress quickl. rushed to rescue the airline industry and provided a $15 billion package. This package provided airline executives with a guarantee that their million dollar salaries were safe. but included no provisions that helped the thousands of airline workers who were being laid off at an alarming pace. The economic downturn. combined with the terrorist attacks. has caused many people to lose their jobs. Our unemployment is at its highest rate in about a decade. Yet. the House passed an economic stimulus bill that included millions of dollars in special tax breaks for big corporations. including Enron. but left behind those who needed financial help the mostAmericans who have lost their jobs. I applaud the State of Wisconsin for providing unemployed workers financial help for an additional 2 months while they look for a job. That means the people of Wisconsin will also have another 2 months to make their car payment. pay their house mortgage. and feed their families. I believe we must extend this assistance to all outofwork Americans. It is our responsibility. our duty. to make sure that all unemployed or displaced workers have their benefits extended. Today. this House had an opportunity to pass a bill that would have extended unemployment benefits to unemployed workers and gotten a prompt signature from the President. Sadly. tying unemployment benefits to another socalled economic stimulus bill will cause it to meet the fate of the previous 2 bills this House passedit will go nowhere. We should follow Wisconsins example and pass legislation that extends unemployment insurance benefits for at least another 13 weeks in a standalone bill. To do so otherwise is to turn our backs on the American people.",

The 16th of February is the most important national holiday for Lithuanians. Eightyfour years ago Lithuania declared their independence from Germany. At this time its government held two main principles. restore statehood and the right to national selfdetermination. Even after 50 plus years of Soviet occupation. these principles still hold true for Lithuania today. As soon as they established their independence in 1991. they have been working towards their goal towards NATO. the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I am pleased that Lithuania has shown as much tenacity and discipline in its membership action plan program as it did towards achieving freedom. All indications show it will be a significant contributor towards the Alliance. Since 1994. over 1.000 Lithuania troops have served in NATOled missions in the Balkans. Lithuania has expressed strong political and diplomatic support for the U.S. antiterrorist campaign. and it is ready to contribute its military and medical unit as part of the Czech hospital to the operation in Afghanistan and a military security unit within the Danish contingent to Kyrgyzstan as its practical contribution to the \"Enduring Peace\" operation. Moreover. Lithuanias current experience and positive relations with its neighbor. Russia. are poised to only get better once Lithuania receives an invitation to join NATO. I congratulate the people of Lithuania on their Independence Day for their hard work and perseverance. and I extend these greetings to all Americans of Lithuanian descent.",

The election in Florida was a quagmire of confusion and delusion. in that the election in Florida cannot even be compared to Haitis elections. Haiti elections were much better run than the election in Florida. There were so many circumstances that happened in Florida. in this Nation. In this Nation. where we have all the technology in the world. in this Nation where we have all of the leadership in the world. to have an election that some people were denied the right to vote is a travesty of democracy. The Haitian election was much better run. But did we censor this country because of it? Were we able to get any redress of our grievances? No. Were we able to come before this very Congress to show the situation in the election and show them what a bad situation it was. how it defied democracy? No. we could not get any redress. And it was a wellkept secret. the many. many problems in Florida. So it is so difficult to even compare it with Haiti. It does not even come up to the standards of the election in Haiti and some of the other underdeveloped countries as well. So. no. I do not see why we would use that. We are making it a political football because we do not want to help Haiti. and it is strictly political. There are people even in our own Congress who have fought against Haiti for the entire 10 years I have been here. I have never been so wrought up in my life as I have been coming to this Congress appealing for some help for Haiti. We can get it for other countries. and many of them. in my opinion. who do not deserve as much help as they are getting. But Haiti. one of the poorest countries in the world. cannot get any because of the political nuances or the political deepseated feelings and hate and despise people have for Haiti. I cannot understand it. And it is important that we help America understand that these few people are keeping their foot on the necks of Haiti.",

As a result. a lot of development was done in a rush with tremendous mistakes. not attending to zoning and not attending to proper drainage. and so forth and so on. So the experience of Florida has been quite the opposite of their experience. What I would like to do is to learn from them how I could help them because we are all citizens of the United States of America. I thank them for bringing this issue to the attention of the Senate. I look forward. maybe perhaps this summer. to visiting in their respective States of North Dakota and Nebraska.",

I would like to begin by saying that the gentleman deserves a lot of credit. along with the gentleman from Michigan . having been in the lead on this fight. You are both on the committee of jurisdiction. the Committee on Education and the Workforce. and I think you have done a great job on leading this issue. Whenever we do these Special Orders. it sometimes occurs to me that we sometimes may be talking around or over the heads or past the listening audience. I thought maybe it would be worth just a couple of minutes to explain some of the concepts here. I know that I get in discussions where I use the words \"tax credit.\" or I use the word \"deduction.\" and people do not understand. I mean they do not want to say. I do not understand what you mean. Congressman. But in America. with the withholding structure that we have where both wages and taxes are withheld out of your check. you file a form at the end of the year and you get a check back from the government. I think a lot of people do not really understand what a tax credit is and what a deduction is and why there is such a critical difference. I think it might be important to kind of walk through the fact of what this would mean for. as the gentleman pointed out. any taxpayer in America who even does not have a child. let us say they are used to filing their tax return and they get a check back from the government saying that they have overpaid their income taxes for the coming year. Let us say they get a check back right now of $1.000 in a given year. and that is because they owed everything else that they had paid in. except that $1.000. This is not a deduction that reduces the amount of money on which they have to pay taxes. this is rather a reduction. a lowering. of the dollars that they must pay in taxes themselves. So a tax credit means they get. they actually get money back. whether their check refund is larger or whether they write a smaller check to the government at the end of the year. is that not correct?",

What we are saying is that if you make a $500 contribution to a school. to a school project or a scholarship fund. you take that $250 that you have given to a school and you no longer send that to Washington. So you are going to pay that money to somebody anyway. What we want to do is give you a choice. You can send the money to the bureaucracy here in Washington. let it go through the political process that we described here before. or you can add a little bit of your own cash to it and take it to the school down the street. which is reflected here on this chart.

Because we have not reduced the amount of money going to education by $250. we have increased the amount of money going to education by $250 that would not have been there to begin with. And if $500 went to education. not $250. and in a sense we know that out of the $250. only 65 cents out of each dollar would get to the student. we have. as we said earlier. more than doubled the amount of cash going into education. which is why teachers across America. teachers unions. school superintendents. school administrators. people who are professionals and care about resources for education ought to be excited about this idea.",

Having your taxes withheld every week makes this a very attractive. or not attractive. but it is the process that is there. and they have been doing it for years. But this process is very. very difficult for our local school district. They have to clamor with the State. they have to raise a ruckus with us to make sure that they get their fair share. and then they have all the bureaucracy that goes with it.

There is no bureaucracy. there is a lot of flexibility with how the money is spent to make sure that at the end of the day. what do we want? We want this American child to be the best educated child in the world. It does not mean that we do not want other kids and the rest of the world to be as educated as well as they are. we do.

Our goal and our objective is to have ours to be the best educated kids in the world.

D.C. and does not want Federal money of any kind going out to educate kids without those Federal dollars being controlled. and the control of them. and the dictate. saying they must spend it this way. coming from Washington. D.C. It seems to me. given that. that one has to either oppose additional funding for education or genuinely believe that the people back home in the local schools and school districts cannot spend the money unless they are told precisely how it must be spent by Federal bureaucrats. Unless one believes one of those two things. one ought to be supporting this kind of idea. because it means more dollars for education. more local control. it means more involvement by Americans in the funding of education in a very direct sense. where they want the accountability to them and they get the satisfaction of knowing their money is helping education.

The Senator from Michigan is right. Over 99.5 percent of estates will not be subject to an estate tax. When the Senator from Arizona was present. he said .this issue called QFOBI. which is the method by which you value the assets of familyowned businesses. is totally unworkable. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that businesses can easily qualify for this special status as long as the family owns and operates the business and intends to continue to do so. Lets say you have a $200 million family business. a big one. In my judgment. if it is family owned. it goes to the lineal descendants. If they want to continue to operate it. no tax. We repeal the estate tax for that transfer. If. however. there are not lineal descendants who want to operate itone lives in California and one in Florida. one in Texasand they want to sell the assets. they have the same $8 million exemption that we would provide in this amendment.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1542. and as chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet. I would say that today. in fact. is the defining moment in our Nations telecommunications policy. Yes. the issues are complex. but there certainly is much at stake. The choice in this debate could not be simpler or clearer. Todays regulation of broadband is based on yesterdays technology. So we can either seize the moment and move forward. or we can stay stuck in the outmoded regulatory rut and watch other countries take our jobs and industry away. Recently. I had the opportunity to chat with the head of the Southwestern Michigan Realtors Association. and it was no surprise to learn that the number one question on the minds of prospective home buyers in Michigan these days is not about property taxes and local schools but. rather. whether there is broadband access available in the neighborhoods. These folks are willing to commute. in fact. more than 30 minutes. even across State lines. just to live in communities which have broadband. Small businesses in the area are reporting similar competitive disadvantages as well. I compare broadband access to the interstate highway system which was built through southwest Michigan back in the late 1950s and 1960s: and as I crisscross my district. I can see the population and the economic growth which has occurred in these towns that have access to interstate highways. Those communities which do not have access have remained in a virtual time capsule. great little towns. but they virtually stood still throughout the past number of decades. That is what I fear will happen if we do not move soon. as soon as possible in fact. to get these communities connected to *the highspeed Internet access highway. That is why we need to provide deregulatory parity for broadband. regardless of the platform by which it is delivered. whether it be telephone lines. cable. wireless. satellite. and by doing that we can undo the enormous regulatory shackles which stand in the way of telephone companies providing DSL.",

Mr. Chairman. to paraphrase Charles Dickens. this is a tale of two cities. the cable and telephone industry. Ten years ago. these two industries had little to do with each other. but today. they are. thanks to technology. they are providing the exact same product. highspeed Internet access. One would think thus that when the government imposed regulations it would do so in the same manner. but that is the crux of this tale of two industries. One. the cable industry. provides these services unfettered by regulation. the way it should be. and I support this. The other. the telephone industry. is heavily regulated. We have a responsibility to ensure fairness in our regulations. Luckily. there will be great benefits realized as a result of this legislation. It is estimated that $100 billion will be spent upgrading the telephone networks. There is an enormous amount of labor involved in this task. and as a result. the AFLCIO and the Communication Workers of America have endorsed this legislation. Small businesses will also benefit. The cost of a T1 line can be as much as $1.500 per month. For a small business that is simply not an option. but a DSL line is about $50 per month. Certainly that is affordable for most small businesses. and that will allow them to finally join the ecommerce revolution. There will also be enormous benefits to bridging the digital divide. Our modern society is dependent upon information. The Internet is the greatest source of information ever created. Again. I urge a \"yes\" vote on this bill. It will bridge the digital divide and allow this kind of service to be for all Americans.",

Without this bill. we will not have broadband deployment in rural America. and we will not have the jobcreation activity. and we will see the people continue to offer broadband in urban America and not in the places that we need job growth. The other issue is that we have seen what has happened in the voices with the FEC and the lawsuits. the CARA lawsuits. the rulemaking. and that just stops the deployment of any type of service. And here people want to return to that. They want to bring more regulation into this new. exciting world of highspeed Internet services.

The only problem is it is handicapped. handicapped and handcuffed by outdated regulation that prevents the deployment of broadband. and deployment of broadband is clearly the wave of the future. Small businesses in particular will need deployment of highspeed Internet service. They will need it for large bids. They will need it for largevolume orders. They will need it to put pictures up that people can get in a quick and rapid manner so that they can sell their products. That is why we need to deploy broadband now. We also need more competition with the cable companies. Everyone talks about cable rates and talks about competition. Well. we can have competition if we pass this bill. Broadband will provide that competition. Third. we talk about the digital divide. the fact that we have two communities. some that have it and others that do not. This committee did a good job on a bipartisan basis by guaranteeing a 5year buildout to ensure that urban as well as rural communities. poor communities as well as wealthier communities would have access to broadband Internet under this bill. I think that is a tremendous idea. and I think it argues well for this bill. We cannot afford to have businesses leave poor communities because they do not have broadband. We cannot afford to have students in poorer communities disadvantaged because they do not have broadband when their wealthier colleagues do.

If it passes and becomes law. it will determine the way the telecommunications industry develops in America for untold years to come. Yet we are provided with essentially 2 hours. or less than 2 hours to debate the bill in its essence on the floor here today. The opposition is given. what. 15 minutes to provide alternative points of view. This is scandalous. The people are not being served here. There ought to be opportunities to debate this bill in its full content and in detail. Why is that? Because the bill. as it is currently written. makes some terrible mistakes. The premise of the bill is that if monopoly situations are provided to monopolistic companies and get rid of all regulation at the Federal and State level that somehow we will have a fair and open process and a level playing field and that somehow consumers will get the benefit. History shows us different. This bill will cause prices to rise. and it will ensure that vast areas of the country continue to not get service. Particularly rural areas like upstate New York will not get the service that they need. The bill alleges to create jobs. Well. the CLECs in New York. for example. now employ about 100.000 people. Those jobs are in danger of being lost and almost certainly would be lost if this bill were to become law. This bill is not in the interest of the general public. not in the interest of consumers. We could do a good bill. and if we were doing a good bill. we would do many things.

This bill seeks to and does in fact. as it is to be amended. allow for the best of both worlds.

As a member of the House Committee on Armed Services. I frequently discuss the importance of redundancy in our information infrastructure. Redundancy is essential to a strong national defense. Because if our information only has one path to travel. times of emergency can make it difficult for information to travel at all. Redundancy in our system is essential to ensuring confidence in our information infrastructure during times of emergency and to plan for information technology growth in the future. TauzinDingell will use both the carrot and the stick in encouraging telephone companies to expand our highspeed data transmission infrastructure. thus making our country less vulnerable to a communications shutdown in times of emergency. When there are two highspeed networks capable of handling the broadband needs of the country. both cable and telephone. one could be pressed into service if the other is disabled. The bill we vote on today requires the phone companies to equip all their local offices with highspeed data transmission within 5 years. Without this legislation. neither the incentive nor the requirement will be there for the Bell companies to expand their networks. Nineteen percent of our country has no highspeed data service at all. and 48 percent have only one network in place. That leaves twothirds of the country without a redundant highspeed data network. Mr. Chairman. this leaves our country vulnerable and exposed to an information shutdown during a national crisis. TauzinDingell will not cost taxpayers one penny but will create over a million new jobs. give millions of Americans access to highspeed Internet and. most importantly. will strengthen Americas information infrastructure.

I congratulate the more than 8.000 Catholic schools that serve this nations students. I am a product of Catholic schools as a graduate of Holy Family High School in Birmingham. Alabama so I know first hand about the value of a Catholic school education. According to the National Catholic Education Association. Catholic schools serve over two and a half million students a year. With an impressive average studentteacher ratio of 17 to 1. Catholic schools provide the necessary oneonone teaching that students need to learn. My graduating class of Holy Family had 23 students who graduated with me! I was able to bond with my classmates and had a true sense of family and support. My experiences with Sister Mary Catherine. Sister Mary Ambrose. Sister Mary Mathilda. Sister Jean Bernadette. Father Nathaniel. Father Carl. and Father Alvin instilled in me and the other girls at Holy Family an appreciation for Math and Science that was unprecedented at that time. The same quality education that I enjoyed as a youth is making a difference in communities across the United States. including my 37th District of California. I am proud of the four Catholic schools in my district that have created rigorous educational environments with quality teaching: St. Miguel Catholic School in Los Angeles. California. Verbum Dei High School in Watts. California. St. Albert the Great Catholic School in Compton. California. Our Lady of Victory Grade School in Compton. California and St. Philomena Grade School in Carson. California. These schools make a tremendous contribution to the community and I am proud to represent them in Congress.

Catholic schools are one of the cornerstones of our educational system providing faith based educational opportunities to those families who desire their children to have a Catholic faith based education.

Catholic schools across the country have contributed greatly to the communities in which they exist and the nation at large. Numerous studies show that parents place their children in Catholic schools for the superior academic achievement of Catholic school students. They 1996 tests of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) sponsored by the U.S. government demonstrated that students in Catholic schools score higher than those in public schools.

Last week over 8.200 Catholic elementary and secondary schools nationwide celebrated their 27th annual Catholic Schools Week. This event was established to increase support for private Catholic schools and to recognize their accomplishments and contributions to the country. \"Catholic Schools Week\" celebrates education that goes beyond preparation for a secular life. it is an education that prepares students for a Christian life. Parents who chose to send their children to Catholic Schools do so because they not only want their children to have an excellent education in reading. writing and arithmetic. they also want them to have a Christian education. Although public schools can prepare children for a secular life through a good education. they are constitutionally bound not to extend their role as educators into the area of religious education. I strongly urge parents who would like the benefits of public education and the rewards of faith based education to make a commitment to work with those religious communities that share their beliefs in the development of after school and weekend parochial programs. This bill states that Congress supports the goals of Catholic Schools Week. an event sponsored by the National Catholic Education Association and the U.S. Catholic Conference. and congratulates Catholic schools. students. parents. and teachers for their contributions to education. Catholic schools teach a diverse group of students. 24 percent of whom are minorities. Moreover. only three percent of Catholic high school drop out of school and 83 percent go on to attend college. Finally. the resolution states that. by providing an intellectually stimulating environment rich in moral guidance. Catholic schools produce students and. ultimately. citizens who are strongly dedicated to their faith and communities. I offer my heart felt thanks to the Catholic Schools across the nation for their dedication to excellence in the classroom as they prepare young people to achieve excellence in life.

Ronald Reagan. I want to share with my colleagues just a couple of thoughts because my colleague has been kind enough to take this time. I will never forget. while a member of the State Legislature. one day listening to television as I heard for the first time Ronald Reagan giving a speech for then candidate for President Barry Goldwater. And I rolled over and said to my family. \"By golly. he ought to run for governor of California.\" And by golly. not very far after that. he did run and was successfully elected. During that period of time. it was my privilege to work very closely with the governor. And people should know this about Ronald Reagan. two items I would mention. The first is it was my privilege to work with him on what is now known as the Child Development Act of 1972. It was the first quality preschool daycare act in the country and now serves as a model for the country. a Ronald Reagansigned bill in 1972. And 25 years later the Federal Government discovered it might be an issue. Another item: In the southland in my district in California. air quality is by far the most serious challenge we faced in the last 20 or 30 years. It was Ronald Reagan who signed model language developing a regional district that has developed the toughest clean air standards in the entire country. leading the country. Above and beyond that. let me say that the gentleman is correct at pointing to this great man as President of the United States.",

The people of my congressional district in Southern California are overburdened by the noise. pollution and traffic congestion generated by Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Airport expansion would only exacerbate these problems. That is why I am introducing the Careful Airport Planning for Southern California Act (the CAP Act). The CAP Act would cap LAX air traffic at its current capacity of 78 million passengers per year. The CAP Act would encourage airport development in Southern California communities that are eager for the benefits of a local airport. The CAP Act would ensure that the benefits and burdens of airport development are fairly distributed throughout the Southern California region. I urge my colleagues to support the CAP Act. to oppose the National Aviation Capacity Expansion Act and oppose the expansion of Chicago OHare and LAX.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 3479. the National Aviation Capacity Expansion Act. This legislation will codify a historic agreement reached between the Republican Governor of Illinois and the Mayor of Chicago to expand and modernize OHare International airport. As you know. OHare airport is one of the busiest airports in this nation and the hub to hundreds of destinations across the globe. Therefore. making it the center of our national transportation system. Unfortunately. OHare is the third leading airport for congestion and delays. According to the FAA. OHares systematic flight delays and cancellations has a crippling affect on our nations aviation system. Many of us. and the flying public. have spent countless hours sitting on a runway or in an airport waiting for a flight to taxi or depart. In 2000. it was estimated that OHare airport had 545 delays. or 63.3 delays per 1.000 operations. The principal reason attributed for these delays rests solely on the fact that OHare airport has antiquated runways. Hence. expanding OHares runways is essential in remedying our nations aviation crisis. It is estimated that modernizing OHare airport will reduce air traffic delays by 79 percent and weather delays by 95 percent. I am glad to see that this bill includes a provision to develop a third Airport in Illinois. This airport. known as the Peotone Airport. will provide our nations air transportation system with the additional relief required to reduce airport congestion while creating thousands of construction and permanent jobs for the South Suburban region of the state. We need solutions to aviation delays and congestion. Lets end this 20 year old debate. Expanding OHare and constructing a third airport is the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this critical legislation.",

Chicago has a vast and growing transportation industry. Over the years Chicagos OHare International Airport has continued its growth. in traffic and demand. Presently. OHare ranks as the Nations first or second busiest airport with nearly 34.000.000 annual passengers traveling both domestically and internationally. Expanding OHare offers an array of benefits: from employment to economic growth. As Chicago continues to grow. OHare continues to experience the backlog of delays. According to the Airport Capacity Benchmark Report in 2001. OHare was the third most delayed airport. Sitting in the heart of the Mid West. these delays continue to burden connecting airports creating a snowball affect and frustrated passengers. By the addition of runways. and the expansion of OHare delay times will diminish and air travel at Chicagos bustling OHare will undoubtedly improve for the consumer and the region.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have to say until I saw this latest information about the level of funding that was going to United Seniors Association and how much money they were spending on this ad campaign. I still was under the belief that some of our Republican colleagues did not like the Democratic proposal and liked the private insurance option because ideologically they did not like Medicare. they thought Medicare was not a good program. they did not like government. and they had a hard time supporting a government program like Medicare. even if it works. because it is a government program. But I am becoming more cynical now as I see the level of funding that is being spent on these ad campaigns and how it is just targeting Republicans. and particularly Republicans that are vulnerable. If we talk about a $100 million ad campaign divided over some of the most seriously contested seats. it will be almost as much money as some of the candidates will spend on their own campaigns. I think the support on the other side is linked to the money. is linked to the fact that PhRMA and the drug companies are putting all this money out to promote Republican campaigns. I am so glad that the gentleman raised the value issue. That is what this is about. This is about some greedy people who want to make more profit and do not care about the consequences for the average senior. Last week. last Thursday I believe. there was a bus load of about 50 seniors that came from New Jersey. They did not go to Canada. they were highlighting that they were taking a bus to come to Washington instead of Canada. The gentleman from Maine knows about all of the people that go over to Canada because of the cheaper drug prices. We had 15 buses that went the week before to Canada from all of the border States. All the seniors from New Jersey were talking about was the price. how the price of prescription drugs keeps going up. and it is so unaffordable to them. I do not understand how these brandname drug companies can spend $100 million on ad campaigns which are going to do nothing more than prevent these senior citizens from getting the medicine that they need. It is pathetic. It really is.",

If we do some of the other things. like the gentleman has addressed the issue of price. not just in the context of a senior benefit. but we have collectively talked about doing more with generics. like the other body passed the bill last week that would plug up the loopholes and make it easier to move to generics. E 2115 We have talked about this: I know that in the other body. one of the Members has a bill which I have sponsored here that would eliminate the tax underwriting of advertising for pharmaceuticals. I mean. those are the kinds of things that would make a lot more people. even those who are not seniors. able to buy drugs. Even generics. a lot of the brandname companies own a lot of the generic companies too. so it is not like there is this huge division between generics and brand names. A lot of the brandname companies manufacture generics too. So why is it that they do not see the increased volume that would come with that with many more Americans purchasing the drugs. even at a reduced price. as basically lifting their sales and their profits as well?

That is a 75 percent discount: $61 and $62 drugs on average. all of them for $15 a month. How can they do that? Well. they will sell more medication. They will sell more drugs.

Because if we look at all of the pharmaceutical industry drug discount card plans. they are out there advertising their discounts at being between 25 and 40 percent. That is what we have been talking about with my legislation and with other bills. getting to a 25 to 40 percent discount for all seniors. The pharmaceutical industry is out there saying. we have discount cards that will do that. we have discount prices that will do that. Now. the question is. if they are willing to do that. what is the problem with the legislation that requires them to do that? Well. the answer is. we do not want to be hemmed in. We do not want to be required. We do not want the government to be able to tell us what to charge. In fact. a promise that is made on a temporary basis to say. we are going to promise you 25 to 40 percent does not mean they can actually deliver that or will deliver it. They will. in all likelihood. do what they have done with all of their other markets. which is charge what the market will bear. and if they give a little bit of a discount today. they may take it away tomorrow. Seniors need predictability and continuity and stability in their Medicare plan. They need to know what the benefits are. they need to know what the premiums are for whatever services they are getting. If it is a physician service or if it is. as we have proposed. a prescription drug benefit on top of that. they need to have predictability. The pharmaceutical industry is not willing to provide it voluntarily. That is why we need legislation. so that seniors can sleep at night knowing that they are going to be able to take the medication that their doctors tell them they have to take. That ultimately is the goal. because ultimately. lifesaving prescription drugs should not be dispensed on the basis of seniors income. They ought to be dispensed on the basis that everyone who needs the medication will be able to get it. everyone should be able to have to pay some portion of the cost. but people who need lifesaving drugs ought to be able to get them.",

They were Republicans and Democrats. This is an issue that cuts across parties. It cuts across economic levels. as well. because people can be fairly welltodo and be unable to see that their parents or their relatives or their neighbors. their elderly neighbors. have access to lifesaving medications. People are sick of this. They are absolutely outraged at what is happening. Why that outrage does not result in some meaningful action here in the House of Representatives is beyond me. This problem has been with us for quite some time. We talk and we talk. and we have campaigns. and we say we are going to do something about it. yet time passes. and then we go through that kind of farcical exercise that we went through in our committee. where every amendment that we brought up that was designed to make these drugs more affordable was shot down by our Republican friends. They simply would not take the first step in trying to lower the cost of these drugs. They use all kinds of rhetoric. They talk about price controls. Well. I think when a pharmaceutical company charges a large HMO a certain amount for a medication and then charges some elderly. sick. incomelimited senior citizen two or three times as much for that same medication.

One of the problems is that. of course. if we are going to have cars that run on hydrogen. and in fact where the byproduct is not carbon dioxide. carbon monoxide. or whatever. but water. where you could get to zero emissions quickly. we do not have a lot of hydrogen filling stations around this country or in Europe.

And certainly that has been the response coming out of the West. and I think out of my colleagues State of Maine as well. The frustration that I have experienced in my political life has been that without leadership we do not get commitment of research dollars. of essentially those key dollars or those lending programs through international banks. Attention was brought to me by a constituent who actually worked out the technology with a lot of firms. none of which were American companies. on how we could reduce all oil dependence on all the islands around the world. All of the islands do not produce oil. so they have to ship it in. It is very costly. Yet they are surrounded by two things. they are surrounded by sun and they are surrounded by saltwater. If we could use the sun to convert the saltwater. one. we get fresh water for the island. which. in addition. could be used for mariculture. so we could start growing fish products onshore that would have global markets as well as a domestic market. and. two. we reduce the independence of having to ship this oil. Hawaii is a good example in our country. And we have a byproduct of clean water and an energy source. That is very expensive to do. and the first time it is done. it is not cost effective. There is no profit. There needs to be a risk. and usually those kinds of risks are taken by government loans and subsidies. but we have to get it started. I wonder if there was any discussion in Johannesburg about how to get the money in place to do some of these absolutely essential things.",

There was a fascinating meeting which discussed the devastating impact that the more advanced countries agricultural policies have on poor countries. All three of us had deep reservations about the agriculture bill that passed on this floor and was signed into law by the President just a couple of months ago. But the European Union. for example. is ignoring its own egregious agricultural practices. which are actually worse than ours. For instance. poor countries in Africa were denied access to the European sugar market where prices are kept artificially high. some three times the world price. to deal with the sugar beet industry in Europe. Poor countries cannot have access to that market. and the Europeans are producing so much that they are dumping that sugar on the world market. undercutting the poor sugar farmers in Africa. much like corn from the United States is going to Mexico and driving poor farmers out of business in Mexico. And our farmers are getting rich subsidies from our government. It costs them more to produce than they get from the market. and the surplus is dumped overseas. Yet we have aggressive policies to try to force some of the poor countries to open their markets to protect intellectual property I understand. to protect capital I understand. to protect drug patents. and sometimes it is less understandable why we do not do more to protect poor countries. and yet we hammer them with our inconsistent. and I would be prepared to argue. improper agricultural policies that are bad for the taxpayer. bad for the environment. and bad for most farmers and end up devastating poor farmers around the world.",

My amendment passed by voice vote. During that debate. I joined several of my colleagues in emphasizing the critical need to improve math and science education in our nations elementary and secondary schools. U.S. students consistently score lower than their counterparts in other nations in math and science. yet more than one in four high school math teachers and nearly one in five high school science teachers lack even a minor in their main teaching field. The training and preparation of math and science teachers must be a top priority. I am disappointed that the LaborHHSEducation Appropriations bill funds the math and science partnerships at just $12.5 million in fiscal year 2002- a level far below the $450 million authorized by Congress for this program in the final ESEA legislation.

Ms. Lindsay Stewart of Windber and Mr. Alexander Gates of Palmyra have just been named State Honorees in The 2001 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program. This program honors one high school student and one middlelevel student in each state for outstanding acts of volunteerism. They were selected from nearly 23.000 who were considered for this years program. Ms. Stewart was nominated by Forest Hills High School where she is a senior. for her creation of the \"Humanitarian Club.\" This club is dedicated to providing information about chemical brain disorders. and promoting tolerance of understanding of individuals who suffer from them. Inspired by an aunt afflicted with schizophrenia. Lindsay wanted to educate others about mental illnesses. During the past three years of her program. more than 300 people have experienced and learned from Lindsays Humanitarian Club programs. Mr. Gates is an eighth grader at Palmyra Area Middle School. where he led an effort to erect a monument commemorating Palmyraarea veterans who were killed in wartime military service. Alexanders design included a sixfoot obelisk inspired by his grandfather. who is a World War II veteran. He raised $8.250 to build the monument by selling granite bricks that would be inscribed with contributors names and placed around the base of the memorial. Alexander included an inscription on the obelisk that reads. \"This monument honors the spirit of selfsacrifice which is necessary for the survival of a community. It honors those members of the community who paid the ultimate price so we can live in a free and just country.\" I enthusiastically applaud Ms. Stewart and Mr. Gates for their initiative in seeking to make our communities better places to live. and for the positive impact they have had on the lives of others. It is at times like these. when I am given the opportunity to see the young people of our great nation make such a substantial difference. that I am so proud to be an American. Lindsay and Alexander have displayed great maturity. leadership. and most importantly. patriotism. With young people like them growing as leaders in our communities. we can be assured that the future of the United States is very bright. 0",

Corman. an esteemed Member of the House of Representatives from California for 20 years. Jim Corman was born in Kansas. and moved to California with his mother shortly after his fathers death. He served in the Marines during World War II. After the war. Jim worked his way through the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Southern California Law School. He first held public office in 1957. when he was elected to the Los Angeles City Council. Jim was first elected to the House in 1960. In 1963. he began serving on the Judiciary Committee. which he felt handled the issues that were among the most important and relevant to Americans. As a member of the Judiciary Committee. he was an influential voice in drafting and passing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964. Jim always considered this as the greatest accomplishment of his life. In 1968. Jim became a member of the Ways and Means Committee. where he devoted his energy to Social Security. tax. and welfare reform. He became a crusader for the welfare of senior citizens and the disadvantaged members of our society. Recognizing that his constituents would have better access to federal services if there were a federal building In the San Fernando Valley. Jim was responsible for securing funds for its construction. It is only fitting that this building be named after the man who considered constituent service to be one of his top priorities. Mr. President. James C. Corman was a wellrespected Member of the House. I am pleased to honor his memory by introducing a bill to designate the federal building in Van Nuys as the James C.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Support to Absentee Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Voters Act of 2001. This bill ensures that Americans serving overseas. be they the men and women of the military who stand guard on foreign shares. or equally deserving citizens who serve our country in other venues. will have their vote counted. American citizens should not loose their right to vote under arbitrary or unfair standards. It is therefore incumbent upon lawmakers to ensure their rights are protected. Although overseas mail is technically supposed to carry a postmark. the reality of the situation is that circumstances in foreign countries. or at sea aboard u.S. Navy ships. can result in mail being sent without a postmark. Currently several states require a postmark for an absentee ballot to be counted and without such a postmark citizens are denied their vote through absolutely no fault of their own. We saw the damaging affects of this standard in our most recent Presidential election. My bill provides that states may not refuse to count a ballot submitted in an election for a Federal office by an absentee uniformed services member or overseas citizen voter on the grounds that the ballot was improperly or fraudulently cast \"unless the State finds clear and convincing evidence\" of fraud in the preparation or casting of the ballot by the voter. Specifically. the bill states under a \"Clear and Convincing Evidence\" standard. the lack of a witness signature. address. postmark. or other identifying information may not be considered clear and convincing evidence of fraud. absent any other information or evidence. Consequently the mere absence of a postmark will not disqualify an overseas citizen from casting his or her vote. Mr. President. our most recent election illustrates the clear need for change in our voting procedures. Reform is needed. By making certain that Americans stationed overseas will have their votes counted. this bill is one crucial step in that direction. There is need for more reform however and I am working on a comprehensive election reform bill targeting abusive practices at home. I look forward to introducing that legislation next week and working with my colleagues towards adoption of all these measures. By Mr. HARKIN (for himself. Mr.",

Congressional recognition of the annual celebration of music. art. dance and theatre programs in American schools. There is growing awareness that arts education can help ensure Americas arts traditions and lead to higher I.Q.s. better SAT scores. better math and language skills. less juvenile delinquency. and improve chances of higher education and as well as increased job opportunities. According to a study by the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. students involved in the arts outscored students who were not exposed to arts on standardized tests. Among 10th graders. for example. 47.5 percent of lowartsinvolved students scored in the top half of standardized tests while 65.7 percent of highartsinvolved students scored above the test median. The study also found that students who consistently act in plays and musicals. join drama clubs or taking acting lessons showed gains in reading proficiency. selfconcept and motivation. By the 12th grade. those consistently involved with instrumental music scored significantly higher on math tests. The findings held true for students regardless of parents income. occupation or level of education. researchers said. I hope that by designating March as Arts Education Month. more schools and communities will engage in activities that showcase. celebrate. reward and provide new arts experiences for students of all ages.

The Girl Scouts emphasize that their mission is to help all girls grow strong. They emphasize that Girl scouting is available to every girl in every community. reaching beyond racial. ethnic. socioeconomic and geographic boundaries.

Elizabeth selflessly gave her time and energy to her community through her intense love of all living creatures. and was a woman of unquestioned integrity and of unparalleled morality. She will be sorely missed by each and every person whose life she touched. and as her family mourns her loss. I believe it is appropriate to remember Elizabeth and pay tribute to her for her incredible contributions to her city. and her state. Elizabeth and her husband John first came to Colorados San Luis Valley in 1995 after riding on the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad. They decided to make the beautiful valley their home. and immediately embarked upon a mission to make it a better place for all to live--even the animals. After arriving in the San Luis Valley. Elizabeth served as the President of the Humane League. dedicating her time to organizing fundraisers for spay and neuter clinics and finding homes for stray cats and dogs. She had a strong conviction that the best way to help the plight of animals in the community was to control the population by spaying and neutering. Her efforts were critical in procuring funds from the Max Fund to assist with lowcost spay/neuter clinics in the community. In addition. she loved the outdoors. and had climbed most of Colorados highest peaks. inspiring her husband to take up the sport as well. Elizabeths extraordinary selflessness and dedication to all living things will be sorely missed by everyone that knew",

My amendment would reduce the size of the tax cut and place the savings into a reserve fund for Social Security reform. Medicare reform. and a prescription drug benefit. This amendment would retain those tax cuts included in the bill that would benefit lower and middleincome taxpayers. such as the creation of a 10percent bracket. expansion of the child credit. marriage penalty relief. pension reform. education tax incentives. and alternative minimum tax relief. This amendment would also retain the estate tax relief provided in the bill through an increased exemption credit. But the amendment would strike from the bill the marginal rate reductions and the estate and gift tax repeal. both of which would only benefit the wealthiest taxpayers in the Nation. so that those funds can be redirected into Social Security and Medicare reform. Unlike the underlying bill. this amendment would help to ensure that Social Security and Medicare benefits are available for future retirees. while still providing a substantial tax cut that would be more evenly distributed amongst the American taxpayers.

On the last page of this amendment. the Senator attempts to offset its cost by delegating to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to adjust tax rates.

Further. the amendment allows the unelected Secretary of the Treasury to raise the new 10percent rate on lowincome taxpayers to 12 percent or 15 percent or the Secretary could raise the 28percent bracket on middleincome families to 29 percent or 30 percent. The Secretary of the Treasury has no constitutional authority to set tax rates. That is what we were elected to do.

The Milwaukee Clubs commitment to raise over $60.000 for the Worldwide Service Project insured that 1.5 million individuals will not suffer from disorders including stillbirths and cretinism. This gift will also allow future generations to grow up healthy and confident that their children will reach their full physical and mental potential free of IDD. The Kiwanis Club of Milwaukee also actively reaches out a hand to help its fellow neighbors. By working with Milwaukee Public Schools and YMCA Holton Youth Center. the Milwaukee Club has made an commitment to improve the lives of numerous youth by volunteering their time to tutor in an inner city Milwaukee school and by providing mentors. organizing book drives. and donating computers to Holton Youth Centers library to help the young participants to continually achieve success in their own lives. Dedicated to expanding the horizons of all citizens. the Kiwanis Club of Milwaukee. along with Curative Care Network of Milwaukee. worked to form the fifth Aktion Club in the world. This innovative program gives developmentally handicapped adults the opportunity to actively provide community service throughout their neighborhood. This year the Milwaukee Kiwanis Club and Aktion Club are joining together in the annual Milwaukee River Cleanup and the holiday seasons bellringing campaign. Through their contributions and service projects. the Kiwanis Club of Milwaukee has established itself as an important resource for thousands of individuals. It is with great pleasure that I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Kiwanis Club of Milwaukee as they commemorate this milestone. and extend best wishes for continued success in their next 85 years.",

She has had the bracelet for over thirty years. she bought it to show her support of our armed forces. and promised never to take it off unless her POW was released. These bracelets were a method of putting public pressure on the Vietnamese government to send our soldiers home. It worked.

West Virginia. I am proud to represent them in Congress as part of the Third Congressional District of West Virginia. Don Carson. the Director of IUOEs Hazmat program. and a team of workers from the Beaver facility were among the first outofstate workers to be sent to work at Ground Zero immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks. Mr. Carson has sent me heartwrenching pictures of the twisted metal that show the depth of the tragedy and the danger of the rescue work. But that danger has not deterred any of the workers who have been involved in the rescue. and now recovery. effort. Ever since the tragedy occurred. IUOE. and the Hazmat Center. have played a major role in the rescue and recovery effort. In fact. Mr. Carson has been coordinating the Hazmat workers activities based out of a command post trailer parked on the right field warning track of a baseball field near Stuyvesant High School. Today. Mr. Carson sent me an article from the New York Daily News. The article describes how Mr. Carson \"has been handing out respirators. hardhats and protective vests since the attacks.\" The workers health has come into question as the long weeks pass since the attacks. They have developed a cough that doctors refer to as the \"World Trade Center cough.\" Don Carson and IUOEs Hazmat Center are trying to tackle this. They are working with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York City Department of Health (DOH) to conduct a respirator fit test and orientation for all workers assigned to Ground Zero. The workers must have a DOH sticker affixed to the credentials in order to work in the Red Zone. After the workers take their respirator fit test. they will be given an American flag hard hat. The News article notes that these workers \"battle constant danger. fumes and fatigue. as well as their own emotions. \"Our guys have seen things that God never intended.\" said Bobby Gray. 46. the unions master mechanic. \"But they soldier through.\"",

Eight weeks have passed since the attacks on the World Trade Center. and we still do not have a sound airline security bill. How much longer do we have to wait? We have heard numerous reports of passengers with knives and guns passing security checkpoints supervised by the companies that Republicans want to keep overseeing our security. These private companies only interest is profit. not national security. Current baggage screeners are poorly paid. lack at times proper training and suffer from high turnover rates. Federalization means less employee turnover. more experience and better wages. Those who protect our skies should be treated with the respect that their job demands. That respect means higher wages. more training and better qualified individuals. All of these objectives can be achieved by federalization of the airline security. Federalization means universal standards. We need a sound airport security bill that would give the government the responsibility of overseeing safety.

This new school partnership represents an important step for integrating all children into a single education system. Matsunaga Elementary and Longview School. is named in honor of Senator Spark Masayuki Matsunaga from Hawaii. He was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1962. and later served in the Senate from 19771990. Matsunaga Elementary is the first school in Montgomery County named after an AsianAmerican. The school is the first colocated school in Montgomery County and represents an end of separating students with special needs from their peers. The colocation of these schools creates a true community for the students and enhances their learning experience. The children benefit from their interaction by sharing special times in which students read to each other. Also. students celebrate special events together such as Dr. Seuss Day and the Olympics. To commemorate the colocation of these schools. students raised $2.100 for a time capsule that will be displayed at the schools Media Center. In addition. students and their families have contributed written works and letters that will be included in the capsule. The capsule will be opened in twenty years when its countdown clock reaches zero. The success of Matsunaga Elementary and Longview School is due to the hard work of faculty. parents. staff. and students that give hundreds of hours to make the education experience enjoyable. Principal Judy Brubaker and Coordinator Louis Berlin are fortunate to lead this new school into the 21st century. with its new architecture and technology that will enhance the learning environment.

With the current war in Afghanistan. our televisions have been flooded with images of individuals who struggle daily to meet their nutritional needs. Malnutrition seems to be a problem that only affects those half a world away. Unfortunately. the war on hunger is also battled in the United States every day. On May 11th. letter carriers from across the Nation will join together to collect nonperishable food items from their customers that will then be sorted and delivered to local food pantries for distribution. Last year. letter carriers in the metropolitan Milwaukee area. with the help of the Hunger Task Force. collected over 763.000 pounds of food to insure that the over 40.000 moms. dads. and children that go to local pantries for nutritious food did not go hungry. These donations come at a critical time when supplies at pantries are traditionally low and demand for food to feed schoolage children typically peaks. as access is restricted to school breakfast and lunch programs. Currently. 42 percent of low income children nationally depend on school programs to provide both breakfast and lunch. As the food drive takes place right before the local schools go on summer break. the timing of this event makes the National Association of Letter Carriers Food Drive extremely important to the health of the most needy in our Nation.

This exceptional stateoftheart school facility houses a general education elementary school. Spark Matsunaga Elementary. and special education school for children with disabilities. Longview School. It is appropriate that this new school honors the memory of a truly remarkable man and former colleagueSenator Spark Matsunaga. Over the course of a lifetime of service to the people of Hawaii and America. Spark exhibited fortitude. courage. and persistence in fighting for what was right and what was best. As noted by Dr. Jerry Weast. superintendent of Montgomery County Public Schools. this is the first public school in the nation named in honor of an Asian American. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta. Representative CONNIE MORELLA. Hawaii State Senator Matt Matsunaga. and Keene Matsunaga were a few of the speakers who spoke of Senator Matsunagas distinguished life and career. A childrens chorus entertained and sang- the school song. The \"Home of the Geckos.\" Matsunaga Elementary has made a wonderful start with dedicated teachers and administrators and a diverse and involved community of students and parents. Spark Matsunagas commitment to justice and lifetime of service to America merits this singular recognition. Throughout his career. Sparky worked to ensure that all Americans enjoyed the fruits of liberty and understood our shared responsibilities for keeping our country free and strong. Spark Matsunagas legacy of public service. espousal of the art of peacemaking. and commitment to justice is a wonderful example for the students and staff that proudly work and learn at Matsunaga Elementary School. I know that Helene Matsunaga and the Matsunaga family are deeply appreciative of this unprecedented tribute. and the people of Hawaii take pride in Montgomery County bestowing this honor on Senator Matsunaga and his service to our great Nation. Madam. President. I ask that a copy of the commemorative biography of Spark Matsunaga distributed at the dedication be printed in the RECORD. The biography folllows:",

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 19. 1993 in Seattle. WA. A man attacked two lesbian women. pushing one through a window. The assailant. Terrance Donato Scott. was charged with a hate crime in connection with the incident. I believe that governments first duty is to defend its citizens. to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law. we can change hearts and minds as well..",

At the time H.R. 4680 was being considered. that is the bill we had last session that had the drugonly policies. it said. At the time H.R. 4680 was being considered. the insurance industry. acting through the Health Insurance Association of America. made clear that it had no intention. no intention. of offering drugonly policies. The health insurance industry reasoned that drugonly insurance policies would be subject to adverse risk selection: that is. they would disproportionately attract consumers who have existing health conditions. are sick or disabled. and are among the oldest of the old. As a result the policies would be very expensive and would have very few takers among healthier Medicare beneficiaries. The failure to attract beneficiaries with low drug costs would further drive up premium prices and lead to an increasingly unaffordable price spiral.

I will say. where we are talking about free markets being able to set the price. And what has happened here in this country. the great shame that has taken place here in this country is that the profitability or the profits garnered in this industry have been done almost exclusively on the backs of the elderly and those who can least afford to pay it. And why do we know this and why have we asserted that it is a free market approach? Because every survey. every study that has been done. whether it be internally in our own country. whether it be in Mexico. in Canada. whether it be in the United Kingdom. Australia. Japan. or Germany. what we found consistently is that their citizens are able to enjoy. on average. a 40 percent differential in terms of what they pay. not for generics but for the exact same prescription drugs. Shame on us. And that is why I think people in this body. if we are allowed an opportunity to vote. and I cannot even believe as an American that I am standing here on the floor of Congress and saying if we are allowed the opportunity to vote.

I am hoping. and I am trying not to be so cynical. but the gentleman does point out that there is a real possibility that the Republicans may not even allow us to bring up our proposal and have a vote on it. I hope that is not true. But the best thing. or one of the most important things about the Democratic proposal is that because we are putting this program under Medicare. now the Secretary who administers Medicare. the Health and Human Services Secretary. now will have these 30 or 40 million seniors that fall under Medicare. We have a mandate in the Democratic bill that he has to negotiate prices down. and he will have the power to do so because he has the 30 or 40 million seniors in Medicare that he now represents. I have no doubt that that will lead to a price reduction of maybe 30 percent because of his negotiating power. The Republicans have nothing like that in there. The only thing President Bush has talked about is the drug discount cards. which are essentially a farce because they are already available. The cards are available. I am not saying the cards are a farce. but for him to suggest that somehow the Federal Government would lend its name to it is meaningless. The cards are out there. You can buy them any day. Most seniors are aware of them. They do provide some discount. but the Federal Government is not doing anything. I guess the only thing President Bush is saying is just promote the cards. go out and buy one. which I think is meaningless. If we do not control price in some meaningful way. whatever plan we pass here will not work because seniors are not going to be able to afford it in the long run.",

And then the combination of those two things. both being in the Medicare program and having the ability to negotiate down. will be extraordinarily helpful. I think also. in the process. and I was on the floor earlier talking about the need for research and development in aeronautics. we also have to recognize the continued commitment on the part of this country to invest in research and development in these related fields. And I think that that is so essential to our future. We know how productive the field has been. I hail from the State of Connecticut. home of a number of pharmaceutical companies and the insurance industry. New Jersey has been a longstanding State that has been influential in terms of some of the major breakthroughs that we have had in pharmacology.

Those programs would continue in the State. The State would then get money to pay for those programs. I do not know how Connecticut works. but most States are not as generous as New Jersey. And this applies to any Medicare beneficiary. In New Jersey it is a little over $20.000 per year income that you are able to tap into the casinofunded prescription drugs program. But remember. this is not incomebased. because Medicare is not incomebased. So if you are making $25.000 a year or $30.000 or even $100.000 a year. you would still be able to take advantage of this benefit by paying your $25 a month premium. and you pay 20 percent. and the Federal Government pays 80 percent. Frankly. I think that is important because most of the people that contact us are the people not getting what the States are offering. In other words. a lot of States have no benefit. Some States like New Jersey and Connecticut have some benefit. but most seniors in New Jersey are still not getting any kind of meaningful coverage through the State program because it is very expensive for the State. We are doing something now that will click in for every Medicare beneficiary. We have part A. which is the hospital bills: part B is the doctor bills: part C is HMOs: and part D would be the new prescription drug program.

But I want to bring into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD remembrances of the American Legion as a young boy growing up in central Pennsylvania. Most of the parades and most of the patriotic functions of that era were either sponsored by or joined in by the American Legion. but that was not all. They also sponsored teenage baseball organizational sports. they also sponsored essay and oratorical contests in the high schools. and in a variety of ways went beyond their chief function of honoring the veteran. because they were part of the actual life of the community in so many different ways. Then the other portion of the American Legion that sticks hard to my memory is that during the time I served in the Armed Forces myself. there were two refuges for us in the various bases in which we served. and in particular. I remember in Fort Knox. Kentucky. the USO was always there on the weekends for the purpose of providing extra services and relaxation for the veterans who were serving or the members of the Armed Forces who were serving at Fort Knox. and also the American Legion always had some kind of hostmanshiptype of function to welcome the soldiers who were stationed at Fort Knox.

This legislation amends the charter of the American Legion to revise eligibility for the organization to those individuals who have served honorably in the Armed Forces during or after specific periods. Presently. service members are only eligible if they have served during specific periods. including designated windows for World War I. World War II. Korea. Vietnam. Lebanon/Grenada. Panama. and Desert Storm. Because the window governing Desert Storm has not closed. under current law. Desert Storm veterans are not eligible to join the American Legion. This measure corrects this problem. The American Legion was founded and chartered by Congress in 1919. Its first major accomplishment was the creation of the U.S. Veterans Bureau. which was the precursor to the Veterans Administration. Significant accomplishments of the Legion include the enactment of the G.I. bill. and the establishment of the cabinetlevel department of Veterans Affairs. The Legion also led the fight for an investigation into the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam. the investigations into gulfwar illnesses among Desert Storm veterans. and for the constitutional amendment to prohibit physical desecration of the American flag. Like its fellow veterans service organizations. the American Legion offers valuable service to its membership. including. but not limited to: seeking discharge upgrades. record corrections. education benefits. disability compensation matters and pension eligibility. The Legion also has a long and distinguished history of community service. Given our current war on terrorism. I believe it is appropriate for Congress to recognize. expand and promote the efforts of our veterans service organizations. For this reason. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

In the following decades. veterans from Korea and Vietnam were permitted to join through charter modifications made by Congress. Like its fellow veterans service organizations. AMVETS offers valuable services to its membership. including. but not limited to: seeking discharge upgrades. record corrections. education benefits. disability compensation matters and pension eligibility. AMVETS also has a long and distinguished history of community service. Given our current war on terrorism. I believe it is appropriate for Congress to recognize. expand and promote the efforts of our veterans service organizations. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3214. a bill I introduced to amend the Federal charter for the AMVETS organization. The bill makes a number of simple changes to the organizations current charter. which was first approved in 1947. First. my bill changes the meaning of AMVETS from American Veterans of World War II. Korea and Vietnam to American veterans. AMVETS was founded on December 10. 1944. in Kansas City. Missouri. It was born out of the desire for WWII veterans to have their own organization. Overtime. AMVETS charter has been amended to allow veterans from following wars to join the organization. In 1984. the charter was amended to allow anyone who served honorably after 1940 to join the veterans group. As a result. its current name does not encompass this broader membership. H.R. 3214 would correct this discrepancy and allow the organizations name to more adequately reflect its current membership. This name change was also approved by the organizations members at their 1998 annual convention. In 1961. AMVETS modified the structure of its governing body. However. its current charter still reflects its old organizational structure. Therefore. H.R. 3214 also revises the organizations Federal charter to reflect the new composition of AMVETS governing body. Finally. since the approval of the original charter. the organization has relocated their headquarters from the District of Columbia to Lanham. Maryland. H.R. 3214 amends the original AMVETS charter to provide for its headquarters and principal place of business to be in Maryland rather than the District of Columbia. I want to thank Chairman SENSENBRENNER. Subcommittee Chairman GEKAS. full Committee Ranking Member CONYERS and Subcommittee Ranking member SHEILA JACKSONLEE for their assistance in moving this legislation. H.R. 3214 is noncontroversial and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.",

The language would allow veterans from conflict areas such as Somalia or Kosovo to be eligible for membership in the VFW. Currently. VFW membership is limited to those who have honorably served in the Armed Forces and who have received a campaign medal for service or those who served honorably for a specific period on the Korean peninsula. F] 1445 Without this amendment. members of the Armed Forces who served under equally dangerous conditions. such as those experienced in the campaign medal service in Korea. are not eligible for VFW membership. The bill also adds the word \"charitable\" to the purpose of the VFW. VFW members volunteer millions of hours to local communities. Although volunteerism has always been a large part of the mission of the VFW. in some States the VFW is being denied qualification as a charitable organization because \"charitable\" is not included in their charter language. These amendments reflect the language of two resolutions approved by the voting delegates of the VFW at their national convention in Milwaukee. Wisconsin. I urge the House to pass this bill to ratify the changes to the VFW Federal charter. which have been approved by the membership. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker. this time I rise to pose some reflections on the VFW. Many people will recall historically that during the Truman years there was an act of terrorism right in this Chamber. when terrorists of a different era shot up the entire Chamber here. wounding several people. One of the Members of the House at that time was the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Jimmy Van Zandt from Altoona. Pennsylvania. who helped to apprehend one of the terrorists with a gallant leap into the back portion of the balcony. and brought him or helped bring him to justice. But more than that. this Jimmy Van Zandt was also. prior to that. national commander of the VFW. He holds a place of honor in that organization for his special efforts and for his service directly to the country. Then there was Dominique DeFrancesco. also from central Pennsylvania. served as national commander of the American Legion when. in 1991. he joined then President Bush in the 50year commemorations at Pearl Harbor. These are the kinds of devoted veteran citizens who are in the background of what we do here today when we enlarge the membership potential of their organizations. But the most important portion of the VFW. as far as I am concerned. is because the last 30 years or more I have participated as a judge in the VFWs annual Voice of Democracy contest. Here is a contest of radiospoken essays by our high school students who speak on what America means to them. or some other subject matter having to do with patriotism. In this way. the VFW spreads the notion of loyalty to our Nation. service to our communities. and patriotism. For that. I salute the VFW and urge everyone to support the legislation that is in front of us.",

With that in mind. Mr. Speaker. I think as member of the Subcommittee on Immigration. Border Security. and Claims of the Committee on the Judiciary. I hope that the Congress will move swiftly to pass 245(i) that will allow immigrants to access legalization and become citizens. This is long overdue. This is legislation that recognizes that we do not equate immigration to terrorism. and it is as patriotic as the legislation that we have just passed today. So I hope that the Congress will move quickly on this legislation. and I rise again to support the legislation before us and ask my colleagues to support this legislation as we honor the men and women who have served us in the United States military and now our veterans. and as we honor those. as well. who serve us every day fighting for our freedoms.

Both of these changes were requested by the delegates to the last VFW annual convention that was held in August of last year in my hometown of Milwaukee. Wisconsin. The best way we can help our veterans. I think. is by not confusing the issue. Let us help our veterans by doing what they asked us to do. which is to allow them to expand their membership. as well as to get some State departments of revenue off their back claiming that what the VFW does is not charitable in nature.

I add only in his memory the one thing we might concentrate on doing is concentrating more on research and develop to improve efficiencies. Through smart public policy we can reduce energy consumption by improving the energy standards and efficiency standards required of common appliances like air conditioners as well as refrigerators. photo copiers and fax machines. I think that would be a great testament to Mr. Carriers life and his hard work. If we just applied those standards already on the books in this country. we would be estimated to save consumers some $150 billion in energy costs by 2020. In fact. if we really looked at our research and development monies. we will know and realize that they have decreased from $6.55 billion in 1978 to some $2 billion now in 1998. In 1998 the Presidents Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology recommended that our research and development costs over 5 years be increased because right now they are not commensurate in scope or scale with the energy challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and those that they will present. Again. I also add our voice to the congratulations of Dr. Carrier.

This bill authorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology to promote best practice standards and facilitate understanding between industry and government. Approximately 90 percent of U.S. manufacturing companies are small and mediumsized businesses. Quick and easy access to information in the supply chain is critical for small businesses to be competitive. Suppliers without the capability to collect and exchange data electronically run the risk of being replaced by other suppliers who can. The last decade has seen a dramatic shift in the way information and data are exchanged. This is due to the emergence of the Internet and the movement toward electronically integrated supply chains. Enterprise integration permits a group of manufacturers and suppliers to operate as a single virtual company. without time delays and data loss or corruption. Manufacturers must be flexible. efficient. and responsive to changes in customer preference. NIST will work with industry and small business to improve the way they share product and standard information. With over 20 years of experience in data integration. NIST has the experience to accelerate efforts to develop industry standards and integration techniques that are necessary to increase efficiency and lower costs. Connecting enterprise together will streamline the manufacturing process. break down communication barriers. improve knowledge sharing. and connect information systems. In my home State of Michigan. small businesses are vital to the State economy. Over 45 percent of Michigan small businesses are in the manufacturing sector and enterprise integration is extremely important to ensure that the manufacturing industry in Michigan and around the Nation remain strong. The investment in enterprise integration is essential for U.S. industry to remain competitive with overseas companies. many of which are already heavily investing in electronic standards development. I thank the gentleman from Michigan for developing this important legislation and the gentleman from Michigan of the Committee on Science for bringing this to the floor.

After hearing of the challenges she has faced and still faces today in order to try and live a normal life. I introduced the Reconstructive Surgery Act of 2002. H.R. 4959. This bill requires health insurance plans to cover medically necessary reconstructive surgery for congenital defects. developmental abnormalities. infection. trauma or disease. As an infant. Wendelyn Osborne was diagnosed with a rare. congenital bone disease. craniometaphysial dysplasia. or CMD. which involves an overgrowth of facial bone that never deteriorates. At the time of her diagnosis. she was the sixteenth CMD case in the world in medical history. Doctors told her parents that she would not live past the age of 10. After many surgeries. starting at the age of 6. Wendelyn has lived to be 36 years old. But she is not free of the harmful effects of her disease. Her facial muscles are paralyzed. Her optic nerve is damaged. and she must wear a hearing aid in order to hear properly. The severity of her abnormalities requires further orthognathic surgeries so she may continue to be able to eat properly. Yet. Mrs. Osbornes insurance company will not cover this procedure because it is considered cosmetic. Mr. Speaker.

This is an important addition to the bill and the authors. the Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. are to be congratulated on the development of this amendment. Regulatory and antitrust laws serve different functions. This amendment recognizes and embraces that fact as it preserves the antitrust laws and it indicates that these laws are not affected by H.R. 1542. the Telecommunications Act of 1996. nor the Communications Act of 1934. Second. and equally important. is the fact that it does not overrule nor affect any court case interpreting those laws including the Goldwasser case. The savings clause preserves this case law as well. Third. when the savings clause uses the term antitrust laws. such term includes antitrust defenses and immunities. Congress and the courts have recognized how illequipped antitrust courts are to serve as regulatory agencies. Thats why the 1996 Act replaced judicial supervision under the AT&T consent decree with regulatory supervision of the process through which competition in the telecom industry would be jumpstarted. If we had simply abolished the AT&T consent decree and left all these details to antitrust enforcement agencies. private litigants. and the courts. five bad results would have occurred. First. the courts would have been flooded with regulatory tasks they are not suited to handle. It was a formidable task having one federal judge trying to micromanage the telecommunications industry under a consent decree. We did not repeat that experiment by authorizing many state and federal antitrust courts to undertake the same tasks. Second. the antitrust enforcement agencies. including the Department of Justice. would have been called on to duplicate. second guess. and perhaps contradict the telecommunications policy decisions Congress instead decided to entrust to the FCC and to the state commissions. We need the enforcement agencies to enforce the antitrust laws. not establish telecommunications policy or duplicate the regulatory expertise of other agencies.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on the first of this year. a 5.4 percent acrosstheboard Medicare payment cut went into effect for doctors caring for seniors. Under the present payment system. further deep cuts are in store for the future. In some areas of the country doctors are no longer accepting new Medicare patients because payments no longer fairly recognize the changing health care needs of todays seniors nor the increasingly complex and difficult environment doctors must work under. With malpractice insurance skyrocketing. nursing costs rising. diagnostic and treatment options expanding rapidly. and paperwork burdens exploding. these cuts are unjustifiable and unfair! They result from an arbitrary formula that ignores the real costs of providing health care. According to the American Medical Association. Medicare payments to doctors have increased only 18.5 percent in the last 10 years. an average of 1.1 percent per year. which pales in comparison to the skyrocketing costs of providing health care. To now cut payment rates 5 percent for four years will. without question. force early retirements among physicians who are primarily serving our seniors. or force physicians to limit the number of Medicare patients they serve. More seriously. in the long run underreimbursing our doctors in yet another public health care program will discourage the top quality students medicine has traditionally attracted and erode the world famous quality of American medicine. Today. I am introducing legislation that would implement the recommendations of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and reform Medicares doctor payment formula. The bill repeals the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system that has resulted in unpredictable payment increases and cuts. If left in place. the present SGR system is projected to cut physician payments by more than 20 percent over the next several years. My bill increases payments to physicians by 2.5 percent in 2003 and ties future updates to an index similar to the Medicare Economic Index. making the system for adjusting physician payments similar to that for adjusting Medicare payments to other providers. While much work remains to be done to understand and manage the cost of this commonsense reform. rational payment rates are essential to maintaining the quality of Medicare. I am committed to providing physicians with a more stable. predictable. and fair payment formula. Absent such reform. we will shortchange our physicians and threaten both access to care and quality of care for our seniors.",

There has been a lot of discussion in the past two weeks about sadness and anger. and most of that discussion was about the attacks of September 11th. Today. there is yet another reason to be both sad and angry. Today. this House is departing from its partisan truce and healing rhetoric of unity. Today. the war will have to wait. while we strip gays and lesbians of legal benefits and once again thwart democracy right here in Washington. DC. There are 113 jurisdictions nationwide that have domestic partner benefits and Congress has taken no action to block any of these benefits provided to other Americans. The fact that some Members of Congress seek to do so today is insulting. outrageous. and. quite frankly. offensive. The House Appropriations Committee acted in a bipartisan manner to allow DC to offer its residents domestic partner benefits. and now the House leadership has authorized the violation of House Rules in order to undo the work of the Committee on this issue. Domestic partner benefits allow residents to visit loved ones in hospitals and long term care facilities. officially register as partners. and. for employees of the District of Columbia government. to purchase health insurance at their own expense for their partner. This is hardly revolutionary or even uncommon in our nation today. Over 4.200 employers around the country. including hundreds of cities. colleges. and universities. have already established domestic partnership health programs. In fact. this amendment is not only meanspirited and unwarranted. it is also bad health care policy. At a time when millions of Americans lack any health insurance. why would we stand in the way of any extension of health care benefits? Do we as a Congress really want to tell D.C. residents. they should be denied health care simply because of whom they love? This amendment is a disgrace and should be defeated.",

As you are aware. the Defense Production Act gives the President important emergency powers to ensure that industry produces needed material during times of military or civil emergencies. Unfortunately. with the events of September 11. we find ourselves in the midst of both. The Presidents authority under the DPA expires on Sunday. and it is important that we renew these powers during this critical period in our Nations history. The House passed a clean 3year reauthorization on September 5. The Senate returned the bill to us late Friday night. limiting the Presidents authority to only one year. With the clock ticking. we dont want to be back in this same position next year. Therefore. in the best spirit of compromise. we are amending the Senate bill and splitting the differenceextending the DPA for 2 years. I know that some of my colleagues in the other body have some concerns about the powers granted to the President under the DPA. and particularly in how they have been used in the past. They have my assurance that we will look closely at those concerns in the interim. and make changes where they are necessary. I want to thank Chairman KING. and ranking members LAFALCE and MALONEY for their help in moving this bipartisan legislation forward. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and this amendment.",

Clearly. this body would have preferred a 3year extension of the Act. as reflected in the earlier legislation already passed in the House. However. it is also clear that a 2year extension is the most prudent course of action in order to ensure that reauthorization of the Act is signed into law within the next few days. As I have argued repeatedly during the past two weeks. the Act contains Presidential powers that may well be needed to be called upon in the aftermath of the terrorist attack. In fact. we already have indications that the DPA will be invoked in the coming weeks. One news report from this morning states. \"[The DPA] is one of an array of statutes likely to be used frequently in the coming weeks as DOD seeks to expedite procurements--especially in the information technology and telecommunications sectors.\" With todays action in this body. I am confident that we will have an extension of the DPA signed into law prior to its expiration on September 30. and I want to thank my colleagues again for demonstrating the wisdom and flexibility that has been necessary to make that happen.",

The subcommittee considered and marked up the legislation on June 26. forwarded it to the full committee by unanimous consent. and the committee considered and marked up H.R. 2199 on July 25 and ordered it to be reported.

Metropolitan Police Department in order to assist the Metropolitan Police Department with local law enforcement in the District. The original 1997 legislation provided great assistance to the District of Columbia by enabling Federal law enforcement agencies to enforce local laws on or near their jurisdictional boundaries. The 1997 legislation specified certain law enforcement agencies. inadvertently leaving out some agencies. H.R. 2199 cures this restriction by allowing other law enforcement agencies to enter into cooperative agreements with the Metropolitan Police Department if the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department and the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia deem it appropriate.

As the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. they have worked long and hard on legislation that is critically important to the future of health care for our citizens that rely on Medicare. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 3018. and I urge all of our colleagues to support its passage as soon as possible. In the closing days of the 107th Congress. there will be many bills that on their way to consideration and passage will enjoy the unanimous consent of the Senators. There are few of these many bills more worthy of our consideration and unanimous consent than this measure. Vermont. like so many of our States. has a healthcare system that is facing reductions in levels of Medicare reimbursement that are untenable. In some cases. these reductions took effect on October 1 and others will occur at the end of this month. The cuts have already led to fewer physicians and services being available to care for our elders. The list of cuts and reductions is long. Physicians and other healthcare professionals. home health agencies. critical access hospitals. skilled nursing facilities. sole community hospitals. and others are being affected. And make no mistake. these cuts translate as cuts in access to healthcare for our elders. But it is not too late. We can pass this legislation. engage in a conference with our colleagues in the other chamber. and have a bill for the President to sign before the end of this Congress. Once again. I want to commend Senator BAUCUS and Senator GRASSLEY for their work on this bill and for this chance to speak to its merits today. It is needed legislation. it is balanced. and it is well crafted. Our elders need it passed. Our providers need it passed. Children depending on SCHIP need it passed. and our States need it passed.

Mr. Chairman. the great failure of September 11 was our failure to methodically analyze and share among our Federal and local authorities critical intelligence information. The task before Congress today is to provide greater transparency in the informationsharing process so that police officers. sheriffs. elected officials and other emergency responders can exchange vital information while also protecting the critical sources and methods that are used in gathering such information. The bill before us today. the Homeland Security Information Sharing Act. answers this calling. Specifically. it directs the President to develop procedures by which Federal and local agencies and personnel share security information. It ensures adequate security in the dissemination and transmission of classified or unclassified information based on a recipients need to know. It protects the legal and constitutional rights of individuals by requiring that shared information is current. factually accurate. and used only for the authorized purpose for which it was obtained or disseminated. Finally. it safely and responsibly provides authorized State and local officials access to certain types of sensitive information. including foreign intelligence and grand jury information. consistent with the Justice Department and CIA agency guidelines. Mr. Chairman. transparency must be the goal of any homeland security proposal. This legislation fulfills our responsibility to the American people by providing authorized professionals with the best. safest. and most accurate information available in the most efficient manner possible.",

The discretion will still remain with the Federal entity that possesses the information. This bill as amended and reported out of the Committee on the Judiciary focuses on procedures to strip out classified information so that State and local officials may receive the information without clearances. The bill also removes the barriers for State and local officials that prevent them from sharing intelligence information with Federal officials. The September 11 terrorist attacks made it clear that the Federal Government must improve its ability to collect. share and analyze information. The USA PATRIOT Act and this bill address that pressing need. Mr. Chairman. America must have a comprehensive information exchange system that will allow those on the front line. our State and local officials. to detect and prevent a terrorist attack.

I rise not only as a cosponsor of this bill and also supporter of the bill but also to urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation as we vote on it today in this body. There has been a growing theme. Mr. Chairman. that Congress must take this opportunity to address the lack of information sharing among some of our Federal agencies. As a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. I have heard testimony about how some of these agencies do not share information in a way that best protects our homeland. To put it another way. not all of the dots are being connected. Internally. some agencies. like the FBI. may connect some of the dots. the CIA may connect some of the dots. and the Border Patrol and Customs may connect some of the dots. But if all of our efforts fail to present a complete picture. we are likely to face a tragedy perhaps worse than those we faced on The current stovepipe barriers that prevent timely information sharing must stop. Never before in our Nations history has communication sharing among our national security agencies been as imperative nor as important as it is today. While information sharing horizontally must improve. our local law enforcement and first responders demand that we achieve vertical integration in information sharing as well. As we have all heard from our constituents back home. the first responders are the people who play key rolls in protecting the communities in which they serve. Our police. firefighters. medical personnel must be informed of the threats that exist within their communities so they are able to prepare and protect those in their communities. H.R. 4598 ensures that information sharing. both horizontally and vertically. exists by directing the President to develop procedures by which Federal agencies will share security information with State and local personnel. Further. it ensures that informationsharing systems have the capability to transmit classified and unclassified information. Mr. Chairman.

We know first hand in Portland.

I think this legislation which I am cosponsoring directing the administration to develop procedures for Federal agencies to share this information. both declassified and classified. is appropriate with State and local authorities. This bill requires the CIA and the Department of Justice to prescribe procedures in accordance with Presidential directives with Federal agencies to share homeland security information with State and local authorities. These Federal agencies would also be required to provide to State and local authorities an assessment of the credibility of such information. This legislation is going to go a long way to further enhancing the relationship between the Federal. State and local governments so we can together protect Maine and the Nations homeland security.",

Much of this information will. by necessity. be sensitive. often derogatory information which will be circulated without the target of the information ever being able to respond. For public safety reasons. we have to be able to communicate what is known. but we need to make every effort to ensure that this information is circulated just to those who actually need it and not spread all over town so that the chances are increased that someones neighbors or friends who happen to work for the government agencies might see it unnecessarily. This bill. because of the hard work of those involved. strikes that appropriate balance. It is slightly different from the Senate version of the bill which tightens the language in regards to privacy and limitations on the kinds of information which will be subject to the provisions of the bill. I would hope that the conferees will adopt the Senate language. It is not inconsistent with the goals of the bill.

In the weeks and months after September 11. they have been tireless advocates for ensuring that barriers to information sharing between federal. state. and local officials be eliminated.

It is important to note. too. that the legislation is flexible. providing the President broad guidelines within which to design information sharing mechanisms. but leaving to him many of the mechanics of how best to do so. It also requires the President to report back to Congress in 1 year on whether additional changes are necessary.

I want to thank the leadership for bringing up legislation to address the need for sharing of critical homeland security information among federal intelligence agencies. state and local governments. and first responders. Through my work on the Intelligence Committee. I have collaborated with Representative CHAMBLISS and Representative HARMAN to make sure that all levels of government receive the same homeland security information so our local law enforcement agencies and first responders have the proper information to protect us. The attacks of September 11 obviously exposed some communication weaknesses among our intelligence and law enforcement agencies and now is the time to forward and analyze what went wrong. and more importantly how we can make changes to protect our country from future terrorist attacks. As a member of the Joint SenateHouse Intelligence Committee reviewing September 11. 1 am learning more about our overall intelligence apparatus in context of the September 11 attack and how we can improve the system. The most important goal is to find the best intelligence solutions to ensure our homeland is secure and all domestic agencies are coordinating. communicating. and cooperating with each other. H.R. 4598 directs that critical threat information be shared between federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies with state and local personnel. including granting security clearances to appropriate state and local personnel. I strongly support the Presidents proposal to reorganize our homeland security agencies and enhance information sharing. H.R. 4598 will immediately strengthen our homeland security apparatus while the new Department is being implemented by directing the President to develop procedures by which the federal agencies will share homeland security information with state and local personnel and ensures that information sharing systems have the capability to transmit classified or unclassified information.

Coordination and information sharing among federal. state and local authorities may be the single most important thing we can do to enhance our ability to respond to a terrorist threat. This point is reiterated to me in every meeting I have had with law enforcement personnel. firefighters. public health officials and state and municipal leaders in my district since September 11. We need communication. We need cooperation. We need coordinationnot only among federal agencies. but also with our people in the field. In my role on the Democratic Homeland Security Task Force. I have spoken with many first responders about their concerns. They say the same thing. The Federal Government simply does not pass information down the chain to the local level to the extent that is so necessary. And this fact can continue no longer. The Federal Government relies on state and local personnel to protect our Nation against a terrorist attack. We rely on them. It would be unconscionable if we didnt help them to do their job to the best of their ability. And the ability to do their job effectively relies on the information they receive. I think H.R. 4598. the Homeland Security Information Sharing Act. is an important step toward developing and ensuring an effective strategy for truly protecting the United States. We simply need to get information into the hands of those who need it. and this bill does that.

State and local personnel are the most likely individuals to interdict terroristsas demonstrated by the detainment of Ahmed Ressam on the Canadian border and the routine traffic stopping of one of the 9/11 terrorists by a Maryland state trooper. As we have learned in the last several weeks. if we had shared more information before the attacks. we may have been able to more aggressively intervene against the terrorist plot. The legislation will also help state and local officials prepare an appropriate response to future attacks. Every act of terrorism is localoccurring in a neighborhood. city or state near you or someone you know. Often times. officials at the state and local level are firstline responders to these attacks. The bill is not perfect. The more broadly information is shared. the greater the danger it will be improperly disclosed. I think we all agree that the last thing we would want is for the newly shared information to be used to harm an innocent persons reputation. As we move forward. we should take a close look at whether sufficient safeguards are in place that will prevent improper disclosure from happening. The bill. in its current form. offers us a good starting point to improve our nations defenses against terrorism.

This ceremony held by the Chaldean American Ladies of Charity will pay tribute to Chaldean American men and women who have served or are currently serving in our Nations military. It is particularly poignant that people are gathering to honor Chaldean American veterans on the day set aside to honor our foremost symbol of freedom: the American flag. At a time when we are reminded of the priceless value of our many freedoms. it is important that we do not forget the heroes who fought so fearlessly and valiantly in past conflicts to protect our nation and our freedoms. Such brave men and women have preserved our liberty and democratic values and safeguarded our freedom to pursue the American dream. The Chaldeans are people who possess a long and fascinating history. They have traditionally spoken a form of Aramaic. the language in which the New Testament was written. and possess an interesting theological history that includes a reunion with the Roman Catholic Church in 1551 A.D. This reunion led to the establishment of the Chaldean rite of the Catholic Church. Many Chaldeans immigrated to the United States from Iraq. and have played an important part in our nations growth and success. Detroit is privileged to be home to the largest Chaldean community in the United States. In Detroit and throughout the nation. Chaldean Americans have dedicated themselves to the making a better life in America. Detroit. the State of Michigan and our nation have benefitted from their patriotism. hard work and dedication to community. faith and family. These many contributions have greatly benefitted our nation and have included the service of nearly two hundred Chaldean Americans in the United States Armed Forces. The entire Chaldean American community can take pride in their long and honorable tradition of service to our nation. particularly their service in our nations armed forces. I am sure that my Senate colleagues join me and the Chaldean American Ladies of Charity in paying tribute to Chaldean American veterans.",

Kamehameha is a legendary. indeed. mythical figure renown worldwide for his bravery and martial brilliance. He commands the respect of Hawaiis people for his wise and just leadership. and his accomplishments continue to influence and govern Hawaii today. Historically. Kamehameha is notable because of his brilliance as a military strategist and political leader. Kamehameha adapted Western innovation. weaponry. and science to gain a decisive advantage in his drive to unify the Hawaiian Islands. For Native Hawaiians and the people of Hawaii. Kamehameha is beloved for his concern and attention to the wellbeing of his subjects and for his commitment to do what was just and right for the people. Kamehamehas wisdom. even more than his strength. stature. and daring. is his greatest and most enduring legacy for Hawaiis indigenous peoplesthe Native Hawaiians. the people of Hawaii. and all students of history. Mamalohoe. the Law of the Splintered Paddle. is the most prominent example of Kamehameha as a wise and just leader. Mamalahoe is Hawaiis first Bill of Rights protecting the common people from assault. and it is still part of our States constitution. One hundred and ninety years ago. in the summer of 1812. Kamehameha returned to the Kona Coast. Having unified the islands and established peace and stability. Kamehameha worked to build prosperity for his people by increasing agricultural production and foreign trade. The first observance of a day honoring King Kamehameha was proclaimed by King Kamehameha V on June 11. 1872. in the Kingdom of Hawaii. It remains an annual holiday in the State of Hawaii.

The point I would like to leave with Members today is that we are rapidly diminishing excuses for not opening up ANWR and recognizing that. indeed. the argument that previously prevailed that we can simply make this up on CAFE standards is clearly not in the interest of a majority of the Senate. primarily for the reason of safety associated with Americans. and children in particular. and the advantages of a heavier car moving our children around. As we look at alternatives. I remind my colleagues who are in objection to opening ANWR that they do bear responsibility for coming up with alternatives that are realistic. Certainly from our side. ANWR is realistic. And the probability of a major discovery is second to none from the standpoint of the geology of North America. I think I have said enough for today.

Senator THOMASs staff. various people who have been working very hard on that set of issues. My own view is. the bill was substantially weakened by the two votes we had related to CAFE standards in particular. Clearly. the Senate was not willing to step up and ensure any kind of significant increased efficiency in the transportation sector in the coming years. That. to me. is a disappointment. a weakening of the bill.

The Girl Scouts began on March 12. 1912. when founder Juliette Gordon Low assembled 18 girls in Savannah. GA. for the first ever Girl Scout meeting. She believed that all girls should be given the opportunity to develop physically. mentally. and spiritually. Girl Scouts of America has a current membership of more than three million girls and adults. 150.000 of whom live in Michigan. There are also more than 50 million Girl Scout alumnae throughout our nation. Girl Scouts serve their communities. developing skills in a diverse array of activities including sports. media relations. education and science while growing into the leaders of tomorrow. One of this years Young Women of Distinction is Ms. Noorain Khan from Grand Rapids. MI. To earn this distinction she worked on many projects including one with the Islamic Center of Grand Rapids which serves a community of 13.000 Muslims. She helped develop a grant proposal for a program to educate Muslim youth about their religion and culture. and better equip them to make responsible decisions as adults. Her grant proposal consisted of a preliminary curriculum outline. data on demographics in the Islamic community and a job description for a program director. Though the grant has not yet been secured. a framework now exists for the Islamic center and for future grant proposals. All Girl Scout programs are based on the Girl Scout Promise and Law and Four Program Goals: developing selfpotential. relating to others. developing values and contributing to society. To achieve these goals. they have established programs in foster homes. homeless shelters. school yards and Native American reservations. Further. the Girl Scouts of America have established a research institute. received government funding to address violence prevention and are addressing the digital divide with activities that encourage girls to pursue careers in science. math and technology. Today. 90 years later. the organization offers girls of all races. ages. ethnicities. socioeconomic backgrounds and abilities the chance to develop the reallife skills theyll need as adults.

Milton is located on Milton Three Ponds. an area blessed with an abundance of waterpower which was utilized by different industries including several sawmills and a woolen mill. Miltonia Mills which specialized in fine wool blankets that were used by Admiral Peary on exploratory exhibitions. A distillery and five icehouses which supplied ice to Boston. Massachusetts. were also located in Milton. Construction of homes began in Milton during the early 1800s and the first rural schools. Plummers Ridge School #1 and Nute Ridge School #2 were built. Both school buildings remain standing in Milton today. In 1853. Lewis Worster Nute. a native of Milton. provided financial support in his will to build a school and a library in Milton and a chapel in West Milton. Today. the Town of Milton. situated in southeastern New Hampshire. has a population of approximately four thousand residents. Teneriffe Mountain overlooks Milton Three Ponds which connects to the Salmon Falls River. offering spectacular scenery year round.

These are people who are more than just in this for a business. These are people for whom family farming is their life. It is all they know. It is what they do. It is what they want to do. There is .so much value in family farming in a country. Farmers produce much more than just wheat or corn or soybeans. They produce communities. They produce cultural value. It is a seed bed for family values that moves from family farm to small towns to big cities. It is such an enormous contribution to the country. That is why. as I mentioned. in Europe they decided long ago that the kind of economy they want is an economy that has healthy family farm agriculturea network of producers living on the land throughout Europe producing their food. We should make a similar commitment and write a farm bill that does that. In the meantime. this emergency supplemental is the bridge to get from here to there. I do hope beyond this afternoon we are not further delayed by anyone stalling with what clearly is an emergency piece of legislation designed to reach the extended hand out to say to family farmers that we are here to help during tough times.",

And it is important that we do something in this emergency supplemental bill. We were asked by the Chair to withhold. Another bill was brought by the House of Representatives. the Export Administration Act. which has passed the House. All they did was continue the bill that is now in existence. which is also a disaster for the hightech industry. The Senator knows that the hightech industry has a number of things they need to remain competitive. One is to make sure we pass legislation that modernizes the ability of these hightech companies to export things that are now sold in Radio Shack that. under present law. they cant do. I want my friend to comment on what he sees happening here in the Senate. I reflect back to last year. when we were in the minority. we passed by the August recess eight appropriations bills. We have now passed three because. as you know. they have been slowwalking the Transportation appropriations bill. and we hope we are fortunate enough to get the VAHUD bill. We must do something on this emergency bill that we are now trying to get before the Senate on agriculture. We also need to do the Export Administration Act. I think my friend will agree that it will allow the hightech industry to stop exporting jobs overseas and do them here so they can manufacture equipment here. sell it overseas. and not have to move their businesses overseas to manufacture equipment over there. But we are not going to be able to do that. it appears. It looks as if the House is satisfied with extending the act that is already in existence. which the industry says doesnt do us any good at all. Will my friend comment on what is happening in the Senate with these things?",

The Budget Committee allows the Agriculture Committee to spend up to $7.35 billion in fiscal year 2002. which begins on October 1. There are no instructions in the Budget Committee that say we cannot meet until after that to decide how to spend that $7.35 billion. There is no reaching forward. There is no moving money from one fiscal year to another. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania. This committee recognized that fiscal years and cropyears do not coincide. So what the committee did. because of the press of business. what is happening this fall. since we dont know when the next farm bill is going to be done. and in accordance with the budget resolution. was to obligate $2 billion of the $7.35 billion for next year to be spent in 2002. So the money is coming out of the $7.35 billion for fiscal year 2002. It is not being forward funded. There is no moving money from one fiscal year to the other.

It said they opposed the bill that we have before us because spending authorized by the bill would exceed $5.5 billion. the amount provided in the budget resolution and the amount adopted by the House. It is the amount adopted by the House. but it is not the amount provided in the budget resolution. The budget resolution provided two amounts: $5.5 billion this year and $7.35 billion next year. We stayed within the $5.5 billion for this year. Then we had $7.35 billion for next year. The administration is saying we cant spend what the budget resolution provides. The administration has nothing to do with this. This is something that is internal to the Congress. If we are meeting our budget obligations. why should the administration care? Evidently. the administration must be opposed to how we are spending the money. How are we spending the money? In the next fiscal year we are spending money on a lot of our specialty crops such as apples. I mentioned in my earlier talk about how our apple farmers are being hurt. We heard that the livestock sector is rebounding. But that doesnt mean the crop sector is rebounding. Far from it. We have specialty crops in peas and lentils. I mentioned apples. We have a lot of other specialty crops that are in dire need of assistance all over this country. This bill is much fairer region to region than the House bill. The House bill focused on a few crops but not on the entire country. That is why I do not understand the administrations objection to this. They say the bill provides funding for a number of programs that have nothing to do with farmers 2001 incomes. It sure as heck does.

One establishes a scientific research unit in USDA. It provides additional funding for business and industry. It provides that U.S. cities with populations not exceeding 50.000 will be eligible for guaranteed community facility costs. That has nothing to do with emergency farm income this year. This is just another vehicle to try to do some more agricultural authorization. I am not against doing agricultural authorization. I loved being on the Agriculture Committee. But we should do it in a farm bill and not in an emergency supplemental bill for agriculture. No. 2. the fact is. I think the Senator has received letters from the White House and previous administrations where they said: Senior advisers will recommend that the President veto the bill.

George Yeardley. called into session a meeting of twentytwo citizens called burgesses. from each of the eleven boroughs subdivisions. of colonial Virginia. According to one of the participants. Mr. John Pory. \"all the Burgesses took their places . . . till a prayer was said by Mr. Burke. the minister.\" who asked God to \"guide and sanctify\" the proceedings to his own glory.\" The Speaker then addressed the members of the assembly on their duties as participants. \"Our intent.\" wrote Mr. Pory. was \"to establish one equal and uniforme kinde of government over all Virginia.\" Thus began. 382 years ago this very day. the first representative. legislative body in American history. the Virginia House of Burgesses. I do find it ironic that today. when there is so much talk about separation of church and state. that the very first legislative assembly in American history took place in a church. It seems very fitting that the legislative foundations of the worlds greatest power. and the worlds foremost proponent of liberty and. I might add. religious freedom began in a church. What a momentous day July 30. 1619 was. not only in American history. but also in world history. Right there in that little church in Jamestown. VA. a colony still struggling to survive. a colony that had been decimated by plagues. disease. hunger. and war. a significant step was taken in the development of representative government. Think about it. even with all the problems of simply staying alive. these men. driven by that eternal desire to be free and to rule themselves. to be free of the control of kings. emperors. czars. and other autocrats. had the intellect and the foresight to meet in that church and begin a journey that would eventually lead to the establishment of our republic. Independence was still more than 150 years away. but the seeds of American democratic thought had been sown. It is probably no coincidence that from the House of Burgesses would come some of the most important champions of American liberty and greatest leaders of the American Revolution. including Thomas Jefferson. George Washington. John Marshall. and Patrick Henry. For this reason. I want to recognize this very important. if overlooked. day in our American heritage.",

These fourteen extraordinary students were recently honored with the Congressional Gold Award. a prestigious award given to a very select group of dedicated young people from throughout the Nation. The Congressional Award program was established by Congress in 1979 to recognize the initiative. achievement. and service of extraordinary young people from across the Nation. The Award was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter. and each president since Carter has renewed the authorizing legislation. To qualify for the Congressional Gold Award. an individual aged 14 to 23 must complete at least 800 hours of goaloriented work in four program areas: Volunteer Public Service. Personal Development. Physical Fitness. and Expedition/Exploration. These program areas emphasize each persons capacity to grow and develop as an individual. as well as how each person can selflessly contribute to the happiness and wellbeing of their community. South Dakota Congressional Gold Award recipients chose to volunteer their time and talents in many different areas. where they made tremendous contributions. One recipient volunteered at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Ft. Meade. SD. Some awardees became mentors or Girl Scout leaders. while others volunteered at childcare centers. athletic associations. local schools. parks. and even in the South Dakota State Penitentiary. One individual actually established an annual volksmarch in their hometown. For their outstanding commitment to physical fitness. personal development. exploration. and for committing their hearts and hands to volunteering in their communities. I would like to congratulate the following young South Dakotans for receiving the Congressional Gold Award: Kary Bullock of Ashton. Eric Davies of Whitewood. Nicole Hammer. Janelle Stahl. Kayla Stahl. and Michelle Jilek of Mellette. Ryun Haugaard and Norman Haugaard II of Milbank. Carrie Larson and Jessica Larson of Mitchell. Alexsis Malsam of Aberdeen. Andrea McComsey and Tracey Smith of Conde. and Betsy Valnes of Sioux Falls. I thank these outstanding young people for their immeasurable contributions to their communities. the State of South Dakota. and our Nation. It is because of individuals like these that I have great faith in the continued success and prosperity of our great Nation. These individuals truly serve as an example for all young Americans.9",

The amount of warming or if the planet is warming at all. and like the gentleman from Pennsylvania suggests. some scientists have even come to the conclusion that maybe we are in a coolingoff period. I think nowhere is this more evident than in the divergence between atmospheric conditions. the data collected from satellites and weather balloons. and surface temperature data collected from ships which tell a different story. Highly accurate satellite measurements do not note any warming over the past 2 decades. What we have in the red. for those individuals that can make out the small details. the red is the surface temperature. The blue is the satellitemeasured temperatures. and lower are the balloonmeasured temperatures. If you take the satellite along with the weather balloon temperatures. they are almost on an even keel. and they show no global warming. The only global warming that is portrayed is the surface temperatures. and they could be caused by a lot of changes. such as expanded populations in some of the areas. In terms of the potential contributions of ocean. you see a big peak over here in 1998. That was actually credited to the impact of El Nino.

The blue at the bottom indicates how much they sequester or capture of C02. And of course all living organisms live on C02. Our plants collect that as part of their growing. Because our agriculture is so intense and expansive in the United States and our forest lands are so abundant. we capture about the same amount of C02 as we emit. Unlike the European countries. as you see on the right. the tropics and the southern hemisphere capture more because of the forests and the growth of biological products in that area. We see a great sequestering. But the point needs to be made strongly that that has to be part of the consideration. And it has to be part of our research in the future. How do we increase our ability with technology to capture some of that C02 just in case it might be causing a greenhouse gas out there. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Research in the Committee on Science. and all of the scientists in the field on this issue agree that we need more research on global warming because there is so much that we do not know.

There was a huge influence from the White House and the Vice Presidents office. and there was intimidation at the university level that if you wanted grants and further studies. you better give them the message that they want. When you buy scientific information and you tell them what you want to be in the answer. you are not getting anything for your money because all you are getting is somebody to state what you want stated. Mr. Speaker. real science is about searching for the scientific facts. I think a lot of that was veered from in the last recent years.",

    "speech": "There is no question that making sense of climate variability is a hugely complex challenge. but one that we can make progress on. at least before we commit to onerous regulations. In a 1999 study. the National Research Council made recommendations for a research strategy focusing on unanswered scientific questions. The NRC identified over 200 questions that need answers if we are to understand and predict climate change. That is exactly what the gentleman from Pennsylvania is suggesting. we need real science and real answers to some of these questions. But in the meantime. there are things that we can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We can improve energy efficiency. and we are doing that. We are developing new energy sources. sources that do not emit C02. and certainly the research to expand the sequestration of C02 must be encouraged. I have one chart that I think is dramatic. This is a model by the UC National Center for Atmospheric Research. What this diagram shows. the red line is what is going to happen to global warming without the Kyoto treaty. The orange line that we see coming up slightly underneath it in the years 2040 to 2050. represents the possible reduction in temperature. And even if all of the Kyoto treaty was implemented. the reduction in climate is 0.07 degrees centigrade. almost unmeasurable in its extent. We still have scientists that came before me in my pursuit of what is the right answer suggesting that a little global warming might be good for agricultural expansion in this country. So with that small a degree in warming. I think it is very important that the Members of this Chamber. Madam Speaker. understand that we could go into grave consequences by the implementation of this. That is why I certainly want to encourage the negotiators on the conference committee that are taking up this State Department authorization bill to review this. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I put the last chart up to show some of the accomplishments that we have achieved in the last 3540 years especially in terms of increased energy efficiency. The top black line represents the energy use at constant 1972 GDP. How much GDP does one unit of energy achieve. What has happened is our actual energy use to achieve this greater GDP. which has almost doubled since 1979. is way down below what we have expected. That shows this country has been very aggressive in trying to achieve the greater economy. It takes 30 percent less energy to produce a dollar of GDP than it did in 1970. So we are moving ahead. That greater efficiency means less emissions. That greater efficiency means less energy use that is also compounding our problem right now. It is an appropriate time to discuss this issue of the Kyoto protocol when we are looking at high energy prices because if we were to follow that protocol and reduce our energy use back to the 1979 levels. we would have to ration the amount of home heating fuel and gasoline and coal. and the way to ration it would be dramatically increasing price or some kind of law that says you can use only so much. Either way. there is a dramatic implication on the economy of this country. and that means on the standard of living of this country. because what other companies are going to do if energy prices were to go up in the United States. they are going to look at these countries like China and Mexico and the other ones that were impacted by this protocol and look at the energy price there that is going to be much lower. and they will say. hey. we are going to move our business and our factories and our production to those other countries. Of course. when that happens and those other countries start developing. it is very unlikely that they are going to sign a similar protocol some time in the future to impede their economy. So I think it behooves us all to make sure that we think very carefully before we emotionally move ahead on something that might cause more damage than it does good.",

As a result of autism. an estimated 400.000 Amencans have lost the ability to communicate and interact with others. In my home state of Rhode Island. autism had become an absolute crisis. The incidence of the disorder has risen by over 1000% in the past seven years. and by over 300% in the past five years alone. Caring for people afflicted with autism costs more than $13 billion per year. and the majority of these costs are borne by the families of the victims of autism.

Yet. they still do not receive the support they deserve from the government. My nephew has a form of autism so I know firsthand the challenges these families face. Many days. my nephews parents cannot hold conversations with their son. Communicating with him takes extraordinary patience. Had his parents not engaged him in an intensive intervention program immediately after his diagnosis. he would have made much less progress today. It was not many years ago that children with autism would have been misdiagnosed and often institutionalized for the rest of their lives. Parents of autistic children regularly encounter people who do not understand the difficulties associated with autism. Friends and teachers become impatient. They repeat the same phrase over and over. as if the child will understand if it is repeated one more time. Teachers are often illequipped to deal with the special challenges of autistic children. H.

I want to join in this tribute to our friend GEORGE GEKAS. and my friend from Iowa just mentioned the fact that Mr. GEKAS regularly talked about the need for us to have an automatic continuing resolution. and it was the Committee on Rules that he came before on a regular basis. and I remember one time where on every single appropriations bill. he would come before the Committee on Rules making the case. So he was dogged in his pursuit of that just as he was in his pursuit of bringing about bankruptcy reform. and we all know that this process has been a very messy. difficult one. but it is exactly as James Madison envisaged it. and I think that he was looking down and saw GEORGE GEKAS work through this process over a long period of time. Mr. Speaker. I would also. when I think about GEORGE GEKAS. like to take a moment to mention another of our colleagues who is retiring. my very good friend from California. STEVE HORN. When I think of GEORGE GEKAS. I think of STEVE HORN. another welleducated work horse. Steve Horn is an individual who came to this institution with an amazing background. having been a college president. and he is someone who. because of his tremendous institutional memory having worked as an aid to former Senator Tom Kuchel of California. he brought an understanding of the work of the other body and an expertise which will be sorely missed. As I think back and I see my friend from Virginia here. I am reminded of the work that we did on the issue of Y2K. and he will recall that our colleague Mr. HORN began very early having a wide range of hearings focusing on the governmental challenge of dealing with the turn of the century and the Y2K issue. And I want to say that he and his wonderful wife Nini have worked night and day representing a very difficult and challenging area in southern California but at the same time understanding the responsibility that they have had in this institution. So I would just like to say. Mr. Speaker. that he will be sorely missed and I certainly wish him well in his retirement. And I thank my friend for yielding.",

I have known STEVE HORN I think longer than anyone in this body because I was a Senate page from 1963 to 1967 and STEVE HORN worked there as a legislative aid to Senator Tom Kuchel. When he left Senator Kuchels office. his replacement was a young man named Leon Paneta. So history works in strange ways. but I kept up with STEVE through the years. followed his career in the presidential administration he went into. leaving Tom Kuchel. and then into his academic career. Of course STEVE had degrees from Harvard and Stanford. was a university president. well regarded in the Long Beach community. When he was elected to Congress in 1992. it was a huge upset. This was a district that had been drawn to elect a Democrat. and STEVE won it and held it every time. the only Republican most years to be elected in that area because he transcended politics. He was a very detailoriented Member. He took copious notes on every hearing. what Members were saying. I hope some day he will publish that and share that with the world.

Crouch is a true leader and a winner both on and off the field. Despite playing through pain much of his career. Crouch never missed a snap in his final three seasons due to injury. Crouch. a native Nebraskan. has set a powerful example through his hard work and steadfast determination to overcome obstacles. He has matched a fierce will to win with humility and strong character. In addition to winning the Heisman Trophy. Crouch was also recently named the winner of the Walter Camp Award. given to the collegiate player of the year. and the Davey OBrien National Quarterback Award. given to the nations top college quarterback.

Since the September 11 terrorist and the subsequent anthrax attacks. we in this country have become acutely aware of our vulnerability to bioterrorism. and I particularly became a cosponsor of this legislation because of those concerns. One of my major concerns has been the unique vulnerability of medically underserved populations to a bioterrorist attack. Many of the residents of these areas do not have access to even basic health services. much less comprehensive health insurance or preventive and specialty care. In addition. state and local governments which provide many of the health services to these communities are finding their resources depleted due to the recent recession and terrorist attacks. This legislation goes a long way towards protecting medically underserved communities and strengthening state and local health departments. Specifically. I thank Chairman TAUZIN and Mr. DINGELL for agreeing to work with me to include a provision in this bill which investigates the unique needs of medically underserved areas in case of a bloterrorist attack. Also. the bill strengthens state and local public health infrastructure through a series of grants. which include funding for: the purchases or upgrades of equipment. supplies. pharmaceuticals or other countermeasures. the training and education of health care professionals where there are shortages. and laboratory services and poison centers.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of H.R. 3030. the Basic Pilot Extension Act of 2001. which passed the House by voice vote on December 11. 2001. The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot conducted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) in my home state of Nebraska. among others. This pilot. which started in November 1997. involves verification checks of the SSA and the INS databases of all newly hired employees regardless of citizenship. Unfortunately. the Basic Pilot program was scheduled to terminate on November 30 of this year. The agricultural economy of Nebraskas Third District relies heavily on immigrant labor. For the most part. I believe that employers across my district want to comply with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. which made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ aliens not eligible to work. and required employers to verify documents of new workers. However. a simple visual check of these documents by employers will not tell them if these are in fact counterfeit documents. and that this potential new hire is in fact an illegal alien. I have heard from many business people in the Third District about their need for the Basic Pilot program. Employers need the appropriate tools to ensure that they are indeed hiring eligible workers. By checking the new hires documents against the INS and SSA databases. the Basic Pilot program allows employers to feel more confident about their new hire. H.R. 3030 will extend the Basic Pilot program for employers in Nebraska for two years. I thank my colleague. Representative LATHAM. for introducing this much needed extension. and I am pleased it passed the House on December 11. 2001.",

In the process. many parents have struggled to find the right way to tell their young children about the horrific nature of the terrorist attacks on our nation. Indeed. the events of September 11 brought to the fore unsettling questions about the problem of human evil and hatred. As parents have sought to instill patriotism in their childrentelling them about the decent values that America represents and the civilized traditions our nation carries onit seems that some teachers are sending young students the \"Blame America First\" message. Chester E. Finn Jr.. president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation. a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. and a former assistant secretary of education. has observed that the curricular guidance coming from state and local education leaders suggests that the United States brought the September 11 attack on itselfthrough its \"imperial\" foreign policy and \"ignorance\" of other cultures. Nothing could be further from the truth. this is not the kind of overly politicized message students should be hearing. Id like to commend Mr. Finn for exposing this activity. Id also like to commend former Education Secretary William Bennett for developing an alternative to this kind of antiAmericanism. Mr. Bennetts education firm K12 has creating an instructional resource for parents and teachers to use in teaching children about patriotism.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my appreciation and admiration for the students of Lewis and Clark College. which is in my district and is my alma mater. Frustrated with the leadership of this country. these forwardlooking students have decided to take the matter of climate change into their hands. In order to fight global warming. the students have voted to raise their annual student fees by $10 per student per year. In fact. in a voter turnout thats twice what we see for special elections for local governments. 83.3 percent of the students voted yes. The fee increase will raise enough money to make Lewis and Clark College compliant with the Kyoto treaty through the purchase of \"offsets\" from the Climate Trust. a nonprofit organization. The offset projects that the new fee would support include a webbased commuter matching system that will reduce car traffic in Portland. investments in landfill gas recovery system. and helping to preserve forests on Native American lands in the Northwest. Studies at Lewis and Clark College have shown that increased parking fees. better transit. and a higher number of students living on campus have had a positive effect on the colleges green house gas emissions. In this way. the college is far ahead of the rest of the country in realizing what we need to do to reduce our contribution to global warming. The United States is the single largest generator of greenhouse gases. contributing one quarter of the global total. Although the colleges emissions are minimal. the students actions are significant. Lewis and Clark is the first of what will be many colleges across the country developing a climate strategy. It is the collection of these individual actions that will make a difference and eventually shape our nations policy. One can only hope that when President Bush presents the Administrations proposal on global warming tomorrow. it will include tough mandatory green house gas reductions.",

It was a very difficult time period for her. and for our family. I am pleased to report that she is in good health today. And I can still celebrate this holiday with her. Unfortunately. not many women are as lucky as my wife. Heart disease is the number one killer of American women. In fact. cardiovascular diseases kill more females each year than the next 9 causes of death combined. The seriousness of this disease doesnt stop there. Heart disease is our nations number one killer and leading cause of longterm disability. We need to raise awareness to fight this disease. Preventive health care is the key to lowering the number of victims of heart disease. Risk factors of heart disease are high cholesterol. high blood pressure. tobacco. lack of activity. and obesity. The majority of these risks can be prevented. And we can only accomplish this through education to raise awareness. February is American Heart month.

He will be discussing issues ranging from the war on terrorism to improving trade relations between our two nations. I view this trip as an important and positive part of the ongoing U.S.-China dialogue. However. I believe it is imperative that we do not ignore the suffering of the working class in China. I recently read an article in the Washington Post about the Shuangfeng Textile Factory located in Dafeng. China. According to the Washington Post. corruption has engulfed the firm. leaving thousands of workers with little pay and little hope. Top executives of the firm have forced workers to buy over priced company stock and to accept pay cuts of up to 50%. which amounts to $25 to $40 a month. Reportedly. resistance to those demands has resulted in some employees losing their jobs. The workers attempted to acquire the attention of local and federal officials by signing petitions and staging strikes. They sat in the factory for days and nights. not even returning home to see their loved ones. During those nights. police stormed into the factory and used force to drag them outside. The police also made dozens of arrests to try and put an end to the employee uprising. In spite of all this. the government apparently took no action to investigate the case. Eventually. the workers were defeated and had to accept the terms of management and return to their jobs with broken spirits. I hope all of my colleagues take the time to read the portion of the Washington Post article that I have submitted for the RECORD. Instances. such as the one at the Shuangfeng Textile Factory. are cause for great concern. People in China are crying out for justice and they must not be ignored. I urge President Bush to raise this issue with the leadership of China and work with them to help improve the situation. More over. the President should press China to improve its labor. environment. and human rights record in general. It is important for us to take advantage of our dialogue with China to help put an end to the suffering of so many people. [From the Washington Post. Jan. 21. 2002]",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in strong support of the JohnsonHagelReedEnzi Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act of 2002. SFDIA. and I urge my colleagues to support it. I am proud to be one of the authors of this legislation. as I believe it will continue to ensure a strong and safe insurance system for our banks. and most importantly for the consumers that put their trust in that system. The legislation before us also seeks to end the procyclical method now in force. which tends to burden institutions in bad economic times. and not prepare for the future during good economic times. We need to change that. and I think this bill begins to finally address this important issue in a very thoughtful manner. The bill that my colleagues and I have introduced has five major components. The first element addresses the most noncontroversial aspect of this issue. and that is merging of the two insurance funds. This will obviously strengthen the reserve fund for all banks and savings institutions. rather than diffusing that strength between two funds. The second component is that of coverage limits. Although this issue has attracted quite a bit of discussion and controversy over the past few years. this is nonetheless an important issue for many banks and consumers alike. In this section. the legislation authorizes the level of general coverage to rise to $130.000. by indexing for inflation from 1974. when the level of coverage was at $40.000. Going forward. the bill proposes to index coverage for inflation every five years in increments of $10.000. The bill also suggests that coverage for retirement accounts be set at $250.000 now. and that those accounts also be subject to indexing in the future. Lastly. on coverage issues. the legislation would allow for additional coverage for municipal deposits beyond the $130.000 level.",

    "speech": "Act would also allow for greater flexibility for the FDIC to charge insurance premiums. Since 1996. the FDIC has been prohibited from charging premiums to banks that have the highest rating. as long as the reserve ratio was above the hard target\" of 1.25 percent. Our legislation would remove that prohibition. as well as effectively eliminating the hard target. and would instead substitute a range for the fund. Again. these actions will lend the FDIC the necessary flexibility to manage the funds in a much more institutionfriendly manner. particularly by relieving pressure on them during the worst business cycles. In addition. the FDIC will be able to give a onetime assessment credit to institutions. as well as allow for ongoing credits to manage the fund. These credits will in all likelihood give most institutions. if they are wellmanaged and wellcapitalized. the ability to avoid premiums for several years down the road. The FDIC will also be authorized to provide cash rebates to institutions should the fund ever exceed 1.50 percent. Although I would prefer to address the issue of coverage for municipal deposits in another context. I am confident that during the upcoming legislative process there will be a good debate on the issue. and the Senate will be able to work its will on the issue. I think it is important to note that the introduction of this bill will mark the beginning of a strong. vigorous and positive discussion on the vital issue of deposit insurance. This has become the cornerstone of our banking systems integrity. and it is imperative that the U.S. Congress insure that it remain strong. healthy. and workable for many years to come for both financial institutions and consumers alike.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as the government moves to protect its citizens. harden its borders. and defends American interests abroad. I want to make sure that the Nations Federal employees are given the resources and support needed to carry out these missions. Numerous studies point to the governments inability to compete with the private sector as one reason why we are unable to attract and retain qualified Federal employees. With a few exceptions. since 1981. military and Federal personnel have received equal pay increases. Yet. the administrations FY03 budget calls for an acrosstheboard adjustment of only 2.6 percent. while the military would receive a 4.1 percent increase. The proposed 2.6 percent increase is less than the formula used by the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act and fails to close the pay gap between Federal and private sector workers. In my capacity as Chairman of both the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security. Proliferation. and Federal Services and the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support. I am actively involved in issues relating to Federal employees. Our civilian workforce plays a significant role in the support of our service members on active duty. in the reserves. and serving with the National Guard. I support a cohesive and coordinated effort in safeguarding America and believe a strong civilian workforce is crucial to our success in protecting our country. By 2005. over half the Federal workforce will be eligible to retire. and as long as fewer young people are choosing Federal service to fill these gaps. there should be a commitment from the highest levels of government to ensure that agencies are adequately staffed with the right people and the right skills to run the government in an effective and efficient manner. The American people know that the war on terrorism will be a long struggle. a different kind of war with fronts both at home and abroad. Our civilian Federal workforce is on the front line of this war and must be prepared to respond to the possibility of attack. We should not distinguish between our civilian and military workforces. both of whom serve their country with equal dedication.",

I think it is fair to say that we will look back on this period as a time when South Asia became a major focus of U.S. foreign policy. Obviously. Afghanistan has occupied much of our attention. as our forces have routed the Taliban and Al Oaeda forces. which had turned that country into a base for international terrorism. But a South Asian relationship that has perhaps received fewer headlines. but which I believe will prove to have a longlasting and deep value for both countries. is our growing relationship with India. After September 11. when so much changed for America and the world. India immediately stepped forward in full support and solidarity with the United States in the war on terrorism. But this level of cooperation and partnership between the U.S. and India in the struggle against terrorism was nothing new. The two countries had actually been cooperating on counterterrorism efforts since the establishment of the U.S.-India Joint Working Group on Counterterrorism in January 2000. Further. this cooperative system for addressing the problem of terrorism was part of a much larger realignment in relations between the worlds two largest democracies. When President Clinton traveled to India in March 2000the first visit by an American President to India in more than 20 yearsbilateral relations had already been showing signs of slow but steady improvement. President Clintons trip to India. and the visit a few months later in September 2000 by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeemarking the first time that two IndoU.S. summits had taken place in the same yearresulted in the development of a new framework for bilateral relations that was spelled out in \"A Vision for the 21st Century.\" This Vision Statement called for a greater institutional dialogue. including a U.S.-India Financial and Economic Forum. a U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue. a U.S.-India Working Group on Trade. and joint groups dealing with such wideranging issues as energy and environment. science and technology exchange. and cooperation on the promotion of democracy internationally.

Kosciusko County in Northern Indiana is one of the nations largest centers of the medical device industry. I have visited many of the medical device manufacturers in my home state. and continue to be amazed with the marvels that these companies produce every day. Injuries and illnesses that only a decade ago would have been debilitating are now curable. thanks in no small part to the ingenuity and innovation of companies that produce medical devices. H.R. 3580 is a win for both medical device producers and for consumers. It streamlines the process by which medical devices will be approved by the Food and Drug Administration by establishing a new user fee program similar to the one that exists for pharmaceuticals and biologics. By doing so. it helps medical device producers get their products to the marketplace more quickly. making them available to those who need them. The legislation also establishes a new Office of Combination Products at the FDA so that producers of combination drugs and medical devices do not have to be approved by two separate agencies. Even more impressive is that medical device consumers are not being forced to pay for the creation of a new. faster approval system for medical devices. Under this legislation. the companies themselves will fund the expedited process. It is important to note that this expedited procedure will not sacrifice thoroughness for speed. This legislation carefully spells out strict standards to ensure the absolute highest level of safety. On behalf of medical device manufacturers in Warsaw. Indiana as well as those across the nation who benefit from their products. I am pleased to support this bill. and urge its passage.",

On August 30th. they won the WNBA title for the second year in a row. The Sparks were competing against New York Liberty for this years title. It was a competitive series and the decisive game went down to the last couple of seconds. With the game tied at 66. rookie Nikki Teasley got the ball and scored the winning basketa three pointer. putting the team up for good and clinching the championship. Both teams played superbly. It was exciting. a great show of gamesmanship and the fans were treated to an exceptional game. Lisa Leslie was named the series Most Valuable Player. This is an honor she received last year. as well. She finished the game with seventeen points. With this championship. the LA Sparks join the Houston Comets as the only multiple titleholders in the leagues sixyear history. In addition. by winning every playoff game they played. they tied the Comets record of sweeping all six playoff games. The teams winning streak is nine if you count the last three games of the regular season. It was not an easy season. but the women worked hard. played hard and were rewarded for their efforts. That is something from which we can all learn. So as I close. I would like to congratulate the Sparks and thank them for being leaders. I hope they continue to set good examples for our city.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to join my colleague. Congressman MARK UDALL. in introducing the Environmental Justice Act of This bill will codify a 1994 environmental justice Executive Order by President Bill Clinton. Executive Order 12898. the \"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low Income Populations.\" attempts to address environmental injustice within existing federal laws and regulations by prohibiting discriminatory practices in programs that receive federal funds. This issue has been one of my priorities as a public servant because I have seen the damagefirst handthat environmental injustice can bring to poor and minority communities. I grew up in the shadow of one of the largest landfills in the country. As the landfill grew. so did other regional pollution. Gravel pits that are miles wide and hundreds of feet deep were dug to build roads and buildings in California. Heavy industry moved inespecially during World War II when my area manufactured jet fuel. And the rivers that were once freeflowing water bodies were reduced to sewer channels. Areas where my family would picnic or enjoy nature when I was little are now part of the dirtiest watershed in the country. In the Los Angeles area. it is estimated that over 71 percent of African Americans and 50 percent of Latinos reside in areas with the most polluted air. while only 34 percent of whites live in highly polluted areas. Even our open space tends to be divided among financial or other demographic lines. In Los Angeles neighborhoods where 1990 household income averaged less than $20.000 a year. there was less than a halfacre of parkland for every 1.000 residents. The ratio was more than 40 times higher21.2 acres for every 1.000 peoplein neighborhoods where household incomes were $40.000 or higher. Park access was similarly lopsided when broken down by race. Majority white neighborhoods had 95.7 acres of parkland for every 1.000 children. compared with 5 acres in Latino areas. 2.9 acres in AfricanAmerican neighborhoods and 6.3 acres in AsianAmerican areas. In the past we might have accepted our fate but today we chose to fight back. Hardly a day passes without the media informing us about a neighborhood that is fight-",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to express my appreciation for the provision in the Defense Appropriations Conference Report that helps to reaffirm the certainty of the specialty metals clause of the Berry Amendment. The provision in the conference report directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide Congress with estimates of the amount. value. and overall percentage of foreign and domesticsourced specialty metals to be used in the fleet of leased aircraft under the MultiYear Aircraft Lease Pilot Program. The Secretary must compare this data to the specialty metal content of military aircraft the Air Force has procured over the last five years. This measure will provide valuable data to Congress to ensure that the objective of the Berry Amendment and particularly the specialty metals clause of this longstanding procurement rule stands firm. Without proper enforcement of the Berry Amendment. the U.S. titanium industry could shrink and lead the Department of Defense to become dependent on foreign supplies from Russia for this strategic material that is of critical importance to the military aircraft industry.",
