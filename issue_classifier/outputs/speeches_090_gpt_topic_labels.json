    "speech": "Mr. President. very briefly. if I understood the Senator from Hawaii correctly. I share one of the points of view he has. One of the reasons for unrest in this land is that the process seems to be unresponsive in the eyes of a great many of our young people. The system seems not to work. How can we explain to them why a majority of the Senate is not permitted to act? Who thwarts the process if a minority here denies the majority the opportunity to do what the Senator from Hawaii said was the second half of the duty in connection with the Court nomination? The President. who is President. has sent in a name. That was onehalf of the duty as the Senator from Hawaii said. And what is the other half of the duty? We should advise and then either consent or not consent. That Is precisely what we are trying to get ourselves in a position to do. I think we will find a good many young Americans unable to make a distinction as to why it is wrong for them to shout down at a meeting the majority effort to resolve some community problem and. at the same time. why it is perfectly all right for the minority of the Senate to deny a process of this institution. I hope that we will not get caught in this trap. It follows that until we are permitted to have the nomination before us. any time taken by those of us supporting the nomination contributes tocall it what you willdelay or filibuster. Nonetheless. I should like the RECORD today to include two items: First. the question was raised that there might have been an appearance of a conflict of interest. since after Justice Fortas went on the Court. a litigant whom he had represented in private practice was involved in an obscenity case before the Court. This aspect concerned. understandably. the able junior Senator from New York. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a letter dated July 26. 1968. which appears on page 312 of the hearing record on this nomination. addressed to Chairman EASTLAND. from the law firm of Arnold & Porter.",

    "speech": "Second. mention was made of a canon of judicial ethics of the American Bar Association. Highly relevant is another canon. Canon 31. This canon is found on page 6 of the report of the committee on this nomination. The committee footnote comments: I Canon 31 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics of the American Bar Association clearly contemplates that judges are entitled to receive compensation for lectures and articles on legal subjects. The canon states. in relevant part: \"He [a judge] may properly act as arbitrator or lecture upon or Instruct in law. or write upon the subject. and accept compensation therefor. If such course does not interfere with the due performance of his Judicial duties. and is not forbidden by some positive provision of law.\" I agree with the early comment of my able colleague from Michigan that the burden of proof is on those of us who believe that the Senate should consent to this nomination. That burden of proof will be assumed and can be assumed. but it becomes in order only after the Senate agrees to take up the nomination. That is the question before the Senate. Paraphrasing it. it is something like this: Please let us consider the nomination of Mr. Justice Fortas. Once the Senate is permitted to do this. the case can be made. and the next question resolves: Shall we consent to the nomination? Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

The Senator from Colorado and I have figured that over the period of the 14 years we have been handling this bill. we have been under the budget figure by some $9.876 million. I think that is a pretty good record. We get into a lot of trouble about it. People do not like us to cut out things. But we have. over the years. cut the budget $9.876 million. This independent offices and Department of Housing and Urban Development appropriation bill includes the Space Agency which. as we all know. carries a vast sum. It also includes the Veterans Administration in which most of the costs are fixed. It is very difficult to cut in the Veterans Administration because. by law. their items are fixed and VA costs have constantly gone up. This year it is $6.977 million$7 billion in round figures. The conference report and the bill also includes HUD and rather large sums for model cities. rent supplements. and urban renewaland all these other items. The conference report mainly goes along with the Senate and House bill. We did not compromise too much. It is under the budget figure. I want to repeat this figure. by $3.703 million---and the budget was quite austere on some of these matters as it was sent to the Congress. I want to compliment the members of the subcommitteeI guess that rubs off a little bit on me. toowe have been doing intensive work on this very important and complex bill.

Many of us have asked ourselves the question. \"What can I do?\" One of the best answers I have had the privilege of reading was made in the remarks of the Honorable James A. Fitzpatrick. chairman of the Power Authority of the State of New York. at a communion Fisc I breakfast of the National Alumni Association at Siena College in Albany. N.Y.. in June of this year. Mr. Fitzpatrick is one of the outstanding lawyers in New York State. In his remarks. he has set forth six principles which he feels all alumni who care for their institutions should reaffirm and promote. exerting their efforts and influence at the campus level. I am pleased to insert Mr. Fitzpatricks remarks in the RECORD for the benefit of all my colleagues.",

Congress would. in effect. be taking advantage of funds made available through the new tax bill which was enacted with the promise that Government spending be reduced to the very minimum. Instead of being first to dip into the added revenue. Congress should set an example for the executive department by doing everything possible to make certain that the surtax will be removed at an early date. If somehow the pension increase becomes law. it will be quick substantiation of my position in opposing the new taxthat you do not cut down on Government expenditures by increasing revenue. The plan to act upon this legislation without a rollcall vote is particularly deplorable. If a Member of Congress feels that it is not unfair for him to vote for better retirement benefits for himself at a time when the overburdened taxpayer is already carrying a record budget. then he should at least be willing to go on record for the information of his constituents. I appeal to my colleagues not to make this selfish move. Least of all. do not lack courage to put yourself on record whether or not you are in favor of the pension increase.",

Mrs. Sandburg visited my hometown of Greensboro. N.C.. and participated in events arranged by the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce. The Greensboro Chamber. which sponsors a program of work which is conspicuously people oriented. has often reached for Sandburg themes to help tell its story. The death of the North Carolina poet last year was not only Greensboros loss. or Flat Rocks. or North Carolinas. So it seemed to the Greensboro Chamber. when it began to organize an appropriate memorial tribute to Sandburg. that a meaningful tribute should have a national setting. The chamber commissioned a musical work by North Carolina composer. M. Thomas Cousins. Greenboros composerinresidence in memory of Sandburg. and Mr. Cousins spent some time with Mrs. Sandburg at Greensboro and Flat Rock while he was working on the composition. \"Skald of Flat Rock.\" The Northern Virginia Music Center sent a concert. including the Cousins sent a concern. including the Cousins work. as its contribution to the Sandburg event which the chamber was organizingand the chambers plans tonight will materialize on the Mall In front of the Smithsonian Institutions Natural History Building. when the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce and the Smithsonian Institution jointly present the first national memorial tribute to the beloved poet of \"The People.

Sandburg was a legislator in many respectsand his poems will be read and understood by Americans for generations to come. The words to Mr. Cousins composition. \"Skald of Flat Rock.\" tell something of Mr. Sandburgs important spokesmanship for the people and his effect as an articulate observer of our countrys industrial growth. The name of the work suggests Sandburgs Scandinavian heritage as a troubadour and poet and recalls his longtime residence at Flat Rock. N.C. As the words of \"Skald of Flat Rock.\" written by H. A.

By advocating a suspension of the bombing of North Vietnam. subject only to observance of the demilitarized zone by North Vietnam. a gradual U.S. troop withdrawal under international supervision. and South Vietnam elections specifically including the National Liberation Front. the Vice President made his peaceinVietnam program clear. Thus the American people have been put on notice on precisely the kind of peaceinVietnam program they will be voting for if they vote for HUMPHREY. However. it would be foolish to equate the Vice Presidents stand with a complete turnaround on Vietnam. The HUMPHREY proposals simply represent another means to the same enda safe and democratic South Vietnamese Government free from Communist aggression. The bombing halt would be conditional. depending upon North Vietnams willingness to restore the integrity of the demilitarized zone between North and South. The withdrawal of American troops would depend upon a reciprocal withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops. And the participation of the National Liberation Front in an elected government would be contingent upon the willingness of the front to abide by peaceful processes.

I am told there is a good management at the head of. that company. that they have experienced personnel. and I think on the whole they do a commendable job of providing a transit system for the District of Columbia. I am not sure I can vouchsafe or certify as strongly the wisdom of the financial management of the company. This has been a bootstrap operation. They put in very little money of their own. and they are trying to build the company and its assets through the farebox. I do not object to that. but I do object to their paying out the money in dividends and then coming in and claiming they are in a poor cash position. I think the Transit Commission which regulates this company does not do such a bad job. and they gave the company a fare increase effective as of the end of January. and the realities are that during the first 3 months of this year. the company earned approximately $300.000 more than it had in the comparable 3 months in 1967. It is also a fact that when April and May came along. the company had some problems with revenue because of the results of the riots and some other difficulties with which we in Washington have all been familiar. So. if we were to pass this. and to make it work prospectively. this company has all kinds of unencumbered assets upon which they could borrow to improve the cash position. We should pass the bill and look from now on forward. They can go to the bank and get whatever credit they need. against this prospective payment. This would put the company in a stronger position. and would allow the Rapid Transit Commission to set rates in accordance with new sources of income which would be provided by the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on June 13 the House passed a poultry inspection bill which parallels the meat inspection bill passed last year. Last week the Senate Agriculture Committee added some seriously crippling amendments. One amendment permits interstate shipment of both meat and poultry products from a State which at one time came up to Federal standards. When a State fails to stay up to Federal standards. it takes several months to get them back up to that standard. and in the meantime. that meat could be shipped all over the United States. That law that we passed. for the first time. requires imported meat to come up to Federal standards. and there is no exception. If the Senate amendments were to become law. then the way consumers could be sure the meat they are eating meets Federal standards would be to buy imported meat. I am not against foreign competition. but we surely should not have a situation where consumers would have to buy imported products to be assured of quality. Another amendment practically prohibits rejecting poultry which is diseased or contaminated with intestinal wastes. An Agriculture Department investigation early this year in which they purchased birds in 37 retail stores in the United States found that 82 percent of the nonfederally inspected poultry examined failed to meet Federal standards. That report secured and made public by Nick Kotz of the Des Moines Registers Washington bureau gives an indication of what could be expected if the Senate amendments passed and permitted this poultry to be sold nationwide. Legislation that will protect consumers from a few firms whose total interest is the almighty dollar even if it causes people to become ill is hard to pass. but we are also seeing that it is hard to keep. If these amendments are not taken out in the Senate. the House should reject them and I intend to keep the House informed concerning this proposition. Meanwhile I think Members should read the newspaper article by Nick Kotz. and I am inserting it in the RECORD at this time. It is as follows: [From the Des Moines (Iowa) Sunday Register.

They will not suffer the false practice of Congress giving them halfdollars of financial help and taking from them full dollars in taxes. They will not interminably be duped. they will awaken to the evils and the abuses which are being heaped upon them. Pending before the Senate is a bill that would require the taxpayers of the United States to finance the election campaigns of elective Federal officials. The elective Federal officials are the President. the Vice President. the Members of the Senate. and the Members of the House of Representatives. It is estimated that this fantastic scheme to finance partly with taxpayers money the political campaigns of Federal elective officials will cost the taxpayers approximately $100 million in every presidential election and somewhat less in nonpresidential years. The Government of the United States already has a debt of $335 billion. Pending before the Congress is a recommendation of the President that a 10 percent surtax be adopted to reduce the huge deficit which faces the people of our Nation. Many citizensand I join themare urging that there be a cutback in spending. thus eliminating the necessity of imposing the 10percent surtax. The spending program must be slowed down in the interest of the fiscal and monetary security of our Nation.",

    "speech": "The passage of this unjust campaign subsidy billand I want to repeat that: this unjust campaign subsidy billwill be a disservice to the people and will stimulate increased disrespect for the actions of Congress. This proposal shows a disrespect for the intelligence of the taxpayers. Written into the bill are provisions that would take out of the Federal Treasury $14 million each for the Democratic and Republican candidates for President. also $26 million more for senatorial candidates. It is proposed that when the bill is before the House of Representatives. the House shall determine for itself how much additional subsidy shall be made available for the candidates who run for membership in the House every 2 years. The bill also grants a tax credit to private contributors to campaign funds. This provision. if it should go through. has been calculated to mean an additional drain on the Treasury of $50 to $60 million. The highlight of the insult to the taxpayers. however. is found by the provisions of the bill which would allow the candidates for President and for the offices of Senator and Representative to solicit private contributions in the future as they have been solicited in the past to finance the campaign expenses taking place earlier than 60 days before and 30 days after the election. The excessive spending of money in political campaigns has been the bane against decent and honest elections in the United States. The pending bill will merely aggravate the evils and the corruptions that come from the possession of excessive finances in political campaign operations. If this bill is ultimately adopted. the taxpayers of our country will be considered as sheep. not only to be fleeced. but also to be flayed. I concur fully with the members of the Committee on Finance who voted against this proposal. The bill should be resoundly defeated.

As the Senator from Ohio points out. under the bill the candidates themselves could continue to solicit money for campaign purposes and expend that moneyany amount of itduring the 10 months of the year prior to an election. For example. a Member of the Senate could solicit and use private contributions to finance his campaign for reelection for 5 years and 10 months. and then for 2 months before the election he could stop and go public. but even then it would be impossible to differentiate between the expenditures. As a single example. if he bought bumper stickers he could distribute thousands or millions of them. with brochures. ahead of time. before the election. When the time for private financing ended. the stickers would all be distributed. They would not be torn off. and the expense would have been paid. It is impossible to commingle public and private money under an accurate accounting system.",

I do not think that Members of the Congress would have the gall to go home and tell the taxpayers that they are going to have to shoulder the cost of their campaigns for reelection. There was a time when a man running for public office would stand before the taxpayers and say that all he was or hoped to be he owed to his mother. But in this case. with a huge deficit and no possible chance of reducing it. we know that the money appropriated must be borrowed. the burden will have to be borne by future generations. Therefore. I suggest it would be more appropriate now for candidates in a campaign to say. \"Whatever I am or hope to be I owe to the future generations of American taxpayers.\" Since the Senate is composed so largely of grandfathers and the White House has a new grandfather. I am confident that those who will be up for reelection next year will think twice before they say. \"I am going to impose this burden on that little grandson in Texas.\" or on my granddaughter over in Delaware. One additional point which should be noted in connection with this campaign financing bill is that the appropriation of $14 million for the presidential campaign does not stop the contribution to or membership in the $1.000Presidents Club. nor does it in anyway restrict the two national parties or the various State organizations from soliciting public contributions throughout the year. Neither are there any restrictions in the expenditures of these funds on behalf of the party in general. even during the time that the candidate individually is using the public money. This proposal is wrong. and it should be defeated. Neither Congress nor the President has any right to ask the taxpayers to finance our elections.",

He says that a wellmeaning white American asks: Where else in the world do colored people enjoy a higher standard of living and greater opportunities for advancement than in America? Judge McCree then goes on to wonder if it would be impertinent if somebody would ask. in rejoinder to that frequently mentioned question: Where else in the world do Catholics. Protestants. Jews. Englishmen. Scotsmen. Italians. and the rest of us enjoy a higher standard of living or greater opportunity? The question so often mentioned is wide and. as Judge McCree so dramatically forces us to recognize. it demonstrates our complete failure to accept the proposition that the American Negro is as much an American as any white American. and that the circumstances of Negroes should not be compared with those of anyone else anywhere else in the world.",

We are referring to those decisions which have caused so much anxiety among so many Americans today. including the one on prayer and those decisions relating to criminal proceedings.

I refer to the demand of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice that the Jet Commander aircraft made by the AeroCommander Division of RockwellStandard be divested as a condition to approval of the merger between RockwellStandard and North American Aviation. Inc. This unrealistic and indefensible decision by the powersthatbe in the executive branch actually may have just the opposite effect of what is intended by the antitrust lawto strengthen competition. It is almost certainly going to reduce the employment opportunities in this country. while at the same time give foreign aircraft manufacturers. which last year made more than half the executive jets sold in the United States. an even larger market in this country. It is almost certainly going to affect our already difficult balanceofpayments problem adversely. RockwellStandard Corp.. the parent company of AeroCommander. says it has sold the Jet aircraft project to the Israeli Government for $25 million. The Justice Department had demanded the divestiture on grounds the AeroCommander jet and North Americans highly successful business jet aircraft would otherwise dominate or monopolize the market for such planes. With the market domination of the foreign manufacturers. this simply isnt borne out by the facts. The Justice Department is wrong. The AeroCommander jet and the North American jet offer far different service characteristics to the prospective buyer. and one costs nearly twice as much as the other. The Justice Departments error apparently will mean the surrender of one of the best U.S.-built executive jets to a foreign nation. It will destroy one of our important manufacturing resources for a type of highly sophisticated machinery which our security requires. Directly affected by this bureaucratic bungling is a fine team of aircraft builders in Oklahoma City. Okla. The incomes of several hundred people are threatened by this cavalier fiat from the Federal executive branch. I do not believe the American people will endure such bungling and selfdefeating tactics as these. An indication of the public outrage caused by this particular incident is reflected in an editorial entitled \"Government by Whim.\" published in the Daily Oklahoman. Oklahoma City. on September 12.

The question is what is the most efficient manner in which to handle the job training program and just how much can we afford.

This figure included those who were temporarily laid off as well as those poorly trained. Which figure is correct? Where do they get these statistics? Are more people suddenly getting on poverty rolls. and is the administration planning on bankrupting another couple of million in the next 2 years by inflation which will result from their increased spending policies?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a speech entitled \"Excellence in the National Public Service.\" was recently delivered by Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler on the occasion of the 1966 Rockefeller Public Service Awards luncheon. It gives me particular pleasure to place this speech in the RECORD because John R. Blandford. the chief counsel of. my committee. is a recipient of this award. It has been well said that no man is indispensable. however. Russ Blandford approaches this ideal so closely that I find it hard to imagine the Armed Services Committee operating without him. Certainly. Its efficiency and effectiveness would be vastly diminished were he not here. Russ Blandford. in his many years of service. has acquired an immense knowledge of our Nations military structure. I think it is safe to say that he knows more about the armed services than anyone in the Pentagonor anywhere else around Washington. He has always shown a tremendous energy for his work. He has given without hesitation of what should have been his own time. His hours are long and run from dawn to dark every day. Yet. with all this burden. he never fails to find time to help every member of the committee. whether he be Democrat or Republican. senior member or freshman. With all of this. he has remained quietly behind the scenes. often unnoticed and unrewarded while the glory went to others. Because of this. I was especially pleased to find that he was to receive a Rockefeller Public Service Award. No one deserved it more. Secretary Fowlers speech. which further explains the principle of these awards. follows:",

The National Endowment for the Humanities was established to support exploration Into the nature of man and his culture and to deepen understanding of the goals of human activity. The first years activities have been devoted to developing plans to strengthen scholarship and teaching in the humanities and to foster greater public appreciation and understanding of the humanities. These plans provide the basis for programs which will Increase the number of outstanding scholars in the humanities through annual fellowship awards to some 350 individualsboth promising and established scholars. heighten public understanding of the humanities through improvements in education in the school. in the home. and in the community. support research in specific fields to expand the range to our knowledge. enable American scholars to make a greater contribution to the exchange of knowledge essential to international understanding. More than 100 outstanding educators and scholars have advised the endowment in the development of these programs. The views of these and other great humanists will be sought as plans for subsequent years are developed. I am satisfied that the National Endowment for the Humanities has established a firm foundation for extending the boundaries of our understanding. It is with great satisfaction that I now submit to you this record of its achievement.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I introduce. for appropriate reference. two bills to amend the War Claims Act of 1948. The first of these bills would benefit two classes of claimants who have not yet received recognition of their claims. These are. first. refugees from nazism and other tyrannies who became citizens of the United States after their property was seized. and. second. prisoners of war and internees who have personal injury claims. Both these groups of citizens suffered at the hands of our enemies and are entitled. in my judgment. to share in the war claims fund being distributed to these victims. Former Senator Douglas. of Illinois. long shared my interest in this measure and. for years. joined with me as a sponsor of this bill. We fought for it on many occasions. and. as happens so often with respect to problems which are before the Senate. some day we may win. In any case. we must continue to press the issue. The second bill would create a preference for religious and nonprofit groups who suffered losses during the war. Under present law. only small businesses have a preference. and the purpose of my proposal is simply to put these churches and welfare organizations on the same footing as private businesses in pressing their claims. Some of the groups which would be specifically affected are YaleinChina. Bnai Brith. and numerous Catholic and Protestant groups. When the original War Claims Act was passed in 1948. small businesses were given a priority in order to put them in a better position visavis big business. which had already received considerable tax benefits because of its losses. The problem of the nonprofit organization. however. was apparently neglected. and the purpose of this bill is to remedy the situation by creating equal priorities for small business and nonprofit groups. Senator KENNEDY of Massachusetts joins me in offering this measure.",

Senator HICKENLOOPER. and Senator MILLER are joining me in sponsorship. The bill is small from the standpoint of our National Highway System. but is extremely important to many citizens in northeast Nebraska and northwest Iowa. The bill would extend the Interstate Highway System a very short distance to provide a new bridge across the Missouri River between South Sioux City. Nebr.. and Sioux City. Iowa. The present bridge across the river Is more than 100 years old. Mr. President. It is totally inadequate to carry the traffic. Interstate Highway 29 is a northsouth highway. along the west edge of Iowa and the east bank of the Missouri River. This highway should be accessible to the people of northeast Nebraska because it is a national highway. 90 percent of the cost of which has been paid .by Federal taxpayers. At the present time. northeast Nebraska is for practical purposes denied access to this highway because of the Inadequate. rundown condition of the present bridge. The condition of the bridge also is a hazard to a steady stream of summer tourists traveling from coast to coast along eastwest Highway 20. also a Federal highway. The bill would add 2.4 miles to the Interstate System. This would permit an additional turnout from Interstate 29 on the Iowa side. The bridge would connect the interstate with U.S. Highway 77 and U.S. Highway 20. I believe this approach is thoroughly justified and absolutely necessary in order to meet the growing population and travel needs of the Nation. At present our expensive Interstate Highway System does not serve great portions of our population. I believe that the construction of spurs. such as the one proposed by this measure. will make this National System of Interstate Highways serve a much greater portion of our population. Without this proposed spur. northeast Nebraska is denied the use of a northsouth interstate highway which Is being paid for by all taxpayers. In addition this bridge is needed badly to take care of the IowaNebraska eastwest traffic.",

Ariz.. title to certain real property which will become surplus to the needs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture after the end of the current fiscal year. Following the discontinuation of agricultural research. the Department of Agriculture intends to phase out the poultry research project which has been conducted at this location since 1921. and to close down the station permanently. Prior to the establishment of this station in 1921. the citizens of Glendale. through private subscriptions. raised the necessary funds to pay for the acquisition of the property and it was then deeded to the Secretary of Agriculture. Subsequently. the Department acquired an addition to this station by condemnation and a court award of $4.500 for the additional property. In view of the fact that a portion of the lands used for poultry research were donated to the Government. the bill proposes that the entire tract be made available to the city of Glendale for a public park. Further. the bill provides that the price shall be fixed by the Secretary of Agriculture in the same manner and at the same price that the Secretary of the Interior fixes the price for lands sold under section 2(a) of the act entitled \"An act to authorize acquisition or use of public lands by States. counties. or municipalities for recreational purposes.\" approved June 14. 1926 (44 Stat. 741. 43 U.S.C. 8691).",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the legislation which I am about to introduce is designed to alleviate the economic losses which have been. and continue to be. suastained by American citizens on the high seas off South America and in other areas. Mr. President. the world presently recognizes 12 miles as the maximum jurisdiction which any nation may claim exclusively for either territorial or fishery rights. Despite this. the American tuna and shrimp fleets continue to be harassed by foreign nations in waters which this Nation. and the rest of the world. for that matter. recognizes as the high seas. I am particularly concerned today with the plight of the American tuna fleet which ranges off South and Central America. primarily from ports in southern California. This is not. however. a problem of concern only to Californians. for a number of people from the Pacific Northwest are builders. owners. and/or operators of tuna vessels. Since the early part of this century. the American fishing fleets have been carefully developing the tuna fisheries in this area. In 1966 alone. 14 U.S. tuna vessel seizure incidents occurred in the Eastern Pacific. owners of nine such vessels have paid nearly $85.000 in fines to foreign governments for the purpose of securing the release of their vessels and crews. Although the Department of State has been unable to prevent these seizures. which. I might note. are continuing in 1967. Public Law 680 of the 83d Congress. commonly referred to as the U.S. Vessel Protective Act. provides for reimbursement to the amount of the fine actually paid to the foreign country in order to secure the prompt release of the vessel and crew. This is. of course. necessary. but it does not provide for any reimbursement for damage or destruction of the vessel. loss or damage of fishing gear or other equipment. dockage fees. utilities or seized fish. Nor is there any provision for lost fishing time. Mr. President. earlier I mentioned some of the seizures which have occurred. I have here a memorandum. prepared by Mr. August Felando. general manager of the American Tunaboat Association of San Diego. Calif.. which not only sets forth in detail some of the more recent incidents. but provides a summary of the seizures. detentions. and harassments which occurred in 1966. noting the countries involved.

Mr. Donaldson states that Government agents came out to his land. looked at it. and said that 23 acres had been planted. Mr. Donaldson contended that there were only 14. The Government then certified a fine against him and finally obtained a judgment in the amount of $322 as a penalty for overplanting the allotted quota. On March 29. 1967. the Government filed suit to sell Donaldsons farm. It wants the $322 penalty plus 6 percent interest since 1958. and court costs. In the editorial of the New London Record on March 30. entitled \"The Final Curtain.\" the editorial states: In a day when the rights of criminals are held above the rights of society. the rights of a small farmer to at least defend himself should be self evident.

Instead of being geared to the educational needs of the 80 per cent who are not college bound. the public school system aims at enabling children to pass college board exams. Thus eight out of ten pupils attend classes not furnishing them with what they urgently need in early teenage life. and not preparing them for a real life situation after the age of 18. She further states: If New York City were equipped with an outstanding vocational and technical education system. it is most likely that during 1966 there would have been a decreased not increased juvenile crime rate ... Mr. President. I thoroughly agree with her views that our elementary schools should be teaching trades and other usable occupations so that boys and girls who do not go to college will be equipped for a livelihood. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have this excellent article printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. how long must the Congress wait before it obtains reasonably firm estimates on the costs of this airplane and accurate information about its operational characteristics? We have been asked to appropriate large sums of money this year for the production of a weapons system that is now admittedly unsuitable for combat use by the Armed Forces. Why is this plane. although still unsatisfactory. now rolling off the assembly line? Why has the Secretary of Defense refused to furnish appropriate cost estimates of this program? These are serious questions which should be examined closely before we appropriate billions of dollars to produce the F111 in quantity. Mr. President. the Congress should not be expected to speculate upon the validity of requests for appropriations. They should be substantiated and justified. Reliable estimates of the costs of this weapons system should be supplied by the Secretary of Defense. This aircraft has not been thoroughly or adequately tested. yet we are asked to appropriate the money to purchase it in large numbers for operational use. Development of the engine for the Navy plane is underway. but it will not soon be ready for testing. There will be no prototype of it. according to testimony. until May of next year. The Navy version has not even finished its preliminary testing. yet the Defense Department plans. if we give it the money. to place it in production even before the new engine. which the Navy hopes will improve its performance. has been developed. produced. and satisfactorily tested. I believe that the Congress should require complete and accurate information about all the costs and the operational characteristics of the F111 weapons system In all its versions. I do not acceptnor do I believe that the Congress should countenanceany suggestion that the Defense Department has the right to request appropriations for an admittedly unsatisfactory aircraft while withholding information about its costs and about its performance capabilities. We have a responsibility to know what we are doingto know what we are gettingand what it is costing. when we appropriate money to purchase these planes. Some day. Mr. President. notwithstanding the withholding of this vital information by the Defense Department. we will get and disseminate much more of the truth about this weapons procurement program. The day of reckoning surely cannot be postponed indefinitely. ExHIBrr 1",

I asked you what laws are on the books which would allow the President to give military aid to any country known as a Communist country. referring specifically to the Foreign Assistance Act? There are none. and no military aid is being given to any Communist country. Mr. Chairman. I take second place to no one in my determination to prohibit the sending of military arms to any country. as we say in this new time of cold war. known as a Communist nation. Mr. Chairman. I was one of the authors of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1950. known as the Battle Act. which was the first major law designed to deny arms and aid to Communist countries. I have continued over the years in supporting our adherence to the provisions of that act and the operations which are carried on under that law. I had a great deal to do in the Committee on Foreign Affairs with reference to the other law referred to by my colleague. the gentleman from New Jersey . the Foreign Assistance Act. and I have particular reference to section 620(b) of that act which lists all those countries to which no aid is to be extended. Mr. Chairman. I want to add that as a result of these laws. we have denied military equipment and other forms of aid to Communist countries for many years. We all remember. of course. that President Eisenhower some years ago made a determination which allowed the sale of our farm surpluses to Poland. In a letter sent to the Committee on Foreign Affairs he explained fully his reasons for that action as a result thereof. Public Law 480. surplus commodities were subsequently sold to Poland. I must say this. that the Polish people have appreciated that gesture on our part and that the good will generated by those sales helped to demonstrate that the free people on the other side of the Iron Curtain had not forgotten them. So. Mr. Chairman. I say at this time that the new language proposed in the bill before us does not improve our law prohibiting aid to Communist countries. Such aid is already prohibited and the bill simply creates confusion and uncertainty. For that reason. I support the amendment of the gentleman from New Jersey .",

As the gentleman from Indiana just pointed out. the only prohibition indicated in section 109(a) relates to items. military items. contained on a list determined by the Administrator or AID pursuant to title I of the National Defense Assistance Control Act (22 U.S.C.A. 1611(a)). Under that act. if the Administrator desires to declassify an item as military equipment. he may take it off the list which is provided under title I. I think this just goes to point out the very serious dangers of taking up this kind of a provision on a bill that is primarily related to appropriations. Actually. the door is open a great deal wider under section 109(a) than it is opened under any permissive provisions under any other act.

He read only subsection (b) of that section. I suggest that the gentleman from Louisiana read also subsection (f) which has a more direct bearing on the issue at hand. Subsection (6) reads: No assistance shall be furnished under this act . . . to any Communist country... The words \"no assistance under this act\" mean both military and economic assistance. There are no \"ifs\" or \"buts\" about it. Both types of aid are already prohibited. and the act spells out. as the gentleman from New Jersey has pointed out. the three conditions under which the President can waive this prohibition. Those three conditions are more stringent than any language proposed in the bill before us. It pains me to see that it is the Members on the other side of the aisle who have led the fight to retain the language of existing law and who thereby have demonstrated confidence in our President. It is on this side of the aisle that we find people who apparently do not have sufficient confidence in our President to expect him to administer section 620(f) in a manner that serves the interests of our Nation. Under the present act. no Communist country Is receiving military assistance. and the gentleman from Louisiana knows that. This proposed language in the bill is window dressing.

Among the charges repeatedly hurled at it has been the one that the Institute really is not what its record shows it to be. that. on the contrary. it is really an instrument of the CIA and not the unique experiment in cooperation between labor. enlightened businessmen. and government set up by President Kennedys Labor Advisory Committee on the Alliance for Progress to help develop a strong. free labor movement in Latin America. In the past. this charge was limited to publication chiefly in Communist propaganda organs. and therefore it received little credence. Unfortunately. however. it has recently been repeated by some newspapers in this country which. apparently unaware of this charges origins. falsely named the AIFLD as one of the agencies receiving secret CIA funds to support its activities. Actually. the only source of Government funds used by the American Institute for Free Labor Development has been the Agency for International Development. and these funds have been openly voted by Congress and are annually audited by the Appropriations Committees of both the House and Senate. as well as by the Executive Council of the AFLCIO. I am confident that we can take the word of AFLCIO President George Meany. who is also President of the AIFLD. that the Institute has had no hidden sources of funds and that the charge of CIA financing of the Institute Is wholly imaginary.

Our urban cores require vast new economic development to give every resident a good job in his own community. The key concept of our proposals is local initiative. Too often in the past. in both rural and urban areas. our antipoverty programs have allowed the poor people to become bewildered spectators to a march of bureaucratic expansion. Too often our free enterprise system has had no inducement to develop in poor areas. in ways that would materially and psychologically benefit the residents themselves.

The Postmaster General has indicated that his proposal to stop Saturday mail delivery is the result of governmental economy restrictions which the Congress included in the recent surtax bill. Specifically. the Postmaster General has stated that Saturday delivery curtailnent is related to manpower cuts ordered in the surtax measure. That is one reason why I voted against the surtax bill and its meatax approach to economy in Government. The failure to direct specific cuts toward wasteful programs and programs which could be delayed leaves hanging over us the constant threat of discontinuation of good programs and vital services. Cuts to eliminate waste and inefficiency have my fullest support. but I hardly believe that one can call the Saturday delivery of our mails wasteful or unnecessary. Therefore. I shall support pending legislation to exempt the mailhandling operations of the Post Office Department from manpower restrictions. and thus permit the Department to continue Saturday delivery service and to prevent the permanent closing of hundreds of thirdand fourthclass post offices throughout the country. as wel.",

The Senate has not been alone. Public and private citizens throughout New England have felt these costs most immediately and have urged effective action. Finding that \"New England electric consumers. residential. commercial and industrial. pay the highest rates in the continental United States for their electricity and that this high cost of power is an obvious detriment to our regions prosperity and continued economic development.\" the New England Governors Conference recently called for a 6month study of the electric industry in New England. In their most recent meeting. held in Stowe. Vt.. the Governors of all six States recognized the importance of findingonce and for allthe causes of these rates and what can be done to lower them. I feel certain that the findings of this study will support the importance of the construction of the DickeyLincoln hydroelectric facility.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. American trade with the rest of the world last month showed the first deficit in 5 years. This is especially disturbing in view of the huge and continuing deficit in the overall U.S. balanceofpayments position. During March. U.S. exports dropped 11.5 percent below the February level. while imports increased 0.4 percent. resulting in an adverse trade balance of $157.7 million. It is interesting to note that the Washington Post of April 25. 1968. reporting on the meeting of the 21nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. said: The Common Market nations themselves enjoyed a healthy trade surplus in the JanuaryMarch quarter thanks partly to steel shipments to the United States. Despite much brave talk from administration about the urgency of bringing the U.S. balanceofpayments position into balance. the fact is that it is getting worse. Some of the purchasing policies of our own Government are aggravating the American trade deficit. Here is an illustration: On April 11. 1968. bids were let by the Bureau of Reclamation on the Fort ThompsonGrand Island power transmission line. The contract for $6.067.578. included $1.737.062 of materials to be obtained from foreign sources. An unsuccessful bidder. Lindberg Construction Co.. of Jamestown. N. Dak.. bid $6.245.220. which included $230.266 of foreign components. Mr. Don Lindberg advises me that it was the large differential in imported materials which enabled his competitor to make the lower bid. Among these items was some $200.000 worth of imported steel. I do not believe in placing undue restrictions on U.S. commerce with other nations. I would like to see world trade expanded. But this must be a twoway street. Everyone knows that this country is in a severe financial crisis. I sometimes think that officials of foreign governments recognize this even more clearly than our own officials. The United States cannot continue to run a balanceofpayments deficit of $3 to $4 billion a year. along with a budget deficit of $20 to $25 billion. The dollar is in peril both at home and abroad. In such circumstances. it is especially distressing to see the Government undertake purchasing policies which add to the drain on the dollar.",

I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished gentleman from New York on this matter of immigration because it is quite apparent now that the law we passed a few years ago was a very unfair law. and it discriminates against many countries In the northern part of Europe. particularly Ireland. This law. which will take full effect. as I understand. on July 1 of this year. will reduce the number of people who come to our country from Ireland below a figure of 100 per year. It seems to me that the Congress never intended such a harsh result to take effect. It would seem to me that the bill which was introduced by the gentleman from New York would deal with this problem in a fair way. I believe that we should keep the door to America open. I believe in the words inscribed at the foot of the Statue of Liberty: \"Send me your poor and your huddled masses.\" This principle should prevail in this country. and it has always been our philosophy. I do not think we should have a law in effect which will deprive a small country like Ireland from having a fair number to immigrate here. As the gentleman from New York has pointed out. the Irish people over the centuries have made great contributions to the building of this Nation. The forebears of our late beloved President. John F. Kennedy. came from Ireland. You can read the long list of all the great Irish names who have played a part in the history of this countryin the Revolutionary War. the War Between the States. the SpanishAmerican War. World War I. World War II. the Korean conflict. and even today in Vietnamand you will find the names of many heroes of Irish descent. We are doing a real injustice here and we are depriving America of future leaders. So I hope the Members of the Congress will take heed of the statements that are being made by the distinguished Member from New York. I hope the Committee on the Judiciary will act in an expeditious manner on this problem and do so before July 1 of this year.",

Certainly the strength of our country lies in the diversity of the people who come here from many civilizations. Having such a diversity assures that our country will consist of openminded people rather than those who are grounded in a narrow parochialism of centuries of living together without the introduction of new blood. Therefore I salute the gentleman from New York because he is suggesting that we relax the present rules. which I think were introduced for a good purpose. but certainly they were introduced in such a fashion that they did not take into account the sudden harm that might be done to some countries. especially those in Europe which are apparently going to be cut back beyond what they should. Therefore. I do feel now that this measure and the bill I have introduced. along with the relaxation of this sudden change. is very much in the interest of the United States in a practical way and also accords with our traditions",

It is equally significant that the remedy which is proposed in no way adversely affects any nation whose immigration position was improved by the 1965 amendments. It. in effect. permits the entry of an additional 20.000 to 30.000 immigrants worldwide annually and permits the continued flow of immigrants from Ireland and other affected northern and western European countries. This is remedial legislation which extends the concepts of freer immigration embodied in the 1965 amendments and permits us to continue to benefit from the infusion of new peoples into our national life and culture. It is unthinkable that in accomplishing this goal in 1965 we should stifle the flow of Irish immigration. creativity. and that special luster which the Irish have given this Nation.

We removed the onus by passing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Unquestionably. the act has erased some inequities and has contributed to a more just form of immigration in the sense of reuniting families and attracting immigrants with needed skills. Yet. at the same time. by requiring a labor certificate. we inadvertently threw up a barrier against many nations who sent us the \"new seed\" in years past from which this country grew. Specifically. prospective immigrants from Ireland have been the most adversely affected by the 1965 act. On July 1 the 1965 act will be fully implemented and the old quota system will vanish into limbo. With it will also disappear Irish immigration to American shores. Some of us foresaw this and introduced legislation to eliminate the labor certificate requirement and restore the original provision under which the Secretary of Labor made the determination upon which entry was based. With the expiration of the old quota system now only 3 months away. and with the competition for places by other nations which may be supplying a large number of immigrants under preference categories. it is too late to act on that previously planned course of action. The only way left open to us to avoid discriminating against countries which. for generations. have provided the great majority of our immigrant stock is to put some kind of floor under immigration from countries like Ireland which have been the hardest hit. Twentyone of my distinguished colleagues and I have done precisely that in H.R. 16593. It is imperative that we act quickly before the gateway to America is closed in the face of Ireland.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. surely it is not necessary to remind this House of the great contributions to the United States made by Irish immigrants and their sons and daughters. Before the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. Ireland was allotted a generous annual immigration quota17.756 places. Ireland did not ask for this quota. and did not use many of the available places. Prior to 1965. Irish immigration averaged about 7.000 yearly. The provisions of the 1965 act. while generally doing a service by abolishing the old national origins quota system. unintentionally harmed Ireland. We did not know when we passed the act that this would be the result. and we need to act promptly now to remedy this defect. Tables supplied by the State Department in 1965 predicted that the provisions of the 1965 act would cause Irish immigration to level off at about 5.200 a year. But in fact. it has already dropped to less than 2.000. and the State Department now predicts that it will fall to less than 1.000 annually after this July. when the 1965 act is fully in effect. H.R. 16593. which I have cosponsored. does not reimpose a quota for Ireland. or for any other nation. It simply provides that the immigration level from any nation is not to fall below threefourths of its former average rate. if there is a demand for that many places. This will not harm nationalities who were aided by the 1965 preference system. it will simply protect those few countries like Ireland. which were sharply hurt. or which stand to be hurt after July 1. 1968. It Is the responsibility of the Congress to take steps to Insure that we are not discriminating against a country whose sons have done so much for the United States. Let us act to pass H.R. 16593.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. a letter to the editor published in the current Issue of Fortune magazine puts the economic plight of the American farmer in cold. blunt terms which serve to clear away much of the reckless rhetoric of Secretary Freeman and other apologists for the failure of the KennedyJohnson farm policies. The letter Is written by J. V. G. Forbes. a member of the faculty in history at Blackburn College in Carlinville. Ill. It is in response to a Fortune editorial which was critical of the $3 billion a year in agricultural subsidies. Mr. Forbes. with careful documentation. points out that the most recent figures indicate the value of agricultures productive assets is roughly equal to half the current assets of all U.S. corporations. Allowing a 5percent return on capital investment. Mr. Forbes calculates that the return to the farmer for his management and labor was only 1.4 percent. or about $27.50 a week for each of the Nations farmers. Much attention has been paid in recent months. Mr. President. to the Governments parity ratio which now stands at 74. This figure is based on a complicated computation using the 191014 prices as a basis. A parity ratio of 74 is bad enough. especially when it is recalled that during the Eisenhower years it averaged 84.5. But Mr. Forbes calculates that last year the true parity ratio was only 44.5. using 1948 to 1950 as the base of 100. In summary. Mr. Forbes writes: We have debased the prime tenth of our wealth. the most vigorous generator of the Nations income. the stablest part of our system. It is now to be supposed that there has been no hurt to the whole body? I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Forbes excellent analysis be printed in the Extensions of Remarks.",

For the past 6 years. many of his colleagues have listened with keen interest to his many constructive discussions. Senator MCGOVERN. while ably representing South Dakota. has also dedicated himself to speaking for all Americans. His fine work. prior to coming to the Senate. as special assistant to President Kennedy and serving as director of food for peace. illustrates this fact. His record as a Member of the House of Representatives further attests to his dedication as a public servant. Courage combined with competence describes his career. I salute Senator GEORGE S. McGOVERN and am confident that the citizens of South Dakota again will exercise wise judgment and will return him to the Senate for a second term. An interesting article by Bruce M.

Considering the economic impact that such a move would make. it is indeed essential that the research community. which would receive the heaviest blow in terms of depletion. take part in the decislonmaking process. If such a phaseout is imminent. it is my hope that Idaho will be allowed to take part in the decision with alternative approaches thoroughly considered. It is my hope that Idaho and our neighboring States might develop a cooperative plan to take over this facility for the furtherance of nuclear science studies. To develop such a plan will require more time than is presently indicated. For this reason I hope that no precipitate action will be taken until alternate uses can be fully explored. An editorial entitled \"The MTR Question.\" published in the March 24. 1968. issue of the Idaho Falls PostRegister. provides an apt and lucid discussion of this problem.

To most people the Presidents decision came as a big surprise. But those who have been close to him felt that he was heavily burdened with problems that seemed insoluble.

    "speech": "Mr. President. a recent report from the Farmer Cooperative Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that my State of Minnesota is still leading all other States in the Nation in the number of farmer cooperatives and in number of memberships. Coops headquartered in Minnesota are doing a total net business of more than $1 billion a year. which puts them second only to California in volume of business. That amount includes regional business by farmers in other States. Conversely. it does not include business which Minnesota farmers do with regional cooperatives headquartered in other States. This billiondollar figure is only one measure of cooperative activity in Minnesota. Another measure is in terms of human endeavor. For these cooperatives represent the combined achievement of farmers working together through some 1.000 cooperatives to market their products. buy supplies. and provide other services for themselves. All these coops have boards of directors which plan and guide operations of the cooperatives on behalf of the farmers they represent. These men are helping the farmermember in Minnesota hold his own in a period of price squeeze which results from rising production costs. Minnesota farmers have. however. made some inroads against the price squeeze. They. as the record shows. are the Nations most active farmers in joining together to do all they can to improve their own conditions. One cooperative provides a good example of the importance of farmer coops to the States economy. Farmers Union Grain Terminal AssociationGTAheadquartered at St. Paul.

For too many years now we have kept intelligent. sensitive. and mature young people out of the voting booths by clinging to a series of laws. which are unjust and outmoded. Americas youth deserve the chance. not only to be heard in debate. but to voice their convictions by voting for the candidate of their choice. This is a fundamental right in democracy. a right for which many 18- to 21yearolds are now fighting in Vietnam. I do not think we can ask our young people to lay down their lives for their country on the one hand. and deny them the right to vote on the other. We cannot tell them that they are men enough to fight our wars. but too immature to make a judgment about who is the best candidate in an election. I have unbounded confidence in the future of America. I have confidence because we are producing the best informed and most matured group of young people in our history. These youngsters are proving in countless ways that they are mature and wise. To deny them the right to vote is. in my view. a great miscarriage of justice. President Johnson has now shown us the way to eliminate this barrier between what is right and necessary. and what is wrong but stubbornly perpetuated. So. Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker. as to why this is extended this long. in view of the expected new administration and in view of the new Congress coming into effect. and finally in view of the fact that the production cost plus the delivery cost equals the total of costs. We cannot. as a Nation. go ahead using the taxpayers money forever in a subsidy program that averages more than 50 percentin fact. from 49.6percent subsidy up to 55percent subsidyforever. without any protective tariff and without getting to the basic cause of our cost of production being over that of other nations who also build ships. It seems to me what we need is more automation in our shipbuilding yards. lessened production costs. more protection. and more concentration of industry and less subsidy from the taxpayers purse. Perhaps we are approaching this yearinandyearout request on the Consent Calendar by unanimous consent of all who participate. on the wrong basis.

But in our new program. the new program that we are now working on. we expect to be able to report a bill out from the full committee and get it onto the floor of the House for discussion. We plan to provide for pay in subsidies direct to the shipyards and we hope that by this new legislation we will eliminate some of the subsidy or reduce it at least. And. Mr. Speaker. in the next session of Congress. if we are fortunate enough to come back. we shall go over the overall subsidy question to shipping. and the overall subsidy as to the rates which are given as subsidies to the shipbuilding industry. In addition our opinion is that we ought to get to the study of this problem which is commonly referred to as double subsidy. We will. of course. go into that in the next Congress. So we felt that we should try to get out this legislation which would be helpful in many ways to cut some of these socalled evils of the subsidy. Existing law on this particular point expired as of June 30. 1968. We should extend it now so as not to lose continuity while we are going into the broader question of overall policy.",

I would further point out to the distinguished gentleman from Missouri that it should be noted that the administrations proposed bill also extends the construction subsidy ceiling at 55 percent for the next 2 years. until June 30. 1970. rather than just extending it for the period of 1 year on the subsidy program. but have the period of 1 year for a planning program.",

In March of this year we were privileged to host in America a distinguished delegation from Somalia led by Prime Minister Mohamed Ibrahim Egal.

Somalis and Americans believe in democratic government. in the importance of the individual man. in freedom under law for all. and in a Supreme Being over all our affairs. In the past year Somalia has followed policies initiated by President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke and Prime Minister Egal which are an inspiration to us all. Dedicated to progress in peace. Somalia in cooperation with neighboring Ethiopia and Kenya has worked to improve the wellbeing of all peoples in its part of the world. The success of these neighbors working together gives hope to other leaders of nations vexed by similar inherited problems. They have shown that men of good will by patient effort and mutual respect can make this a better world.

Because we do not send dollars abroad but the materials and equipmentproducts of our labor nd industrywhich the developing countries can immediately use.

Prussia and Russia. proclaimed Its Constitution after the reformminded King Stanislas read to the Diet the new law of the land. Poland was one of the first of the European nations to realize the blessings of the equality and liberty that sprang from the revolutions of France and the United States. The Poles were farsighted and knew that their nation should and would be a leader in the granting of freedom for the peoples of the world. Poland had long been subjected to the domination of stronger nations and therefore knew the value of liberty. But the new Constitution of Poland and the new vigor of the freedomloving Polish people was shortlived. Authoritarian rulers in Eastern Europe could not abide a democracy in their midst because they feared that the ideas of liberty would spread to their own peoples and inspire demands for freedom. Ru~sia was the first to move against Poland. followed by the Prussians and the Austrians. who divided the country of Poland among themselves and ended democracy in the land. The Constitution of 1791 was erased. but the remembrance of freedom could never be removed from the hearts of the Polish peoples. Poland and the free world await the day when once again the modern version of the Constitution will again be proclaimed and the Polish nation can number themselves among the free nations of the world. On the anniversary of Polish Constitution Day. we extend our congratulations to the friends of free Poland and reaffirm our conviction that democracy has not been permanently extinguished in that brave land.",

It is indeed appropriate for us in the Congress of the United States. as Representatives of the people. to pause in recognition and commemoration of this great event. The Polish Constitution. drafted in 1791. is an outstanding document and stands today as one of the guiding lights of European democracy. Many of the principles of a free society that we in the West hold true today can be found embodied in this great proclamation. It still stands today. 177 years later. as a milestone in the struggle of mankind to establish representative and democratic governments. The Polish Constitution upholds the sovereign power and will of the people. grants absolute religious toleration. and guarantees the full protection of law and equal justice for all. Hundreds of thousands of Americans of Polish descent throughout the United States. over 30.000 of whom reside in my own Seventh Congressional District of Illinois. will pause to observe this significant occasion. for the Polish Constitution is a vital symbol of assurance that one day Poland will again achieve complete freedom and independence. My PolishAmerican colleagues in the Congress have contributed much toward sustaining the hope fora Poland free from Communist bondage. and I commend them for their dedication to this just cause as well as for the outstanding patriotic service they have rendered to America It gives me great pleasure to join my distinguished PolishAmerican colleagues in the Congress.

He was one of the first men that I came to know well after I came to Congress in 1949. It did not take long for me to learn that he was a great man and an outstanding Christian gentleman. We were able to be together on the golf course quite frequently and. as our distinguished majority leader has stated. for one who was so frugal in the use of Federal funds. no one could have been more generous with his own personal funds. Certainly he never left anyone in doubt as to where he stood on issues. He demonstrated unusual political courage and he stood by his position regardless of the consequences. I remember on one occasion that he was opposed to a certain bill and the late former Representative from New York. Vito Mareantonio. was also opposed to the bill. although for entirely different reasons. Mr. Marcantonio delivered a very strong speech against the bill. giving reasons for his opposition that were completely foreign to Bob Richs line of thinking. The Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House next recognized the gentleman from Pennsylvania to speak in opposition to the bill. It was not an easy thing for him to follow Mr. Marcantonio and also speak against the bill. but I recall now how dignified he looked and the quiet that came over the Chamber as he walked down the center aisle to the well to address the House. You could just feel the respect that Members of all political philosophies had for this great American. because they knew the courage it took for him to join with Mr. Marcantonio on any bill. and they honored him for that courage. It was beside the point that the bill passed. The facts were that Bob Rich characteristically kept his conscience clear and let the membership know how he felt and why.

In this 90th Congress the Democrats have a majority of 3 to 2 in the House and 2 to 1 in the Senate. Throughout this Democrat 90th Congress. both last session and this second session. the Republican minority has courageously sponsored and consistently supported as a team a series of amendments to authorization and appropriation bills for specific reductions in President Johnsons budget. In this determined economy effort our Republican minority has received only opposition from the administration and the Democrat majority leadership. When President Johnson called both the House Republican and Democrat leadership to the White House on April 3 we met with him and his advisers on fiscal and monetary affairs. we hoped that the President was then initiating a bipartisan program in a meaningful effort to put the countrys fiscal house in order. In vain we hoped that a program would be worked out on a bipartisan basis for decreasing expenditures and increasing taxes to such an extent necessary to place the country on a sound fiscal basis. Now is the time when the President himself should set aside all partisanship. stand up as President of all the people. and exercise the bold national leadership as befits the Office of President of the United States in meeting the grave fiscal and monetary crisis confronting the Nation.

We in this Chamber will be moving forward with our deliberations bearing in mind the temper of the Nation and the degree of public response to the Presidents appeal for prompt action. I am greatly encouraged. as most of us are. with the reports of strong support for the Presidents proposals which have already been received from one of the most important of all segments of our publicprivate industry. This indeed is most encouraging. Industry has a real stake In the cities. When we think of the vast changes in our skylines. in our new expressways and other great construction projects. we are forced to realize that these changes have been wrought directly or indirectly by the growth of industry and the changing patterns of our private enterprise system. Say what you will about the movement of plants to the suburbs. or about new kinds of service industries. there is no doubt that nearly all business growth takes place In and around our cities. If there is a crisis in our cities. then our business executives knowor at least are coming fast to knowthat their own corporations have a crisis. too. As Fortune magazine recently pointed out. business and the Negro and the city have a common cause in wiping out the root causes of urban decline. blight. joblessness. crime. and other ills. Quoting Fortune: American business. busily generating change. has in the main stood apart from the responsibilities--and the opportunitiesof coping with the community needs that arise from change.... The business attitude toward the problems of the city is shifting. The Presidents message on the cities offers hope for increasing the opportunity for participation of private enterprise. Most important it contains a proposal that Congress authorize privately funded partnerships to bring increased private capital to bear on urban problems. particularly the problem of lowincome housing. Also by enlisting business skills and putting them to work in our cities. we can begin with confidence the massive task that lies ahead.

For the first time in our history we are now giving our cities a real opportunity to combat their slums and blight in the only manner in which they can successfully be eliminatedby locally developed and executed programs. Model cities enable cities to coordinate all of their local resources. both public and private. with State and Federal aids. in a combined. really massive assault on all problems of slum living: substandard housing and education. poor health. unemployment. and illiteracy. The programs are going to develop from the local communities upward and not from Washington downward. as has been the case too often in the past. In other words. the residents of the slums themselves. are going to work together with city. State. and Federal officials. in determining what can be done about the conditions of their neighborhoods. and how it can be accomplished most speedily and efficiently. In the first round of approvals. 63 cities. large and small. were approved for model cities planning grants. Some 4 million people live in the model city neighborhoods of these cities. They suffer more from poverty. unemployment. and housing than the average American. But they are determined to do something about their plight. Can we afford to let them down?

This timetested Federallocal program. authorized in 1949. has proved its worth over the years. Today. it is being used in more than 900 large and small communities in 48 States. the District of Columbia. Puerto Rico. the Virgin Islands. and Guam. In addition to the impressive effects of this program on the physical rebuilding of our cities. it has generated an impressive financial record. Since 1949. $7 billion in urban grants have been authorized. For each Federal dollar. however. private enterprise has invested about $41/. Furthermore. the real estate tax return from completed projects is about 41/2 times the tax return prior to redevelopment. Over the years urban renewal has meant the rebuilding and revitalization of many downtown areas in the Nations cities. It has resulted in the restoration of industrial and commercial complexes. It has brought about the public and private construction of new housing. as well as the rehabilitation of usable housing for low- and moderateincome families. Finally. it has rejuvenated many ailing neighborhoods and put them on the road to good health. We have found that urban renewal has a contagious effect. When a blighted neighborhood is improved. the positive effects are felt by adjoining areas. and the spirit of improvement spreads. Today. there is a new face on urban renewal. Its top priority mission is to help the poor through improved housing and expanded job opportunities. I sincerely believe that the urban renewal program must be expanded as recommended by President Johnson. if we are to attain our national housing goals of \"a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.\"",

One of the outstanding parts of the message to me is that dealing with the model cities programs. I have been a partisan on the side of model cities ever since it was first introduced 2 years ago. I am still an enthusiastic supporter of model cities. and believe that the Presidents request for $1 billion is really a minimum request. The potentialities of model cities is enormous. Imagine. if the $1 billion is approved we will have. within a couple of years. 130 or more local laboratories of experimentation in ways to solve the problems of slum living. Better than that. the people in charge of the experimentation will be those actually involved in the experiments. The people living in the slum areas where model cities techniques are to be created and tried will be responsible for the planning and execution of the programs designed to improve their living conditions. This is the logical end of the long. long road we have been traveling for three decades. For 30 years we have been trying one program after another to cure the slums. to help the people forced to live there. Some worked partially. others not at all. Now. instead of trying to find the answers ourselves. we are asking the people in the cities themselveslocal public officials and residents aliketo come up with answers. Will they? Maybe yes. maybe no. Probably some of both. But well never know unless we give them the chance. The $1 billion requested by President Johnson will give them the chance. And I am going to do my best to see they get it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as far as I am concerned. the Presidents message on cities is outstanding for one main reasonits request for $1 billion for model cities. This Is the kind of legislation the Nation has been waiting for ever since passage of the Housing Act of 1937. For 30 years we in the United States have been waiting for the kind of housing and urban development bill that would encompass all the problems of urban poverty. not just housing. not just clearance. not Just healthbut all of these and more. Now. for the first time. we have that kind of legislation. If we fall to give President Johnson the kind of support he has requested we fall the people of the United States. More than that. we make a mockery of the model cities legislation we have already passed. and the appropriationsmodest though they arethat we have approved. Many of us have worked hard and long to make model cities legislation come true. and we feel that the moment of truth is here. Model cities is the comprehensive kind of legislation that promises to do the whole job. not just a bit or piece. It gives the cities the utmost flexibility in planning and in carrying out those plans. It gives a role to the people who live in the slum areas they have never had before. a chance to plan their own futures. Maybe they will succeed. maybe they will fail. but It will be their own failures or successes. not ones thrust upon them from above or below. Personally. I am convinced that when the people in our local communities get a chance to determine their own environments. their own needs for better schools. housing. and Jobs. they will succeed beyond all our expectations. They deserve that chance. And model cities gives it to them. That is why I say. support President Johnsons message.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. inadequate housing is one of the Nations greatest problems. The President. in his message read to us today. puts this at the top of his legislative list. and I agree. No major city in America has eliminated its bad housing. Over 41/2 million urban families live in structures of such disrepair as to violate decent standards. To meet the challenge of the future we need to provide at least 50 percent more housing annually than has been built in any year in the past. We do not provide sufficient low- and moderateincome housing. of adequate quality. at a reasonable price. This is at the heart of our urban problem. For substandard housing leads to the development of widespread slum areas. Inadequate and insufficient housing contributes to the hopelessness of the ghetto resident. it is a factor in high rates of crime. delinquency. and disease. Largely inadequate housing is a characteristic of the Harlems. Watts. and other slums of cities large and small. Housing is central to all of our hopes for remaking the urban areas. Unless there is better housing available to those who are not now adequately housed. we will be hampered in our efforts to solve the problems of employment. education. and all the other problems which affect the ghetto. I will go further and say that I feel there is less likelihood of making an impact on any of our urban problems unless at the same time the housing choices in this Nation are also expanded and equalized. We must provide an adequate supply of decent housing for lowincome people unable to pay the full cost of housing in the private market. With the Presidents proposed program we can hope to do so. I urge my colleagues to support the campaign for moreand betterhousing. This is a nonpartisan issue. It was a Republican. the late Senator Robert A. Taft. who led the fight for slum replacement. We must continue that fight.",

Time was only a few years ago when private was private and public was public. and never the twain could meet. We deliberately maintained walls and gaps between private and public enterprise in dealing with our housing and urban problems. Thank heaven we have changed that. And I am glad to see the heavy stress that President Johnson in his message on the cities. has placed on the role of the private sector in meeting public needs. and role of public action to support private progress. We need them both and we need them working closely together. Look at the changes that have occurred: Private developers are now initiating. building. and in some cases even managing lowrent public housing. Public funds. through subsidies and lowinterest rates. are making it possible for low- and moderateincome families to live in privately owned rental housing. Private funds. along with public money. are now going into new methods and materials. Into research. and into practical demonstrations to lower cost housing. for efficient means of rehabilitation. for better design. for planning and facilitiesto bring better housing to more people and improve the urban environment. We now find private and public joining together to produce apartment units at lower cost. and to improve housing without displacing people. We must keep the public financing of these joint ventures moving ahead. And President Johnson has made such a proposalauthorization for the formation of privately funded partnerships. The express purpose of these partnerships will be to join private capital with business skills to help close the lowincome housing gap. It is a worthwhile proposal and one which merits the enthusiastic support by Congress.",

MINISH. who represents the l1th Congressional District of New Jersey with dignity and honor. JOE MINISH was a prime factor in obtaining recently more modern and comfortable air transportation between Washington and Newark. N.J. He fought for this modern mode of transportation for some time. The main passenger carrying line. Eastern Airlines. provided this profitable shuttle service to its patrons witl. mostly early model equipment. until JOE MINISH took upon himself to stir Lhis airline into action to provide better faciilties and plane accommodations. Several days ago we saw the culmination of his efforts when Eastern Airlines announced that certain flights between our Capital City of Washington and Newark had been replaced by jetplanes which will provide faster. safer. and more comfortable service between these two points. Mr. Speaker. by his persistent and vigorous actions. Congressman JOSEPH MINISH not only served his own New Jersey constituents. but also aided the New Yorkbound traveler who uses Newark as his departure or arrival point. He should have the gratitude of all the people who use the NewarkWashington terminals. for they are now enjoying faster. quieter. and safer service. But this is typical of Congressman MINISH. for he is a person who gets things done. He has shown this in the present instance and many times in the past in other matters. He is a valuable Member of this House and a definite asset to his congressional district. I am pleased to number him as one of the great legislators in this distinguished House and one of my most helpful colleagues. In tackling this problem of modem. safe. and rapid plane travel between our Nations Capital and the Newark terminal. Congressman MINISn had to convince a powerful public carrier of the necessity of a move for better plane travel. This was not an easy task. but with perseverance and constant watchfulness over progress in this respect. Congressman MINISH finally won out. For his effort we should express our deepest thanks.",

Yesterday a majority of the members of the House District Committee. lead by our chairman. introduced legislation to provide an elected 11member board. With everybody united behind this proposal. I am hopeful it can be speedily adopted so that next year the citizens of Washington can elect their school board members. The District of Columbia public schools are not all that we would like them to be. But there is hope that they will be significantly improved in the near future if certain steps are taken. First. the Congress must provide additional money for the schools. and provide it before the school year begins so that it can be used most effectively. Second. the present school board must be able to choose and attract a new superintendent who will change some of the outmoded practices of the District of Columbia schools. Finally. the needed capstone is an elected school board. so that each family is given the basic right to be represented in the policymaking body that controls the direction and progress of their schools. If these three steps are taken we can begin the journey toward the goal of the District of Columbia public schools becoming a model for the rest of the Nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the bill which the Committee on Commerce unanimously reported on August 14 represents a conviction that a major national effort is required to reduce the present shameful loss of life and property resulting from fires. Hearings before the Consumer Subcommittee clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of present efforts to protect the American public from the ravages of fire. The best estimates available indicate that in 1965. fire in the United States caused 12.100 deaths and property damage amounting to $1.741.400.000or $8.98 for every man. woman. and child. The committee was particularly disturbed by evidence that among the major nations of the world. the United States has the highest per capita death rate from fires. twice that of Canada. four times that of the United Kingdom. and. remarkably. 61/2 times that of Japan. While our much higher per capita death rate may reflect the hazards that accompany our higher standard of living. this merely indicates that we must put forth greater safety efforts as our living standards rise. if we are to eliminate excessive loss of life to fire. Over the past 5 years. the best private estimate of fire deaths from all causes remained relatively constant. Over the same period the estimated per capita number of fires in the United States has increased 9 percent and the estimated per capita property damage has increased 4 percent. Our 1965 estimated per capita property damages-$8.98contrasts with $6.85 for Canada. Japan. with a population of about onehalf that of the United States. has a per capita loss of only $1.32 and its total number of fires in 1965 is about onefortieth of the number that occurred in the United States. The hearings before the Consumer Subcommittee pinpointed the deficiencies and needs in our present fire safety and protection programs.",

From my own background with volunteer fire companies. as well as my experience as a public official in the State of Delaware.

Coming from a State in which there is only one paid fire company and 62 volunteer fire companies.

My own State. and others as well. are indeed fortunate to hayr. the type of men and women who will devote many hours of their time in the interests of protecting the lives and property of their neighbors. I am sure that volunteer fire companies such as those in Delaware. already embodied with a spirit of public service and dedication to effective firefighting. will be eager to take advantage of the help the Secretary of Commerce will be able to give in support of programs involving investigation of fires. research. public education. education and training programs. and other steps to make our firefighting efforts at all levels more effective. It seems to me that with our population growing as rapidly as it is. and with new materials and construction methods being tried all the time. it is especially important that firefighters have the most uptodate knowledge possible on how best to fight the fires they encounter.

At that time none had responded to the inquiry in my letter. and I so stated in the RECORD. Yesterday afternoon. however. a response from Mr. Julian Goodman. president of NBC. was received in my office. I appreciate the fact that Mr. Goodman responded for NBC. My letter to the presidents of the national TV networks observed that the electronic media were engaged in a concerted crusade of railing against guns while at the same time they were glamorizing and glorifying the smoking of cigarettes. especially by youth. I asked the presidents of NBC. CBS. and ABC to explain the rationale which permitted them to rail at guns yet glorify cigarette smoking when the evidence is clear that cigarette smoking shortens more lives. causes more damage and destruction. and costs more money than guns. Mr. Goodman answered. but his reply was not responsive. No response whatsoever was made to my specific Inquiry. The motivation of the news. commentary. documentary. and advertising policy of NBC seems to be pecuniary profitpure and simple. Slow death. human agony. damage. destruction. and costs are not considerations which form the basis of the national media policy. ethics. or public service when profit is involved.",

As I have Indicated on previous occasions. our citizens view the seizure of an American naval vessel on the high seas as an act of war. Not in 100 years has our flag been forcibly lowered on a U.S. Navy ship. The wave of public indignation Is growing. and hopefully this will impress on the President the necessity of taking strong action. Our people have listened for 6 long years to the arguments for defending South Vietnam. and before that South Korea. and before that Berlin. They are now tired of waiting for a cry to defend our own men in our own ship. It is time to stand up for America. The President should direct the Secretary of State to demand the immediate release of our ship and men. and alert the Secretary of Defense to back up that demand. The United States stands guard around the world protecting other nations and other peoples. It is time we take care of our own interests and our own citizens. A cartoon making the rounds says. \"Remember the Alamo. Remember the Maine. Remember Pearl Harbor. Forget the Pueblo?\" Well. the American people will not forget the Pueblo.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today joining with the entire Minnesota congressional delegation in introducing a bill to create the Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota. Located in one of the most beautiful areas of our Nation. it is one of the few expanses of America that remains in essentially its natural. unspoiled condition. To create such a national park would be to preserve this area for all Americans. present and future. It would not only be preserved for its esthetic value. but would provide needed additional recreational facilities for a rapidly growing U.S. population. This proposal would create a national park composed of 211.000 acres including 139.000 acres of land and 72.000 acres of water. Year round recreational use would be maintained. ranging from unlimited free use of park waters for boating in the summer to the use of snowmobile trails during Minnesotas invigorating winter season. Mr. Speaker. we have taken special pains to hammer out a bill that would serve the best interests of the people now living in the area of the proposed park as well as the future interests of all Americans. Attention was paid to minimizing any adverse effects upon cabin owners. resorts. and other businesses dependent upon the park area for their livelihood. and the wood products and paper industry that uses the timber. Most of the resort. commercial. and private cabin properties are exempt from Federal acquisition. and most of the parks access points would be through existing resorts. giving private enterprise a boost while providing free access to the park by the public. Even the resorts subject to acquisition could continue to operate on a concession basis. and private property owners would not only be paid a fair market value for their holdings. but would retain the right of use and occupancy of the property throughout their lifetimes. This bill provides for reimbursement to counties faced with a tax loss. and further provideg for land exchanges between private owners. the State. and the Federal Government to keep county tax bases and commercially used timber holdings near their present levels. I believe the addition of Voyageurs to our national park system will bring the greatest possible benefit to the area affected and the entire Nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join with all other members of the Minnesota congressional delegation in introducing today legislation to establish a Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota. This 211.000acre park encompasses some of the most scenic and historical water and land in the entire United States. Stretching along the Canadian border. the area is a magnificent panorama of lakes and streams. cliffs. islands. beaches. in a truly wilderness setting. The park area. consisting of 139.000 acres of land and 72.000 acres of water. would be a unique recreational area providing yeararound facilities for camping. fishing. boating. snowmobiling. hiking. nature study. skating. crosscountry skiing and other means of outdoor relaxation. The proposed national park embraces one of the most important segments of 18th- and 19thcentury exploration in North America. As the National Park Service said in a recent study: The voyageurs travels left one decisive imprint on the map of North America. At one time or another France. England. and the United States had claimed the QueticoSuperior region. When the WebsterAshburton Treaty of 1842 firmly established the international boundary. it drew the line along the Pigeon River route from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods. which is defined as the \"customary waterway\" of the voyageur. Voyageurs National Park will create for the visitor the setting which the voyagers of old traveled. It is an exciting proposal and I am most hopeful that all members of Congress will thoroughly acquaint themselves with it during the course of our congressional deliberations.",

Moreover. the administration has expressed willingness. in the editorials words. to \"take very seriously any move by the newly elected South Vietnamese Government intended to bring about a bombing pause as a possible preliminary to negotiation with Hanoi.\" American critics of our Vietnam policy overlook the fact that two sides are needed to negotiate a peace.

I include the Hartford Times editorial. dated September 11. 1967. in the RECORD as continuing evidence of the administrations commitment to peace: MR. :usKs MOVE If there has been doubt that the United .States would accept the sincere help of any agency to negotiate peace in Vietnam. It must be measured against Secretary of State Rusks latest action. Mr. Rusk said that this nation would welcome the initiative of the UN to make any contribution toward peace. And he also stated that the United States would certainly take very seriously any move by the newly elected South Vietnamese government intended to bring about a bombing pause as a possible preliminary to negotiation with Hanoi.

Recently a young constituent of mine. a sergeant in the U.S. Army. lost one leg in Vietnam and his other leg was pretty well shot up by shrapnel. He was at Brooke Army General Hospital. and received a 30day medical leave to go home. His brother picked him up in a wheelchair. and when the sergeant got in the car. his brother folded up the chair and drove off. When they reached Houston. they received an urgent telephone call that his leave had been canceled because he had carried off the wheelchair. After inquiry from my office. they said: Well. we will go ahead and let him have his leave. but the family must ship the wheelchair back to San Antonio. The Surgeon Generals office here said: We have only 13 wheelchairs and we have 50 amputees in that hospital section. Do you know that we have over 6.000 wheelchairs in storage. and all they needed to do was to request an additional shipment? Today I am demanding a full investigation. not only of the operation of Brooke. but of every other hospital we have. It is utterly ridiculous when a legless or crippled veteran home on medical leave cannot have the use of a wheelchair. I sent the following telegram to Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara. asking for a full and complete investigation: Hon. ROBERT S. McNAMARA. Secretary of Defense. The Pentagon. Washington. D.C.: I urge your immediate investigation into operation of service hospitals serving our Vietnam casualties to see they are fully equipped to provide ultimate in care and service. On August 29. officials at Brooke Army Hospital. Fort Sam Houston. Texas. cancelled medical leave for my constituent as punishment for carrying home inadvertently one of the hospitals wheelchairs. I was advised by surgeon generals office here the hospital ward 43A has 13 wheelchairs to serve 50 amputees. Defense Supply Agency advises me it has in storage 6.144 new wheelchairs. This is a ridiculous situation. and I ask your immediate action to see it is corrected and that legless veterans are provided wheelchairs for leave. if they so desire. Respectfully.",

Several of us in the U.S. Congress have introduced legislation which urge that the President instruct our U.N. Ambassador to oppose this idea.

The best I have been able to find out is that rather than support the Malta resolution. the United States will urge an extensive study of the proposal. looking toward guidelines to establish a basis of development of the resources under the sea. In other words. it is clear that the United States is not intending to oppose this resolution and stand on article I of the 1958 Geneva Convention which already has established ownership of coastal states in their Continental Shelves and also. mark this. ownership of the resources beyond to whatever depth a nation could develop those resources. In other words. the sovereignty of the seabed .adjacent to each coastal nation under international agreement. approved by members of the United Nations. is already vested in each adjacent coastal nation.

And although the GAO itself would not conduct these audits. they will be performed under ground rules laid out by the GAO and they will be reviewed and reported on by the GAO. These audits will not be directed solely to the Social Progress Trust Fund but to all internal management procedures of the Bank including those governing funds contributed by foreign nations.

Today I have received information to indicate that young Mr. Yarb6rough. whose legal experience appears mainly confined to work in his fathers office. is certainly not the most qualified individual available for service on the Commission. Indeed. he appears to have no special background in the complicated laws that pertain to Indian claims or to the unique problems of the American Indian. Mr. Speaker.

As under present law. the survivor would have to remarry after the age of 60 to be eligible for these continued benefits.

It should be preserved as a biological resource. In the future scientists may well be put to it to reconstruct genetic combinations which exist today in such pure strains from the past. A whole biological story remains to be told here. waiting for the everincreasing skills of scientists to be able to interpret. What a catastrophe if the story were to be destroyed before its meaning could be unravelled. the code uninterpreted before it is lost. I have been assured by The President that every consideration will be given to the Condor and its continued preservation in the studies being conducted by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife and the Bureau of Reclamation In cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game and other conservation agencies and organizations. I concur with the \"Management and Research Plan for the California Condor\" of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife (July 1965) which recommends a delay of 2 years for the accumulation of additional information prior to considering authorization of the Topatopa Dam. From the purely scientific point of view. I feel that the preservation of the California Condor Is of utmost importance. and I hope that neither the sentiment of bird lovers nor commercial interests will interfere with the application of appropriate. scientifically based management measures to enhance the continued existence of the species.

Most of us are well acquainted with the great nation building programs this country has engaged in after the shooting has stopped.

This countrys international commitments and the nature of the threats to world peace and the technical advances of communication and transportation have involved new ways of employing our military forces and government employees as instruments of national policy. In like manner. this countrys private business and private citizen groups have found that the manner in which they conduct their activities reflects upon the image of the United States. Indeed. action of the private sector is a potent force for enhancing or undermining the U.S. policy and position.

If the Senator will turn to page 109. lines 14 and 15. it will be seen that a qualification for a rehabilitation loan. as there set forth. Is that \"the property is residential and owner occupied.\" One of the grave problems in the big cities in my State. such as New York City. Buffalo. Syracuse. and others. as examples. relates to the structures which have been condemned or abandoned. but are capable of rehabilitation. However. inasmuch as the city has either title or possession. obviously the buildings are not \"owner occupied.\" We were going to endeavor to amend the section to provide for that situation. The Senator from Alabama . the chairman of the committee. felt that there might be too many claims and that too many municipalities would attempt to come In. Again. I wish to do everything I can to go along with the chairman and with everything he wants in this matter. because he has been a great benefactor of housing. Another way in which this problem is approachable under the law without incurring the problem the Senator from Alabama is concerned about is under sections 235 and 236. Under those sections the local agency conceivably could get a loan in order to rehabilitate such vacant buildings for the purpose of selling or renting them in conformity with the requirement of the sections. So If a municipality really had the enterprise to move in a fullscale effort to do something with such buildings. it could proceed under sections 235 and 236. I wish to ask the manager of the bill if he would agree with that construction of a pattern. in which a municipality which was really serious and wanted to do something could bring itself under the law.",

Among the purposes is the establishment of temporary public playgrounds on vacant land within the area. One of the real and critical problems is that during the summer one of the greatest things that can be done in a slum or a ghetto is to provide a swimming pool or a place to swim. It need be only a canvas tank. or even a hydrant. but at least it would be something. It relates to the unique need of the steaming ghettos during that time of the year. Does the Senator see anything In the discretion of the Secretary which would exclude that kind of facility for recreation?

This proposal is not something new which was developed here in the last day or two. or in the last month or two. The Senator from Florida held hearings on this problem over a year ago. in April of 1967. My own Subcommittee on Small Business held hearings on similar legislation last fall. I see in the Chamber the junior Senator from Illinois. who serves on the Subcommittee on Small Business. The Senator from Pennsylvania . the Senator from New York . and the Senator from Florida . all of us found a pressing need to do something in this area. It started originally. as the Senator from Alabama said. with the \"mom and pop\" type store. the small neighborhood business. Then we found it was involved with the riot problem. I do not see this title as a big city bill. I do not see it as an attempt to take the money of rural taxpayers and rebuild the ghettos. In my small but great State of New Hampshire we have had two riots in the last few years. one of serious proportions at Hampton Beach. This was brought out in the hearings. This program is absolutely essential to the small bakery shop. the small food store. and the other little businesses which find themselves without any ability to obtain any insurance. Even where insurance is available. the rates are so intolerably high that they cannot afford it. and so they crumble away. They leave the ghetto. which becomes a more hopeless part of the community without them. Mr. President. there is a strong desire among the members of the committee to retain this part of the bill.",

It reads as follows: The facts developed during the various hearings point out the insurance crisis in our cities. The deterioration of many inner city areas is threatening the economic and social health of the cities as a whole. This deterioration has. in too many cases. caused the owners of wellmaintained properties and businesses to be unable to obtain adequate property insurance against fire. crime. and other perils because of the general location of the property in a highrisk area or because of its proximity to dilapidated or hazardous structures. In other words. here is a risk against which the resources of the private insurance companies are Inadequate. I wish to point out that. with respect to the private power companies of this country and the construction of nuclear powerplants. private insurance was similarly inadequate and so Congress has provided Governmentsubsidized insurance to protect the private power companies against a risk which the private insurance industry is unable to cover. So the private power companies. with the help of Governmentsupported insurance. are protected and given insurance at a fraction of the cost they would have to pay to private insurance companies. Now. Mr. President. if it is appropriate for us to provide this kind of protection for an industry with such resources as the private power industry of this country. it seems to me a perfectly appropriate precedent for the kind of protection we are seeking here for businesses which are essential to the vitality and development of the ghetto areas of our cities.

He said: We note first in our committee. and I think that it is a valid conclusion and I think many people are coming to share it. that the real issue confronting this insurance panel was not one that grew out of the riots as though the riots in our cities had created this problem. but one that was highlighted by these disorders. And the real problem was the unavailability. and it has existed for some years. and shortage of insurance. Governor Hughes continued and said: It is a historic fact. Senator. and I am delighted that you commented on it. Many of us are inclined to believe that all these things occurred just recently. That is not so at all. We have seen over these years our urban centers deteriorate and our structures decay and decline. as the criminal rate grows. and the insurance losses increase. As the loss ratios increase. the desirability of centercity business has decreased until it is most difficult. if not impossible. for the homeowner and the small businessman to obtain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost. or often at any cost.

Wouldnt It really follow that they would be less corrupted not knowing who was sendIng them than they would had they known? Senator MANSFIELD. Well. let me answer your question In a roundabout way. In the first place. I do not think the CIA should ever have been involved in covert activities of this sort. and may I say that the CIA felt and still feels the same way. I am In favor of government subsidies to students to participate in international conferences on the same basis that the State Department subsidizes dance troupes. acting companies. boxers. athletes. singers. and so forth. but that Is done openly and there is no reason why the State Department and the HEW Department both could not do the same thing which the CIA has been doing but shouldnt have been doing and was doing against its desires.",

Of the 30 leading indicators. 19 show a trend. Of the 19 showing a trend only four are favorable. and 15 are unfavorable. Not only does inflation and employment depend on the tailoring of our tax policies and monetary and investment policies to the economic situation. but also the remarkable growth of this Nation that has continued for 6 years and provided unparalleled national strength as well as prosperity. This. too. hangs In the balance.

They argue that it is still early enough to rewrite the script successfully. Housing after all. is begining to respond to easier credit conditions.

As I stated to the committee this morning. the joy of the advocates of the human rights conventions is considerably dampened by the failure to include the Genocide Convention for consideration. The Genocide Convention has languished in some unmarked committee limbo for 18 long years. When President Truman submitted this first great United Nations convention to the Senate for ratification in 1949. only five nations had already ratified. During the intervening period. an additional 64 nations have ratified the Genocide Convention. But the United States is not among them.

The Genocide Convention has as its stated objective the protection of mans most precious rightthe right to live.

I am today introducing five identical bills. cosponsored by 107 other Members of the House from 28 States and from both political parties. to attack hunger and malnutrition wherever they exist in this country. by making possible the extension of the food stamp program into every State and into every city or county wishing to have it. At present. only about onethird of the counties in the United States are able to participate in this \"eat enough\" program to assure adequate diets for lowincome families. Because of the $195.000.000 ceiling on authorized appropriations for the food stamp program in the current fiscal year. hundreds of counties which were certified last December to come Into the program have not been able to do so. Most of them will be able to participate beginning July 1. however. when the authorization ceiling permits $225.000.000 to be appropriated and spent. But that will not be enough to allow a large number of other counties. which also want the food stamp program. to participate under it. And a proposed increase in the ceiling for the 1969 fiscal year to $245.000.000. as provided for in a bill which recently passed the Senate. would not be sufficient. either. to cover these additional areas. Consequently. 108 of us from 29 States have joined to propose eliminating completely the limitation in the present law for 1969 fiscal year appropriations for food stamps. And since no appropriations are now authorized under present law for the food stamp program for the fiscal years after the one ending June 30. 1969. we also propose in this legislation a similar openend appropriation authorization for the 1970. 1971. and 1972 fiscal years. Thus. Congress could appropriate whatever amounts it considered necessary.",

The country mourns another fallen leaderand there is nothing we can say to ease the pain or to explain it away. This madness. this senseless slaughter must be stopped. To that end. the President appointed a bipartisan Commission. made up of distinguished citizens of many walks of life. to study this most urgent problem and to submit recommendations on how to head off future tragedies. The Commission will be headed by Dr. Milton Eisenhower. the highly respected former president of John Hopkins University. We hope and pray that the work of the Commission will be a success. But the President. unlike some others who have spoken out In the past 36 hours. refused to Indict the Nation as a whole for this terrible deed. He said: It would be wrong and selfdeceptive to conclude from this act that our country itself is sick. that it has lost its balance. that it has lost its sense of direction. even its common decency. 200 million Americans did not strike down Robert Kennedy last night any more than they struck down John F. Kennedy in 1963 or Dr. Martin Luther King in April of this year. I agree.

I am disturbed by the failure of the existing farm programs to alleviate conditions and give the farmer a fair return for the time and effort he expends in providing essential products for the consuming public. Also there is a credibility gap in what the administrative spokesmen are telling the people. From firsthand knowledge. I believe that the facts contained in the editorial from the Prairie Farmer tell the true story and dispel the fog that has been created by some spokesmen at the national level who do not know all that is going on. Farmers are a patriotic. hardworking lot. They are industrious and have made heavy investments in land and equipment to carry on their enterprise in the best American tradition. Their plight should be recognized and their problems resolved rather than their being subjected to public misrepresentation for the job they are doing In providing food and fiber under arbitrary Federal controls and restrictions. It will take food to win the peace and feed the hungry at home and abroad. Our farmers have accepted this responsibility in the past and they will do the job again. But they cannot do it efficiently and well under present Federal policies. The editorial follows: WHAT PaowrrS Is HE TALKING ABOUT? Government studies are valuable if they make an honest effort to be objective and include men with varied experiences and points of view. Too often it isnt hard to guess the outcome of a federal study. Too many commissions. like the supreme court. are loaded with administration appointees whose particular persuasion is no secret. Now along comes a private socialaction group which makes the same loaded judgment on hunger and malnutrition which. they say. exists In every part of the UB. including Illinois. Chairman of this board of inquiry into hunger was Walter Reuther. president of the United Auto Workers.

I recall in 1964. when Congressman KIRWAN flew in to Logan. W. Va.. in a small plane. in order to give a campaign speech for me at Logan Memorial Field House. The plane had difficulty negotiating the mountain passes. and landed with considerable difficulty. Then we had to ford the Guyandotte River in a pickup truck to proceed to our destination. But when MIKE KIRWAN arose on the platform and started speaking to his audience of coal miners and their families and friends. he struck an immediate responsive chord because of his own upbringing. and his ability to relate directly to the experiences. hopes. and dreams of his listeners. I have had the honor to appear many times before MIKE KIRWANS subcommittee on behalf of projects of value to the State of West Virginia. Our State owes many debts to MIKE KIRWAN. and there are many monuments in our State in the public works projects he has assisted West Virginia in obtaining. It is a rare privilege to join with my colleagues in saluting this great son of Ohio. MIKE KIRWAN. on his birthday.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my colleagues in complimenting the gentleman from Ohio on his 81St birthday. He has served his State for more than 30 years with diligence and dedication. He has always shown great interest and sympathy for the public works projects in my district. whenever such projects met the required criteria. I have never known MIKE to be vindictive against those who disagreed with him. As chairman of a Subcommittee on Public Works Appropriations. he is in a position to injure members of the opposing party. I recall one of the most important proj eots in my District. which posSessed all of -the necessary criteria. had been authorized some 15 years ago. but was delayed because of the Korean war. and by further planning and study. and the construction of working models for the Dana Point Harbor. The Federal cost was to be in the neighborhood of $5 nllion. with local participation totaling $15 million. The first Federal increment was to be $1 million. and the officials in Orange County were greatly concerned as to whether an appropriation would be made. I discussed the matter with MIKE in early February of that year. and he gave me a commitment that the appropriation would be made. In spite of pressures to the contrary. MIKE KIRWAN kept that commitment. There is an old political axiom which says. never make a political promise. but if you do make one. never break it. MIKE KIRWAN fills the bill. I consider it L distinct privilege and a sincere pleasure to have served in the Congress with such a fine statesman. and I hope he will come out to California and enjoy the sailing in Dana Point Harbor. which will be completed next year.",

This truly remarkable man who. with matchless courage and magnificent wisdom. guided our people through some of the most perilous days in the history of our Republic. will celebrate the day quietly with his beloved Bess. I salute Harry Truman for many battles well fought and for a life well lived. I admire Harry Truman for his invaluable service in behalf of the American people and his unflagging dedication to the great cause of world peace and human dignity. It was Harry Truman who. at the conclusion of the San Francisco Conference in 1945. spoke these prophetic words: Unless we can attain these objective (human rights) for all men and women everywhere . . . we cannot have permanent peace and security. True to his word. President Truman strongly supported the United Nations. and in 1949 submitted the Genocide Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent. President Truman straightforwardly and emphatically urged the Senate to ratify the Convention on Genocide. Now. 18 years and three Presidents later. the Senate has still failed to act. Senate ratification. if anything. is even more urgent in 1967 than it was in 1949. Mr. President. I can think of no more fitting tribute to a great President. nor no more meaningful act by the Senate of the United States on May 8. 1967. than the resolve of this Senate that it will speedily ratify the Convention on Genocide.",

They have given to America not only a strong spirit of national consciousness. but an indomitable sense of courage and independence. In my own State of California. we are particularly proud of our over 11/2 million Mexican American citizens. They represent. in a very real sense. the devotion and love for country which a small and of gallant Mexicans displayed in 862 when they defeated a large foreign rmy on the fifth of May. Each year on this day. the Republic of lexico and Spanishspeaking citizens of (exican descent celebrate this historic ictory of Cinco de Mayo. This battle ymbolizes the overwhelming power of he human spirit over all military odds. In the 1860s. Mexico was a struggling oung nation fighting to retain its inde.endence. European nations. particuarly France under Napoleon III. cast .reedy glances on this new and vibrant ountry. In 1862. 6.000 French soldiers set out rom Veracruz to Mexico City to the ictory they were sure would be theirs. 3ut their confidence was unwarranted. or on May 5. they encountered a small. :ourageous band of Mexican patriots at ?uebla. a strategic city halfway between 7eracruz and Mexico City. The French Army was thrown back and the victory at Puebla became a national legend. The valor of these patriots in the face of superior odds and their heroism led to the creation of Cinco de Mayo as a national holiday for Mexico. The fifth of May commemorates a day upon which courage and love for country triumphed over the threat of a foreign power. The strength. valor. and patriotism of those men has served as an inspiration to the entire world for over. 100 years. It is these same inspiring qualities which Spanishspeaking people of Mexican descent have given to California and America. In honor of those fine citizens and in memory of the brave men who fought so valiantly at Puebla. I take great pleasure in extending greetings and warmest best wishes to the Republic of Mexico and to all Mexican Americans on -this. the 105th anniversary of Cinco de Mayo.",

He spoke with forceful logic which again spelled out the reasons for Americas commitments in South Vietnam. He contrasted the clear and unmistakable difference between the efforts of the United States to help the South Vietnamese to establish a sound and stable government with the brutality and wanton terrorism used as deliberate tools by the Communists in an effort to enforce their will. There are a number of passages which are of particular significance in his wellprepared statement. For instance. he declared: Knowing these thingsknowing the true face of the war. on both sides--I find it difficult to understand the convoluted logic which leads some to condemn this nation for \"immorality\" and to defend terrorism as a heroic struggle for \"independence.\" In reply to the argument that the United States has no vital interest in Southeast Asia. Secretary Vance said: The national interest of the United States is international . . . our role of leadership is inescapable. This does not mean that we must become the policeman of the world. He said: It does mean that we must stand behind the commitments we have made if we hope to preserve peace rather than permit raw and naked power to govern. In his conclusion. Mr. Vance declared: I would say to the young divinity students then: I share your abhorrence of war. but the sacrifice of principle and the loss of freedom are worse than the loss of life. Both principle and freedom are at stake in Vietnam. and so I believe that we are engaged in a just battle. I believe. too. that the national interest of a great nation is involved wherever principle. freedom and the peace and stability of the world are imperiled. Thus. for these very reasons.

The photo caption states that \"In U.S.-Aided South Vietnam: Dusty Death Is Administered to Guerrilla Suspects Caught by U.S. Military Personnel.\" The accompanying photo. from World War II. shows Nazis dragging live Polish partisans behind jeeps. Upon inquiring at the Departments of State and Defense. I learned that the Vietcong shown in the photo was already dead. and that his body was pulled away with a rope to guard against the Communist practice of booby trapping bodies left on the battlefield. in order to blow up U.S. soldiers sent to bury them. Since the Buddhist religion requires prompt burial. a body left at the scene of battle is immediately suspect as a trap. In other instances. bodies are pulled away with a rope when they are badly decomposed. I have asked the Post Office and Justice Departments to investigate the possibility that this false photo is an act of treason. But the main purpose of these remarks is to call attention to the tactics being used by some of those who obviously hold little love for their own country.

The FBI crime report covering the 1960 to 1965 period shows that the incidence of major crimes increased by 46 percent. in the same period. the Nations population increased by only 8 percent. Crime grew nearly six times greater than population. Neither is it accurate to say that population concentration in cities is the cause of urban crime growth. Dr. Clement S. Mihanovich. professor of sociology at St. Louis University. recently published total crime statistics for 18 major cities compared to population changes reflected in official Census Bureau figures. For the 10year period. seven of those cities had population increases ranging from 10 percent to 71.42 percent while crime increases ranged from 47.29 percent to 186.80 percent. In only one of these seven cities. Dallas. was the rate of crime increase less than the rate of population increase. The other 11 cities showed. not an increase. but a decrease in population ranging from 0.28 percent to 13 percent. Yet. all 11 cities had a total crime increase ranging between 11.64 percent and 168.44 percent.

It means new schoolrooms. It means new ideas about who gets what in our schools. It means new machines and new equipment. But most of all it means new teachers. additional teachers. teachers imbued with the spirit of serving those who have been too little served by our public school system in the United States. Under the forceful leadership of President Johnson the Congress established a national teacher corps to meet the educational needs of the rural and urban poor. The funds allocated for the program were limited compared with other expenditures. The number of teachers recruited was small. Yet the impact of the program has been great in every school district affected. It is the intention of the administration to continue and strengthen the Teacher Corps. Under the committees bill. the Commissioner of Education will be able to continue to arrange with the local school boardat their requestto send Teacher Corps teams to local schools. This completely preserves the local character and local control of the Corps. In addition. committee amendments to the act provide that the poorest States will receive the largest number of Teacher Corps members. if the supply of corpsmen exceed demand from other States. This provision links the Teacher Corps teams intimately to title I of the act which is geared to the number of lowincome school children in a district. The purpose of the Teacher Corps is to supply increased numbers of qualified educational personnel to needy children whose learning has suffered from educational and economic deprivation.

General Wilson says that this was 3 percent better than the Berlin callup in 1961. and that was a 30day alert. Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to point out to my colleagues that the promptness of the civilian soldier in reporting for active duty is worthy of recognition.

Whether or not this concern is exaggerated and justified should be looked into and determined by a committee which would be established by my joint resolution.

President Johnsons moving special message on education will go down in history as the message which sought to complete the great cycle of Government support programs for the future of our children. For the President has in effect said to us that a society is often remembered in history for what it did or tried to do for the improvement of the mind and character of its citizens. Todays message calling for a new strategy in educational advance is a monument to the dedication of a President and a Congress which believe education is the first order of business of any government. The President proposes to make the promise of America real by funding the Elementary and Secondary Education Act well in advance of the school year. so that local officials can make their plans with a firm idea of the resources available for new programs. He has proposed the Educational Opportunity Act which will unify a number of existing student aid and grant and scholarships programs. He has proposed to make a college education attainable to every American childregardless of income. but based on ability. He has proposed significant increases of funds for proven experimental programs such as Headstart. Upward Bound. Followthrough. He has proposed innovations in bilingual education. and increases in vocational educational aid. He has stressed the necessity and value of educational research in teaching and learning. There is no area of educational opportunity which the President has not touched on in his messagea tribute to his comprehensive vision of our educational needs. We in the Congress who have supported the President on historic acts such as elementary and secondary education. the higher educational facilities. eco* nomic opportunity. and many others. now will stand with him as he proposes * the fulfillment of Americas pledge to give its children the best in education. I am proud to be a leader in this effort. I am proud to serve a President who does not believe in looking back. but always * looks forward. I urge the Congress to give swift positive approval to one of the finest legislative packages on education ever submitted by any President in our history.",

This is a right which is equally as vital as the four essential freedoms Franklin Roosevelt spelled out 30 years ago. The administration and the Congress have taken unparalleled steps to provide quality education for every American in the past 4 years. We have tripled our national investment in education and passed over 35 laws to support education from pre- to postgraduate school. But our Nation still faces enormous problems. Growing enrollments and rising costs strain our educational resources. Graduates are often ill prepared for the world of work. And millions of povertystricken youngsters are untouched by decent education. President Johnson seeks answers to these problems. For our gradeschool children there is Headstart and Followthrough. For our elementary schools the President has requested support for the new stayinschool program and proposed an imaginative Partnership for Learning and Earning Act. Special educational programs will help the handicapped and the student with language difficulties. But President Johnson has recognized that all too often a high school diploma is no longer a passport to prosperitya college degree is necessary. Although onehalf of our high school graduates go on to college we can no longer be satisfIed when a college education remains out of reach for millions. The Presidents Educational Opportunity Act of 1968 will go a long way toward helping deserving students secure a college educationby strengthening existing college aid programs and providing additional financial assistance to needy students with college qualifications. Yes. education for all is our fifth essential freedom in this land of abundanceand we have already taken great strides to guarantee it.

I do want to make one point and that is as to your statement that the staff study found that this was economically feasible. I would like to point out that the staff study suggested that this was so. But in so doing. the staff study reached a bit. Because what they did was. they estimated. to arrive at the annual power cost. which the staff said would be $14 million per year. they figured this on a retirement cost of the total project in 50 years on the original $312 million estimate at 1966 prices. If they increase this. as the staff says we must. at 4 percent or 5 percent. we will find the cost will be closer to $380 million and to have an annual recovery of that on the basis of 4.5 percent which the staff says is the figure. it would be close to $16.9 million annual cost. When you get to that figure. even giving the staff all the benefits of the doubt. when you figure the cost which the staff says the private utilities will pay. it is about $16.4 million annual costs. If we remove some of those figures in spite of some of the hypothecations that they had in there. and if you add $15.8 million to even them out. it becomes plain that under the taxes yielded that very clearly the private utilities. or the taxes that they will bear. that they can do this much cheaper and much better than the DickeyLincoln project.",

There are no construction costs involved here. The fact is that the project is economically feasible. It will pay back the cost with interest to the Government over a period of 50 years and it will provide power at a reasonable rate. It is well established that hydroelectric power provides the cheapest power for peaking purposes. meeting the heavy demands during the peak hours of each day. So. Mr. Chairman.

I believe that I know quite a bit about public and private power from my many years as a member and chairman of the subcommittees handling the power projects of the Department of the Interior and the Corps of Engineers. I have observed many power projects over the years and the DickeyLincoln project compares most favorably with those which we have constructed. Although you have been told today that the staff investigation carried on by your Appropriations Committee was unfavorable to the project. I want to reiterate that after this very thorough staff investigation was completed it was evident that the project was a good one. with a benefitcost ratio of 1.9 to 1. I would also like to remind my colleagues that the funds in the bill are for completion of planning only on the project and that the committee will have an opportunity to review the project again before construction is initiated. I believe everyone in this Chamber knows that New England has the highest power rates in the country25 percent above the national average. Of course. the reason the private power interests are fighting so hard in an effort to delete the project is that they do not want to have a yardstick in the area. They would like to continue to hold New England back of the rest of the countrywhich is enjoying a lower and more reasonable rate for power. I repeat. the detailed report of the committees investigations staff. printed in full in the hearings. part 1. page 382 and following. definitely confirms that the project has a favorable benefittocost ratio. that the benefits and cost estimated by the Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation are reasonable. that the project cost will be repaid with interest in 50 years. and verifies the estimates of the Federal Power Commission that the proposed private alternatives are more costly. So I hope you will support the budget estimate appoved by the committee and vote down the amendment.",

So we have to look very carefully at some of the measures used in the way of benefits in order to arrive at a more traditional evaluation of the figures that are used in connection with it. So. even though we might conclude that the favorable benefitstocost ratio does exist by reason of some of these new elements that have been injected. it does bring us back to the critical point mentioned by the gentleman from Arizona as to the timing of this planning that will bring the project into construction in the years that lie immediately ahead. years in which we can foresee no betterment of our overall fiscal position. I submit to my colleagues of the Appropriations Committee that in other areas of appropriations this year we have through sheer necessity. through our grave concern with our fiscal situation. had to defer projects of greater import to the development of this country than the one that faces us here today.

As I understand the situation. the investigating staff of the House Appropriations Committee asked the chairman of the Electric Coordinating Council of New England to contact the seven major electric utilities companies in southern New England. to find out whether they would be interested. if this power came on the line in 1974 or 1975. in purchasing it at the price given them by the investigating staff based on the price estimates made by the Department of the Interior. It is my information that all seven companies of New England that were solicited in this fashion responded in the negative. advising that they were not interested in this power at that price. that they could not use it. and they felt there were sources for this power at a more economical rate than this project could provide.",

I feel. however. that it has been grossly misinterpreted by some Members here on the floor of the House today. There were several questions submitted to the staff.

They concluded that the project was economically feasible. that there was a market for the power. and that this project the DickeyLincoln School project. would produce power at a lower rate than any private alternative could do in the New England area.",

For example. and I call this to the attention of my colleagues because money is short now and there is a war going on. and it Is our responsibility to avoid waste. it is going to cost approximately $375 a kilowatt at DickeyLincoln to build these two dams and to have 750.000 kilowatts available but not for about 8 years. It will take this long to build and flood the reservoirs. On the other hand there can be built alternate peaking power sources for approximately $70 a kilowatt hour in any one of five or six sites closer to Boston. Mass.. where most of the power is to be used. by some 200 miles. At the Bow power station In New Hampshire on the Merrimack River just below Concord. they are putting in an alternative peaking power facility for onefifth the cost of kilowatts at DickeyLincoln. This consists of two jet engines hooked up to generators. They will produce all the peaking power necessary on that circuit for $73 a kilowatt.

Mr. Chairman. prompt action on the part of the U.S. Government in entering into the construction of the Grand RiverMahoning Reservoir portion of the Lake ErieOhio Interconnecting Waterway is imperative for increased industrial efficiency. full employment. sound economic expansion. and wholesome outdoor recreational facilities. The delay of this project would insure us of frequent floods. a continued water pollution problem. and lack of adequate outdoor recreational facilities. a stream that dries in summer. and a lack of commerce which we could enjoy. A delay would keep Northeastern Ohio from realizing its full potential. So it appears that at least a portion of the gentlemans district fully supports the Grand River Reservoir. I appreciate that the families in the reservoir area who would have to be relocated oppose the project. Land acquisition. unfortunately. is a requirement of every reservoir project. We will do all we can to hold the land requirements to the minimum. But this is an essential project and should be built. The Department of National Resources of the State of Ohio concluded in its Ohio water plan inventory as follows: Even without the transportation feature. the Grand River Reservoir should be built on its merit as a complete solution for the areas problems in water supply. low flow regulation. flood control. and recreation. A reservoir of such proportions would meet the water needs of the MohoningGrand River Basins for many years and probably for all time assuring economic growth and a long period of prosperity for the area.

I would like to compliment the distinguished chairman of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee . and the highly capable ranking minority member of the committee . for their work in steering this Redwood National Park legislation to the floor of the House. It is a tribute to their efforts and those of others in this body that we today have this opportunity to create a worthy Redwood National Park in the face of trying difficulties. This opportunity to establish the proposed park reflects the wisdom. experience. guidance and understanding service rendered America by Mr. ASPINALL and Mr. SAYLOR. courageous conservationists both. I feel certain that the House can go to conference with the Senate on this legislation with the feeling that the situation Is in most capable hands. Another gentleman who has helped us to resolve the Redwood National Park issue is Representative DON CLAUSEN. distinguished Representative from Californias First District and himself a product of the great redwood forest region. Mr. CLAUSEN has offered his considerable knowledge and guidance to the Members of the House on this most sensitive of conservation matters. Many others in this body also devoted themselves to a reasonable resolution of the Redwood National Park issue and therefore deserve the gratitude of the House and all citizens of America. I register my appreciation for their efforts by strongly supporting this legislation that would preserve the magnificent redwoods of California for all Americans to enjoy in ages to come.",

This is a point which will have to be discussed in conference. I am not talking here about putting some industry out of business.

The preservation of this virgin climax redwood forest so accessible to the public alongside the Van Duzen River in public ownership will offer in one convenient area all the varied scenic and recreational attractions of the redwood region. By this action. the Congress also will keep faith with the owners of the property. who for many years have pledged to keep the land in its virgin state until the Government can find the money to acquire it for public purposes. This has been accomplished by the lumber company owners at considerable expense During the last 20 years. they have continued to protect the groves from fire and other damages and have continued to pay taxes on the land and taxes on the timber until the Government moves. During these years they have also developed these lands and maintained them for the use and enjoyment of thousands of visitors yearly. There are many. in fact. who believe that these Van Duzen groves are the most magnificent in the entire redwood region. By acquiring these outstanding lowland groves along the Van Duzen the Congress will not only serve the cause of redwood preservation and provide unusual recreational attractions. but will honor its obligations to these publicspirited landowners.",

Mr. Speaker. I would simply say this: I know what it is to have a controversial park in ones own district. and I want to say that the gentleman from California . not only came up with some imaginative and creative new ideas. but he came up with a lot of very sound advice. helpful to the committee in its deliberations. I believe Mr. CLAUSEN deserves a pat on the back from us all. He has not in any way obstructed the work of the committee in an effort to bring out a bill.

There is no question that the United States is now facing a gold crisis and that the United States is now facing a dollar crisis. We have had crises at almost every turn. but that does mean you do not take whatever action is available. This is no substitute for affirmative ac\ufffdtion which Congress should be taking. I was happy to see a few weeks ago that the official administration view had come to support my own proposal for repeal of the gold cover. as set forth in my bill. S. 1983. offered last June 21 and referred by unanimous consent to the Committee on Finance. with further reference to the Committee on Banking and Currency following its consideration there. Since the Finance Committee was occupied fully with other questions last yearincluding a good social security bill. which is overfinanced. unfortunatelyno hearings were held then. Since the administration came up with its own bill. of course. the Banking and Currency Committee quite properly moved on the question. The Finance Committee. however. did make Its usual request of executive branch agencies for comment on my bill. Five days after its introduction. Chairman William McChesney Martin. of the Federal Reserve Board. responded with a prompt reply and stated flatly. \"The Board favors enactment of the bill.\" In the meantime. he had publicly stated in a speech his agreement with my view that repeal of the gold cover must be achieved.

Professor Friedman testified on this question before the Banking and Currency Committee. Both of these gentlemen testified in favor of the legislation.

A better way. it seems to me. is to recognize that by removing this cover only partially. the administration will be obliged to undertake that reduction of foreign expenditures which will be necessary to correct the deficit in our balance of payments. and if they fail to do that. they must then come again to Congress and ask for a further removal of the cover. This would permit a continuing legislative oversight and the exertion of a continuing legislative pressure on the administration to make the changes which are necessary if this problem is to be really solved.",

I think the administration would be wise to support the amendment. and we would be wise to do the same. But this would not be their construction. The fact is that this is entirely different from the situation we have on the national debt. If we only go onefifth of the way. if we go to 20 percent. then we will be telling the world we do not wish -to permit more than $11/2 or $2 billion of additional gold outflow. After that point. the speculators will assume. we will then suspend the redeeming of dollars in gold. And we will then devalue the dollar. This is the only reason why any speculator will buy gold. He suffers a loss in doing so. because he loses the interest the dollar investment pays. he has to pay insurance on the gold. and so forth. Therefore. the construction that it would seem to me he would put on this hesitancy on the part of Congress. this insistence that we gd only from 25 to 20 percent. would be that this is a step along the way toward devaluation. That we are eventually going to arrive at that point. and that therefore he better get rid of his dollars and get his gold. and under such circumstances it would be only a matter of months before we lose the gold which -the Senator very sincerely says should be made available.",

If we want to build international confidence again in the dollar. we have got to take those measures necessary to rectify the current deficit in our balance of payments. International confidence in the dollar will not be affected. one way or the other. on the basis of whether we release $2.5 or $3 billion worth of gold to protect the dollar during the current crisis. or whether we take the cover off entirely. As long as the administration fails to reduce foreign spending sufficiently to correct the fundamental problem. there is going to be dwindling confidence in the dollar abroad. That is what is presently creating the run on the dollar. and that condition will not be eliminated until the administration ends the deficit in our international bal.ance of payments. It simply does not impress me to say that foreign confidence in the dollar will be destroyed. depending on whether we uncover only a portion of the gold. or uncover all of the gold. The foreign attitude basically relates to budgetary deficits in this country. and our lavish foreign spending. which perpetuates the imbalance in our international accounts. Until the administration is willing to address itself to these problems. it will continue to be faced with the problem of dwindling confidence in the dollar abroad. My amendment is directed toward placing pressure on the administration to come to grips with these problems. Until that happens. as sure as I stand here on the floor today. we will continue to see our gold drained away until none remains. Then. the crisis that faces us now will be pale compared to the crisis that will face us when there is no further gold as insurance to fall back upon. when there is no further gold left in the Treasury to redeem the dollar.

    "speech": "Mr. President. my amendment would not affect the bill under consideration. It would not affect the withdrawal of our Nations gold as a reserve for Federal Reserve notes outstanding. It would simply call on this body to thoroughly investigate the gold policies of our country any time our gold reserves dip as low as $10 billion. It is obvious from the comments made here today that authorities differ on what the impact of the bill we are considering will be. It is intolerable that the greatest nation on earth should simply let its gold supply dwindle to nothing without at some key point thoroughly studying its gold policies. As late as 1965 when the gold reserve requirement was removed for Federal Reserve bank deposit liabilities. there were free gold reserves of $6 billion which our international money managers felt would be sufficient to meet our money supply needs and our international commitments for some 10 years. It took just 3 intervening years during which the administration did not correct our imbalance of payments to reach another crisis. I would remind this body that our present gold cover law does not prevent the sale of gold by the United States once the Treasury gold stocks are reduced to the 25percent minimum. Instead the law provides penalties. in the form of interest rate increases on the Federal Reserve rediscount rate. for any violation of the 25percent statutory reserve requirement. Thus. our Treasury in effect is able to meet the demands of foreign creditors until the gold stocks are depletedthe question is whether or not our Government is willing to undergo the disciplinary measures which the present law requires. Finally. removal of the gold cover will do nothing to alter the critical balanceofpayments situation. While the penalty of increased interest rates would likely prompt a demand by the American public for austerity in the administrations extravagant foreign aid programs. removal of the gold cover will only increase the likelihood that excessive balanceofpayment deficits will continue. This is a critical and complex question. My amendment simply calls on this body to thoroughly study it.",

The deficit in 1967 was approximately $3.7 billion. and in 1966 there was a deficit of $1.35 billion according to the information I have. I have checked on some figures as to the cause of that deficit. Several things are involved in this. If my information is correct. the deterioration in the balanceofpayments situation for the full year of 1967 was due to several factors. One of them involved the exposition in Canada. The exposition in Canada in 1967 increased the tourist deficit by at least $350 million based upon the figures I have. Second. the British liquidation of the U.S. securities was accountable for an additional $560 million. We had a copper strike that had been going on for months and is still on. While these figures are not too recent. that strike cost at least $250 million. The figure is probably $300 to $400 million at this time. but it was $200 million at the time I got this table. I understand that the strike has not been settled as yet. and it is still costing us money in the balance of payments.",

Moreover. at that time our Government was begging foreign debtors to advance payments on their debt so that we would in some measure cope with the problem of the imbalance in payments.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the administration of this Federal program by FHA has seriously hampered the development of safe and adequate water resources in Michigan. The department of health in Michigan has appropriately required that water distribution systems be designed to provide a level of flow reasonably adequate to meet fireprotection needs. This is essential. not only for fire protection. but for economic development. If such development is to be encouraged. consideration must be given to providing adequate fire protection which is reflected. of course. in the rates charged for fire insurance. Michigan and other States have taken such factors into account in establishing their standards. Let me point to another example of FHA judgment. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. the severe winters can result in frozen water pipes. Cast iron pipe is used in water systems in that region because it can be more easily thawedelectrically. But FHA officials have taken the position that small communities in Michigans Upper Peninsula should use plastic water pipe. They argue that it has worked well in Mississippi. FHA officials complain about a lack of funds. But they seem to have enough money to send agents into the field to solicit more and more applications under the programapplications which will only gather dust in a Washington file drawer. This practice Is particularly odious because it serves to raise false hopes in hundreds of communities where adequate and soundly designed water and waste systems are desperately needed. Only eight out of about 200 Michigan applications for funds under this program have been approved to date. The other communities have been waitingand waitingwhile the FHA insists upon plastic water pipe in Michigan and pressures for Inferior engineering standards. The members of the Michigan Republican delegation in Congress became so concerned about this situation that they recently dispatched a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture urging the Department to reappraise existing procedures with a view toward adopting more equitable practices. The letter summarized the problem very well. and I ask that it be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

For too long the Commissioner of Education. Harold Howe. has had his heel on the neck of the people of the South. He has \"zeroed in\" on the 17 Southern and Border States and applied his illegal guidelines to those 17 States and has apparently forgotten the balance of the States in this country. The guidelines are illegal. but if they are to be enforced. then let them be enforced across the board. It has been interesting to listen to some of the debate on the part of many of my colleagues from the North who for some reason do not want the guidelines applied to them. What are they afraid of? I suggest that if the guidelines were applied uniformly throughout the United States. we would be getting a little more help from some of our northern colleagues in our. fight to make the guidelines comply with the law as passed by this Congress. Mr. Chairman. it has been our contention for some time that the Commissioner of Education has drafted his guidelines contrary to the law. One way to stop this is to require that all sections of the guidelines cite the applicable provision of the law upon which the section is based. What is wrong with this? Is not the Commissioner .of Education bound by the law? If so. then why should he not cite the law which authorizes his guidelines? Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Spence retired from Congress In 1962. after more than 30 years of service. Through his long and productive life. Brent Spence piled up distinction as a lawyer. State senator. and city solicitor. as well as that of Congressman and chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee. Those of us who knew him well in the House of Representatives feel that from the moment of his appearance In the House to the day of his retirement. he upheld the noblest standards of legislative integrity and statesmanship. He served during. some of the most critical years of our countrys history and won the respect of his district. his State. and the country. Both the domestic economy and the world community were greatly affected by his efforts. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act of 1950. and the Housing Act of 1949. the Defense Production Act of 1950. and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 are examples of his performance.

When I came to Congress in 1944 and took a seat on the Banking and Currency Committee. this great gentleman was my chairman until he retired in 1962. Over these many years he was an inspiration to me with his guidance and counsel and his earnest efforts on behalf of legislation to Improve the life and environment of our people. As chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency. Brent Spence led some of the toughest legislative battles that were fought in the Congress. He pioneered in the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. which are basic and vital cogs in our world monetary system. He was the field marshal in our committee and in the House for the complex banking legislation which often seems mysterious to the layman but which is vital in helping to make our economic system work. He was a great leader in the field of housing legislation and played a major role in the first great hurdle to bring better housing to Americans and to improve our cities. the Housing Act of 1949.

A Mr. Harry Ashmore. sometime editor. of Little Rock. Ark.. and a Mr. William C. Baggs. an editor from Miami. Fla.. went to Hanoi last February. met with Ho Chi Minh. and came back home with certain peace proposals of their own. Now because those proposals. like all others to Hanoi. have added up to one big. round. fat goose egg. Messrs. Ashmore and Baggs have accused the State Department of \"double dealing\" and the President of an \"almost total absence of candor.\" How naive can you be? I can understand that the snow job Ho Chi Minh did on these two wouldbe Secretaries of State must have made them feel pretty important. But did they not think that perhaps the President and the State Department might have had some other irons in the diplomatic fire? Did they not realize that perhaps the conduct of national diplomacy requires that not every move the President may be making should be disclosed to two itinerant newspapermen fresh from visiting Ho Chi Minh? I am a little ashamed that the Washington Post should have featured this bit of sourgraping on page 1 in screaming headlines that can only confuse the American public and encourage the Communist enemy in Hanoi. particularly since on page 18 of the same paper their own reporter. Mr. Chalmers Roberts. reports a full chronology of Vietnam peace efforts that make it clear that long before the Ashmore letter was sent and replied to the President and State Department had already received flat refusal from Hanoi. not just to some vague bid for reciprocal deescalation. but to a detailed analysis of all possible methods for reciprocal deescalation.",

He proposes that private industry be invited to do the joba position we Republicans have been advancing against overwhelming indifference in this Congress and downtown for the past 4 years. But. instead of doing the job plainly and above board. the President has suggested that business firms who participate can get \"special advantages in bidding on Government contracts.\" This. of course. is downright bribery. It is use of the taxpayers dollars to coerce business to earn favors at the Pentagon by participation in the Presidents program: It is an open invitation to corruption and clandestine deals. It is discriminatory against firms that might be extremely capable in the field of defense production. but financially not able to go into the social welfare field. They would lose defense contracts to firms who might not be able to produce as well or cheaply but who \"played ball\" with L. B. J. I contrast with this process the Republican Human Investment Act which proposes to supply job training. by the simple and practical process of providing tax incentives to reimburse business firms for the expenses of buying machinery. hiring technicians and providing jobtraining facilities. This is a straightforward approach. It would do the job without undue cost to the taxpayer and without the taint of privilege or favor. I regret that the worthwhile objectives of the Presidents program have been entwined with the questionable policy of special favors in return for helping the poor and unemployed.

So the White Sox decided to postpone their pennant for 1 year that 1968 would be a year of double celebration. in October of 1968 the White Sox winning the pennant and in November of 1968 President Johnson being reelected to another term as President of the United States.",

The reason. of course. is that our Republican colleagues have irresponsibly voted for recommital of the resolution for a continuing appropriation. Their purpose. Mr. Speaker. is either to admit their failure to deal with the complexities of the budget or to embarrass the President of the United States. Apparently our Republican colleagues are blind to every consideration. except election year 1968. Anything they can do nowincluding paralyzing the U.S. Governmentto bolster their chances next year seems to be fair game. I doubt whether Congress has ever witnessed more irresponsible and reckless conduct by the total membership of one side of the aisle. These Republicans know full well that President Johnson is not the only one responsible for trimming the budget. Only the Congress can repeal or amend the laws which set these expenditures. But our Republican colleagues want to pretend this is not so. They want President Johnson to wield the cutting knife. They want him to take the heat and cut back on such programs as aid to our schools. housing funds for our cities. protection for our commercial airways. aid to our veterans hospitals. and loans to bring electricity to our farmers. In their actions. they are completely allocating their responsibilities as Members of Congress to judge on the budget items submitted to Congress by the President. The Republicans want $5 billion cut from the budget. Let them tell us where to start cutting. Mr. Speaker. Let them give us the specificswhat programs and in whose district. Let them stop playing such blatant and hypocritical politics with such a vital matter as the Nations fiscal welfare. Oet6ber 3. 1967",

I endorsed the establishment of a Job Corps camp in Casper. Wyo. I am concerned for poor people. I shall support this program precisely because of my concern for poor people. I believe there is a relevance between headlong inflation and poor people. It has already been pointed out in the debate that the persons who are hurt first and who suffer most are the poor people. Let me relate to the Senate what inflation last year amounted to in terms of an additional sales tax to my people of Wyoming. The 3percent increase in inflation last year had the same effect on the payrolls and the pocketbooks of the people of Wyoming as would have resulted from an increase In our sales tax there by 5 percent. I am concerned about inflation and an unbalanced budget because we have voted 4 1- to 6percent salary increases for Government employees on the floor. It is easy to be in favor of economy. and it is easy to make these arguments about our concern for the poor. for the uneducated. for the people who are underprivileged. But if we are to have a balanced budget. we must get down to specifics and say how we will cut and where we will cut. All we need do is to look at England in order to realize what can happen in America. We forget that it might happen here. England has gone through the same process. It has appropriated and has spent more money than it has taken in. It had to devalue the pound. The prediction is that perhaps within 18 months Great Britain will have to institute another devaluation. and this points out the dangers inherent in appropriating more money and spending more money. year after year. than we take in. Englands irresponsible lack of sound fiscal management. which our actions here parallel. has not helped the poorit has hurt them. No one understand that more clearly than Great Britains poor people.

I call attention to another point. This is not the only program for job training or daycare centers. and so forth. Millions of dollars are included in the social security bill. upon which we will vote tomorrow. for daycare centers. millions of dollars for work training programs. These are the same types of programs that are in this bill. Many of us have believed that these programs should be consolidated into one program. When twn or three bureaucracies are established too much money is going for bureaucratic salaries rather than getting down to the people who need it. I repeat. hundreds of million of dollars involved in the other programs will be appropriated and authorized by the bills we will act on tomorrow. So this is not the only program. It is not the only program dealing with the same people doing the same jobs. We must also recognize that there is a question as to how far we can go. because as the small business places which are handicapped by these Increased taxes go bankrupt the same people lose jobs. Mr. President. there Is a happy medium somewhere. This Is only a difference of opinion as to where we reach this happy medium and what we can afford and cannot afford.

I must say I believe the Senator from Delaware has a point when he suggests that we adopt a $1.6 billion figure. just as the House has done. so that we do not have to go to conference on it and we would not have anything to worry about. At the same time I think it is quite clear in the face of increased government salaries and in the face of increases in the cost of living that some modest increase over that amount is necessary. In this mornings newspapers. the OEO has come out and stated that in order to continue with the present programs they need $1.788.000.000. This figure may possibly be subject to a 10percent reduction or some reduction. I think there is certain discretion in the Presidents office on this matter. However. we should make up our minds that we are in a war. that we have the highest interest rates now since the Civil War. and that this inflation is going to go on if we do not do something about it. I suggest to my good friend from Delaware that we might be a little more realistic if the amendment could be modified to $1.788 million. which is the amount that the OEO said it needs. then. let the Senate conferees go to the House and stand up for this.

We are now back to the point where we are told it will not affect the program at all because it is meaningless. Mr. President. it is not meaningless to save $192 million. That is the amount involved in this proposal. An argument has been made that if this amendment is adopted a disaster is going to develop with Headstart or with the povertystricken individual who will be looking for a job. That is a smokescreen. Why does not somebody mention that we might eliminate at least one of the high bureaucratic salaries? Let us not overlook the fact that the administrator of this poverty program and some of his associates are drawing more money in salaries than General Westmoreland draws for managing and taking charge of the war in Vietnam. There are any number of employees on the payroll of the poverty program drawing more money than mayors and some Governors of States. But nobody mentions that we might cut back on one of those items. Why? No one expresses concern over these large salaries. Those luxury jobs must be continued and expanded. and all of the punishment will be taken out down below. That is a shopworn argument. Let us not forget that these are not the only programs dealing with poverty or lack of jobs. There are day care centers. training programs. and several welfare and relief programs under other agencies and all operating in the same general area. With the elimination of the overlapping of the highsalaried bureaucracy it would well save more than $192 million.

To further subsidize the housing of a free people in the name of compassion is to permit further atrophy of the American people. and our tomorrows would record that mistake. Let us be compassionate enough for the future of the American people to ask of them selfreliance and endurance of temporary hardships today in order that our strength thus gained will keep us free tomorrow. and to require of ourselves fiscal responsibility toward that goal. Fiscal responsibility demands a dollars worth of value received for every dollar spent. In 1967. social planning seems to be an obsession with many. but there is increasing evidence that educational emphasis and planning will properly replace it. Mr. Chairman. I would like to include in my remarks the following writing which is not just an echo. but a present and eternal challenge for the United States of America: AMERICA When God made the oyster. he guaranteed his absolute economic and social security. He built the oyster a house. his shell. to shelter and protect him from his enemies. When hungry. the oyster simply opens his shell. and food rushes in for him. He has Freedom from Want. But when God made the Eagle. He declared. \"The blue sky is the limitbuild your own house!\" So the Eagle built on the highest mountain. Storms threaten him every day. For food. he flies through miles of rain and snow and wind. The Eagle. not the oyster. is the emblem of America.",

In a study released last August. the National Education Association report on Spanishspeaking children stated: Many of these young people experience academic failure in school. At best. they have limited success. A large percentage become school dropouts. . . . And little headway is being made against the problem. The National Education Association report called for action: The need is for actionNow! To meet the problem fully. however. further legislation and substantially increased appropriations are needed. A more intensive effort to recruit additional teachers from among the Spanishspeaking is another Imperative. Additional research. especially of a demonstration nature. Is yet another. An extended series of needs could be listed. But the urgent need is for action and innovation in local school districts almost everywhere. Significantly. the report was entitled \"The Invisible Minority.\" These schoolchildren are the forgotten children. We have various programs for disadvantaged schoolchildren. Those programs are far from adequate and must be greatly expanded. Today I have introduced a bill which I believe would establish imaginative and useful programs for the nonEnglishspeaking schoolchild. The bilingual education proposal has been developed by Senator YARBOROUGH. Representative ROYBAL. and Representative SCHEUER. I am happy to join in sponsoring this legislation. Entitled the \"Bilingual Education Act.\" this bill would give grants to local school districts for bilingual education programs. such as teacher training. special materials. preschool. adult education. guidance and counseling. remedial instruction. as well as summer programs. The bill authorizes $25 million for fiscal year 1968. $35 million for fiscal year 1969. and $50 million for fiscal year These sums are modest when compared with the need. They are also modest when it is realized that the best investment America can make Is In the future generation. As the NEA report says. \"the need Is for actionnow.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to amend the patent laws. title 35 of the United States Code. I do this for two reasons: First. to eliminate delay in the issue of patent applications. and second. to offer a more positive solution to existing inadequacies in the patent law. The administration has recommended a bill to this Congress. H.R. 5924. labeled the Patent Reform Act of 1967. In my opinion. this bill does little to reform the patent system. rather it changes the philosophy of the patent laws of the United States and in the process stands the. chance of adversely affecting the rights of every inventor and manufacturer in our country. The purpose of any patent reform should be to provide earlier issue of patents. earlier publication of new technology. greater uniformity of decisions by the Patent Office. and reduction of this offices workload. My bill would accomplish just this. It differs in its approach from H.R. 5924 in that instead of changing the philosophy of the patent system by adopting the firsttofile rule in lieu of the firstinventor rule and abolishing the existing 1year grace period to allow an inventor to perfect his invention. this legislation retains the historic advantages to a U.S. patent applicant and patentee and only changes the existing rules to minimize delays. In other words. my bill improves the present system rather than installs a new. unwanted system with a different philosophical concept. I sincerely hope that those presently laboring. sometimes at great sacrifice to themselves. their families and their country. to improve the technology of this great country. will be allowed to benefit from this new legislation. just as you and I have benefited from their stirring discoveries in the past.",

If this resolution is adopted. every Member introducing a bill. other than private bills and resolutions and appropriations bills. would be required to state at the end of the bill what it would cost. Presently. when bills are introduced or recommended for introduction. much research is required to establish the cost factor involved. This situation would be helped if House rules required this research be done by the Member who introduces the bill in the first place. My colleague . whose experience on the Committee on Appropriations has shown him the necessity for such legislation. made a good point when he introduced this resolution. He said: I believe a required estimate of cost will be a useful deterrent to waste in a time of fiscal crisis. Members will hesitate to introduce \"potofgold\" proposals If they show multibillion dollar costs. Cost estimates are often good evidence of irresponsible legislation.",

I will point out the gross inequalities which defeat the primary objectives of the billa fair distribution of Federal aid throughout the Nation. I cannot believe that the facts I present represent a deliberate effort by Commissioner of Education Howe to present an unfair bill. Otherwise. he would not have completely overlooked the needs of 249.000 poor children in President Johnsons State of Texas and 88.000 poor children in Kentucky. represented by the distinguished chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. Yet the administration bill does just that. I am a firm believer in Federal aid to education. along with many of my Republican colleagues who recall that the first serious attempt to create a broad Federalaid program was sponsored by the late Senator Robert A. Taft. The facts I am putting on the record have no political motivation. we need the most effective legislation possible so that our schools may meet the educational needs of every child. This. and this alone. is the object of all proposed Republican amendments. If this legislation is unfair in its distribution of aid. there cannot be a victory for anyone when one poor child loses educational advantages.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the truth -is out. This administration has absolutely no intention of holding down spending or even of setting professed priorities on spending. judging from the request yesterday by the Secretary of the Treasury to boost the national debt ceiling by $29 billion and making the new ceiling permanent at $365 billion. Apparently the $6 billion increase voted in the debt limit just 3 months ago was but a ripple compared to the avalanche now plummeting toward us. The Treasury Secretary was followed to the stand by the Director of the Budget at the Ways and Means Committee hearings. and both blamed the Vietnam war costs for the $29 billion request. But. Mr. Speaker. that is only part of the story. Naturally the war is costly. and we must equip our fighting men with the best. But where are those priorities in spending so heralded by the administration earlier this year? This latest request is a complete admission that no such priorities exist and that there is no intention to cut domestic spending. Apparently the Nation is to be pushed more rapidly into debt while blaming It on the war. Unless Congress. through authorizing legislation and appropriations. decides to hold the line. the situation will worsen at a great rate. I also noted that the Treasury Secretary now estimates that the deficit for the current fiscal year ending June 30 will be about $11 billion instead of the $9. billion estimated earlier this yearand that the fiscal 1968 budget starting July first will be $11 billion instead of the $8.1 billion estimated in January. He even admits the 1968 deficit may rise to as much as $24 billion. which is probably much closer to the truth. These estimates are undoubtedly conservative. because they depend on Congress enacting a 6percent Increase in personal and corporate income taxes. which was again confirmed by the Treasury Secretary. Add to this another round of requests for gimmicky bookkeeping authority. and the true financial picture is dark indeed. It was interesting to note that the Treasury Secretary sidestepped any concrete budget estimates by saying that the deficit is vulnerable to greater than usual uncertainties. Mr. Speaker. the main vulnerability of the deficit. as with the budget. is the uncertainty of this administration.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I would like to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisles in introducing legislation concerning the taxation of reimbursed moving expenses. There has been much confusion in the past few years concerning the taxation of these moving expenses reimbursed to employees who are asked to relocate. The standard practice in the past has been to exclude reimbursed moving expenses from the taxable income of the employee. The discrepancy arises in the definition of \"moving expenses.\" To the employer this term encompasses all outofpocket expenses incurred by the employee in the process of moving. This includes such costs as a househunting trip. temporary living expenses at the new location. settlement of unexpired leases. and other miscellaneous expenses. The IRS. on the other hand. allows only the cost of the direct transportation of a person. his family. and personal property from one location to another. This definition is rather unrealistic in view of the fact that these reimbursed moving expenses other than transportation costs are not income. It would seem therefore. that the Treasury has no right to tax them. This practice is also unfair in light of the fact that civil service employees. who were previously allowed only transportation costs as nontaxable. are now granted. under Public Law 89516. moving costs over and above this basic cost. Mr. Speaker. mobility is an essential feature of our American way of life. It is important to our defense and space efforts. and it is essential to business and our economy in general. I hope my colleagues will join with me in support of this legislation to end the present unfair treatment of those whose jobs require them to relocate.",

Despite the optimistic propaganda which our negotiators are issuing from Geneva. American farmers have not been guaranteed access to European markets. There is every indication. however. that we have given up valuable protection of our own markets. The Europeans. for example. will determine the amount of U.S. exports that it will permit to enter its member countries and the exact terms. The U.S. negotiating team made no similar demands. We cannot hope to effectively regulate beef and dairy imports with a tariff or levy system if we continue to bargain away badly needed protection without getting any concessions in return.

Even this does not tell the full story. Of the 25.300 acres in the House proposal. approximately 18.000 acres are currently in State parks. which must be donated by the State to complete the national park. Thus. only 7.000 additional acres would be protected. Furthermore. it will be difficult to persuade the State to contribute its fine State parks to such a pathetic Federal effort.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Supreme Courts dictum that advertising should be Judged by its \"probable effect on trusting minds\" is only one of the principles of business ethics which has been violated In the maze of servicestation games thrust upon the American motorist in the past 2 years. Oil companies have financed the familiar games and their advertising through coercion of individual dealers. and. ultimately. through a rise in the cost of gasoline to the consumer. If misleading advertising were the only issue at hand. the hearings of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Agencies would already have accomplished their purpose. the newspaper articles which I am submitting to the Rzcoan reflect a growing awareness on the part of the American public that \"giveaway games\" seldom giveaway something for nothing. It is sad that advertising in this country must create in many honest consumers a constant attitude of skepticism and cynicism in the marketplace---an attitude easily carried over into other areas. But equally serious is a problem which we have yet to solve and correct through our hearings: that of the manner in which the games and their advertising have been financed. Threats to dealers who refuse to participate in the games have been accompanied by a forced additional rise in the price of gas to the customers of dealers who have accepted them. A sense of fear over cancellation of station franchises and other forms of coercion has replaced the healthy profit incentive in the minds of hundreds of individual dealers as they make their decisions on participation in the games. only at this great price has it been possible for oil companies to force their gigantic game enterprises upon the dealer and the public. It is to the credit of the Greenfield Recorder. whose editorials I submit here. and the many other papers and radio and TV stations in my district and across the country that these misdemeanors are being brought before the people. Only as the public is made aware of these practices can it successfully combat them. for. in the final analysis. the good that may come of our hearings rests upon popular consensus of what is right and fair in the conduct of business. Two articles follow: [From the Greenfield Recorder. June 20. 1968]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the television networks programs and newscasting are off the beam. Drew Pearson calls attention to this most abominable degradation practised upon an unsuspecting public. Only in recent months have I been a TV viewer to any degree. I did not realize previously what tripe is being dished out on television. Youngsters are the victims of this sordid programing. It cannot be said that the TV portrayals are aiding in the curtailment of violence and the explosive crime rate. Violence and brutality are the keystones of many of the \"top rated\" programs enjoying what is called prime time on the networks. Drew Pearson. in a recent column. listed many of these shows along with the sponsors of such degrading TV programs. and a valid suggestion is made that the public can correct this situation by writing their views to those who put up the money so that these TV programs can be broadcast. The general run of the news reporting by the networks is repugnant to a sizable number of TV audiences. A letter writing campaign for wholesome news commentaries Is badly needed. The Drew Pearson column follows: MvERRYGoRoUND (By Drew Pearson) WASINGTON.-During the national anguish over Sen. Robert Kennedys assassination. the TV networks suddenly got nervous about video violence and tried to clean some of the bloodshed off the home screen. ABCs spy series. \"It Takes a Thief.\" dropped two assassination plots. A sniper story was discreetly edited out of the FBI series. ABC also hastily juggled episodes of \"The Avengers.\" \"Guns of Will Sonnett\" and \"Man In A Suitcase\" in favor of something less homicidal. NBC and CBS made similar shifts in episodes of \"Bonanza\" and \"Mannix.\" respectively. Yet the networks. after a decent period of mourning. have now resumed their full schedule of violence. And they have already lined up two dozen shows for next season featuring gunplay. brutality. sadism. and terror. The National Association for Better Broadcasting estimates that the average child between ages 5 and 15 watches the violent destruction of more than 13.400 persons on TV. \"Most are gunned down.\" reports Frank Orme. the associations executive vice president. \"but fire. rape. poison. acid. spiders. snakes. crocodiles. pitchforks. knives. time bombs. live steam. poison gas. hypodermic needles and an assortment of heavy blunt instruments are all used to add spice and variety and thrills to the spectacle of death.\"",

It will not work. It cannot adequately be implemented without a national police forcewhich nobody wants--and it will not reach the unlawful gunman in any event. He will remain just as unlawful and just as secretive. with or without a Federal registration requirement. What is needed. is a law under which it becomes just too risky to carry or use a gun in crime. that is. in the commission or attempted commission of crime. to be a separate Federal offense with a mandatory minimum sentence upon conviction. This will make those criminals who think at all. think twice before using or carrying a gun. Also. a law that imposes upon the seller of a gun. a requirement that the buyer shall produce for the sellers public retention on file. a certificate from his home community that he has no criminal or mental record and is over 21 years of age.

He now expects our imports of U.S.S.R. chromite ore to \"increase significantly\" in 1968. He states that it is in our \"overall national interest\" to not import chromite ore from Rhodesia and thus increase our imports from the U.S.S.R.

The Biafran famine is the largest world problem of this kind since the Second World War when many refugees were starving. I am hopeful that America will not sit by and wring its hands when there is so much that must be done. If it is true that there are 3 or 4 million persons starving inside Biafra and roughly threequarters of a million persons starving in Nigeria. then it will take much more transport and food to help these people than has been undertaken. The article. entitled \"Red Cross Flights Halted.\" indicates that the Red Cross \"mercy flights of medical and food supplies to Biafra had been halted by technical difficulties.\" In reading the articles. it seems to me that the flights are still the only form of transport for the food going in. These flights land on a roadway in three different areas. but no overland shipment is being reported. I was pleased to learn that the U.S. AID program has provided $5.3 million of emergency relief funds. some of which may be used to assist in transporting the food. I would urge that the United States work more closely with the United Nations and with the International Red Cross to get the roadway opened up for overland shipment. Unless that roadway is neutralized so food can get in to the starving peoples. all those who have it within their means to obtain an agreement between the warring factions of Nigeria and Biafra will have failed. I would urge that this world problem be dealt with by a community of nations if the U.N. is unable to act. I understand that Great Britain has supplied a number of trucks which could be used. and that Norway has provided a team of doctors. But if 200 tons of food a day will feed roughly 600.000 persons. much more will be necessary than the few airplane loads of food flown in to Biafra so far.",

Even though the amendment was defeated on that occasion. the gentlewoman from Missouri and those of us who were Interested in this approach to the food problem. for our poor. our aged. our pensioners and our underprivileged persisted until the food stamp program became a reality on a trial basis. One of the counties in my congressional district. which had the greatest rate of unemployment anywhere in the United States. was selected as one of the experimental counties. In actual practice. the food stamp plan has been a boon. not just to those who qualify to receive the stamps. but to the merchants and business people in our community. In view of the fact that many persons who are recipients of the benefits are elderly citizens. living on very limited income. this plan enables them to have",

This is a strong voice from a very strong group of men who represent millions of employees throughout this country. This is an important endorsement. not because it is a labor organization. but because the endorsement must reflect the views of the rank and file of trades and crafts and industries throughout our country. The workingman in America fully understands the meaning of a Communist takeover. whether it is in Southeast Asia or in Europe or in South America. And the AFLCIO through its international efforts has been a bulwark in the international free trade union movement. President Johnsons policies in Vietnam carry on the policies of two PresidentsKennedy and Eisenhower. Eisenhower made the original commitment to Southeast Asia with SEATO in 1954. President Kennedy recognized the threat not only to Vietnam. but to Laos and Cambodia. And President Johnson realized that without a direct American involvement. there might not be a free Southeast Asia in a few years. So. the United States is standing up to what it and many others believe is Communist aggression. Communist subversion and Communist takeover. I am proud that the AFLCIO had the wisdom and strength to back the President all the way on Vietnam.",

The same distinguished gentleman expressed his sympathy for the Oklahoma delegation in Congress because of the predicted Orange Bowl result. and with tongue in cheek proceeded to recommend that the Sooners be decorated for bravery for daring to meet the Tennessee Volunteers in a football contest. In fact. he said he was sending our team copies of the book. \"Profiles in Courage.\" in recognition of their football bravery. Mr. Speaker. every Oklahoman now has an added reason to look forward to the Orange Bowl classic. and the moment of truth which follows. With characteristic Tennessee modesty. Congressman BLANTON has claimed that the Volunteers are \"the No. 1 football team in the Nation.\" and appears to believe that makes their victory a sure thing. The Sooner team has been dealing with this brand of blissful overconfidence all season. and likes nothing better than moving up the ladder of national rankings over the battered remains of overconfident opponents. The Orange Bowl. which In fact provides a battle between the two college teams generally ranked as No. 2Tennesseeand No. 3Oklahomais almost certain to provide the best college football game on your television screen January 1.

I merely wish to associate myself with every word of it. because these things need to be said over and over again as we continue to slaughter American boys in a war in which we should never have become involved. We are now faced with a Secretary of State who does not have the courage to come before the American people and answer questions put to him by the representatives of the people in a public session of the Committee on Foreign Relations. He knows he will be protected under the separationofpowers doctrine in connection with any improper question that any Senator might try to ask of him. However. under our Constitution the Congress represents the people in carrying out the checks of the Constitution under the adviseandconsent clause. Foreign policy belongs to the American people. not to the President or the Secretary of State or the Congress. A committee of the Senate has the constitutional right to call the Secretary of State before it for public examination. The American people should make clear to the President of the United States that they want to know whether he supports the Secretary of State in his refusal to testify on Vietnam at a public hearing called by the Foreign Relations Committee. I repeat that a basic constitutional question has been raised by Secretary Rusk. If the President says that he supports Secretary Rusk in his refusal to attend a public hearing. then let the American people take note that the President himself knowingly contributes to the growing trend of creating more and more government in our country by executive supremacy. The President should be the first to protect. the people from such a violation of their constitutional rights. The people already are worried about government by secrecy. They are particularly concerned about a failure to deliver to the American people full information about our policies and conduct in prosecuting this undeclared war. This growing suspicion will be augmented by Rusks inexcusable obstinacy. If the President does not support the Secretary of State. then he should order him to testify. and if he refuses. he should fire him.",

Mr. President. unfortunately. on other occasions in the past. the Joint Chiefs of Staff have dominated the Secretary of Defense.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I support the District of Columbia crime bill as reported by the Senate District Committee. The crime rate in the Nations Capital is a national disgrace. It also reflects the grave menace that serious and evermounting crime throughout the United States poses to our internal security. According to the most recent FBI report. the crime rate in the District of Columbia for the first 9 months of 1967 has increased 34 percent over the comparable period in 1966. In other words. it is more than double the 16percent national rate of increase during the first 9 months of this year. The report accompanying the bill contains alarming statistics and indicates that the District of Columbia is rapidly becoming a crime jungle. The need to furnish the police more effective tools with which to combat this menace is compelling. The Senate Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures. of which I am chairman. has held extensive hearings this session on the problems of crime. We concluded that the Nation is indeed facing a crisis and that congressional action is imperative. We reported a bill from the subcommittee that has many parts similar to the good features of the pending bill. While I am in general agreement with the provisions of the pending bill. I particularly favor providing that the police can detain and question a suspect for a period of time before taking the suspect before a committing magistrate. The pending bill provides that any confession obtained during that period of detention is not to be inadmissible solely because of delay in presenting the suspect before the comnitting magistrate. The bill reported by the Criminal Laws and Procedures Subcommittee provides that a confession will not be deemed inadmissible solely because of delay. in arraignment. Both bills seek to place the inadmissibility of confessions in its proper perspective. Selfincriminating statements. voluntarily made. have historically been treated as strong and convincing evidence of guilt. They should be so treated and so received in the future. In the interest of curbing lawlessness in the District of Columbia and increasing the effectiveness of law enforcement. I am glad to have the opportunity to vote for the passage of this measure. Mr. President. I commend the able chairman of the District Committee and its members for presenting the pending bill to the Senate. I hope that the bill will be enacted into law.",

I believe all of us are aware of the comments of both the Presidents National Crime Commission and his District of Columbia Crime Commission in their reports to the American people about the importance of gun control legislation.

I know that some legislation has been proposed for the improved control of handguns in the District of Columbia. but even that legislation has not been considered by the committee. Certainly any comprehensive review of gun controls in the District of Columbia would also have to include the question of the need for control over long arms as well. Because of the extraordinary amount of deliberation that has been given to this problem by the Committee on the Judiciary over a number of years. there is available to all the Members of this body a very complete and exhaustive record as to the need for both national and local gun control legislation.

So long as they feel that they can get additional appropriations in supplemental bills. year after year. in almost such amounts as they request. they will continue to do so. It seems to me that we should adopt some procedure whereby a Government agency will know that what it is given in an appropriation bill is the amount it will get. and no more. I hope some step can be taken along this line. The bill now under consideration contains an amount recommended by the Senate of $2.260.246.933in other words. more than two and a half billion dollars above the amount appropriated for these agencies in the regular appropriation bill.

The most pernicious aspect of supplemental bills. in my opinion. is not only that you add to the total budget each year. and to the total appropriations. but also. as was expressed in the committee meetings and in the hearings. that time after time this method has been utilized by the executive branch to get their nose under the tent. knowing that if they get their nose under the tent. they are going to come in. in the full appropriations bill. with the whole camel. This is what we must avoid. This is one of the best classic examples of what a supplemental appropriations bill should not be. Programs which have not been financed. heretofore. are now coming in. to get their nose under the tent. If the appropriation bills are not passed by July 1. they will also be entitled to the extra consideration of a continuing resolution. which will permit them to spend until the appropriation bills are passed. and. in addition. havIng secured just this little bit. they are almost certain of continuing that particular program in the future.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am most happy to see that the Senate Committee on Appropriations has seen fit to restore the full budget estimate of $71 million for grantsinaid for airports in 1968. I hope that the Senate will vote today to appropriate this entire amount. and that the conferees from this body will try to keep this figure intact when they confer with the House Members. I am concerned. Mr. President. by the continuing lag in development of the Nations network of public airports. The most recent national airport plan issued by the FAA identifies development needs eligible for Federal financial assistance totaling $1.5 billion through 1972. The extent of such needs is confirmed by the knowledge that 730 communities have filed applications for financial assistance totaling $313 million under the 1968 program. At least 95 percent of such requirements represents both bona fide development needs and community ability and readiness to provide the matching funds necessary to proceed with the needed development. The amount recommended by the Senate committee. $71 million. will permit the programing of only 25 peicent of the requests submitted by local sponsors for 1968.. I was alarmed when the bill was reported by the House with only $61 million included for airports in 1968. My understanding is that the House committee. in making its recommendation. cited various carryover funds which they thought would continue to be available in 1968. However. the fact is that these funds are either committed to specific projects previously requested by localities or are not available to the 1968 program because of the State apportionment provisions of the Federal Airport Act. The Senate committee has made this clear in its recommendation. and has recommended the full restoration of the initial budget estimate. I urge the Senate to adopt the committees recommendations and to adopt this restoration. every penny and more of which is urgently needed for the development of a safe. efficient airport system in the United States.",

Since the act has been placed on the statute books. we have been able to increase sales abroad by over $2.3 billion since 1960. when this new program became effectivethat is. the law that affected wheat. corn. and other feed grains. The record will show that we sold in excess of $6.8 billion in fiscal 1967 compared to $4.5 billion in 1960. The reason for that is. the commodities we produced are sold on the world market at whatever the world market price is. Before that. we could not do that because we had a support price of a certain percentage of parity and if any cotton. wheat. or corn were sold abroad. the Federal Government had to pick up the difference between the fixed parity pricethat is the percent of parity that was determined by the Secretary of Agricultureand the world market. In other words. it just happened that cotton. before the act went into effect was on a twoprice system. The mills in the United States paid the going price which was almost the price support. The world price was about 8.5 cents less per pound than the support price. Therefore. we had more or less of a subsidy made available to the foreign mills. while domestic mills had to pay the support price. which was about 8.5 cents more per pound than the price of cotton sold abroad. In order to be able to sell cotton and wheat at world market prices without the export subsidies. so that our domestic prices are maintained at world prices. we must pay the producer of those commodities not to overplant. It strikes me. Mr. President. that we have done a good job. and I hope that the pending amendment will be rejected.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I recognize the arguments of the Senator from Louisiana. but we have this situation. Congress has fixed the price of cotton at 30 cents or 32 cents per pound. depending upon the areas. To the extent the farmers sell this cotton below the price they do not have to be even a little bit concerned whether they get 25 cents or 15 cents a pound because the Government subsidy pays the differential. We are in effect operating the Brannan plan so far as cotton is concerned. American cotton cannot compete with foreign cotton. but we should take care of the problem by adjusting tariff rates. As it operates now payments are made on the one hand not to cultivate and produce cotton. and on the other hand. we pay and guarantee a profitable margin of 30 cents per pound irrespective of the domestic market. Many agriculture products operate in the free market. If the market declines they lose money. and they lose it out of their pockets. That is true to a large extent with poultry. dairy products. beef. and so on. but on this particular commodity we have an area where producers are guaranteed a liberal margin of profit regardless of how low the world market may be or how low they may sell it in the domestic market. The result is a $3 to $4 billion annual subsidy. much of which is paid to the large corporate type of farmers. This is the wrong kind of program. and the American taxpayers cannot afford the cost. Besides this special treatment for producers of some commodities is unfair to those other farmers who are forced to sell in a free market.",

There is one ridiculous situation in cotton where one farm operation in the Midwest is owned by a British company. This corporation is producing cotton in this country and receiving over onehalf million dollars annually in subsidy. It then can ship this subsidized cotton back to British mills for manufacture. They are producing cotton here in this country to get the subsidy. and then turning around and buying it at the low world market price and shipping it to their own mills in England. Conceivably the manufactured cotton article can then be exported back to the United States. I do not think that this makes sense. It does not benefit the bona fide cotton farmer. the wheat farmer. or any other kind of farmer. This cannot even be called a subsidy for the American consumer since cotton cloth here in America is retailing today at prices higher than before the subsidy was initiated. As usual the taxpayers are the goats. If we want a program for the benefit of the small farmer this amendment should be approved.",

I have covered that. to some extent. but I simply want to indicate to the Senate what the .condition is so far as the Commodity Credit Corporation is concerned. The surplus reduction is a function of both production adjustment and market development. Each has had a part in reducing the Commodity Credit Corporation inventories from $6.148.000.000 in October of 1960. to only $896 million as of May 30 of this year. That is a situation which certainly should be taken into consideration by the Senate. We still have great capacity for overproduction. and producers will have to use that capacity. if our ability to pay them to remove it from production is curtailed. We still have great conservation needs. to protect our land to provide clean water. to lessen flood risk or damage. to combat air pollution. to provide open space for recreation. and to meet many other needs of our people. If our ability to pay the amounts needed for these purposes is curtailed. these needs of our people will not be met. The damage to our land. water. and citizens could be irreparable. Our objective for years has been to preserve and protect the family farm. If our ability to pay larger farmers for taking land out of production is curtailed. we will have to look to smaller farmers for the needed production adjustment. If we succeed in this. we may find that many of the smaller operators have reduced their production to such an extent that it is not economic to operate the remainder. We may then find ourselves encouraging them to find other employment and eventually to leave the farm.

By getting the subsidies. the farmer can produce and sell to the mills for less than the cost of production. For 2 years this subsidy went to the manufacturers. and they did not like being named as getting the subsidy. They got it transferred as a charge against the farmer. I am referring primarily to cotton. which was the major item involved. When the mills got the subsidy. they were then required to pay the farmer the full cost of production for a crop. The subsidy then got transferred to the farmer. So the producer now gets charged for these millions of dollars of subsidies. and the two returns combined are often less than the cost of production. Because of that. this subsidy is probably warranted. However. it ought to be charged straight to the consumer or the manufacturer. rather than to the producers. I realize that the textile mills are very important in the Senate. and they are very important in the national economy. too. I feel that a subsidy to the consumer is warranted in order to compete with the foreign manufacturers. But let us put our subsidies where they belong. It might have been 5 or 6 years ago that an analysis was made by the Department of Agriculture. and it was found that probably half of the $6 billion of appropriations to agriculture was not a subsidy to agriculture. but was a subsidy to the consumers of this country.

We went to the White House. as a matter of fact I personally went to the White House. I said that the differential should be made up at the point of entry. And we were told very flatly that if we did that. the importing countries abroad would stop buying American cotton and. in order to meet the world price. we had to sell this cotton 8.5 cents cheaper than the American manufacturer was buying it. I say it would be better the other way. But we have tried it and tried it and tried it and never even got to first base. So this was the only alternative that was left to us. If this is changed. it would put us back where we were. We were at a disadvantage in maintaining American jobs. and that is what it amounts to. One thousand American textile mills have been closed in this country in the last 10 years. when we have been going up astronomically in the gross national product. when we have made more profits than ever before. Yet. these mills are closing down in Maine. in Massachusetts. in Rhode Island. and now they are even beginning to close down in the South.

Once again he is in the forefront with regard to matters concerning the public interest. The Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee of which I am chairman conducted hearings earlier this year on the competitive aspects of oil shale development. The Senate Interior Committee also held hearings with respect to the Department of the Interiors proposed oil shale program. As a result of these hearings. I. for one. was convinced that the proposed program by the Department of the Interior may have had the effect of aiding in the monopolization of the oil shale deposits by the major oil companies. The Secretary of the Interior has since announced that a new study of the program is in process and should be completed in January 1968. In the meantime the old program has been held in abeyance and not put into effect. I have not cosponsored the bill introduced by the senior Senator from Wisconsin. It is not because I believe that this bill does not represent one very sound approach to the problem. However. as chairman of a subcommittee which has had an interest in this area. I requested the Secretary of the Interior to reconsider the Departments position on this matter. This is being done and I believe. therefore. that it would be premature for me to cosponsor legislation before this task is completed and we have had an opportunity to analyze the new program. However. once again I want to compliment the senior Senator from Wisconsin for his interest in this most important subject.",

In every phase of this Nations development the blight of oppressive discrimination has been against women. It is a fact that women were given political rights in only half of the sovereign countries of the world when the United Nations Charter was formally signed. Sad to say. the United States--where the equality of women in political matters was established by the Constitutionhas so far failed to ratify the United Nations Convention on Political Rights of Women. It was more than 4 years ago that President John Fitzgerald Kennedy sent this treaty to the Senate. seeking ratification. We ignored this assignment. preferring to remain mute on this vital issue of our time. I point out the tremendously important contributions by women to this Nation. Women today serve as ambassadors. Members of Congress. as scientistsproving the value of the full equality of women. It is my genuine hope that the Senate CXIII2239---Part 26 will ratify the Convention on the Political Rights of Women and join such countries as Japan. India. China. Nigeria. Lebanon. Thailand. Turkey. Pakistan. and the 46 other nations already listed as signatories to this treaty. It is time for this Nation to address itself to these issues and demonstrate to mankind its disenchantment with all forms of discrimination. We have a deep responsibility under our Constitution. It is our task to complement the President in the matter of this Nations treatymaking process. Our system of checks and balances provides for twothirds of the Senate to give its advice and consent to all treaties before the President can ratify them on behalf of this country.",

Lithuanian Independence Day. is being commemorated and that we should do everything we can to sustain the hope for freedom of these people who have been so long submerged and held enslaved in the Communist bloc. It has been 50 years since the declaration of Lithuanian independence. Subjugated by successive predatory neighbors. the Lithuanians retain the hope of selfdetermination. The history of their struggle in this century is one of a frustrated desire for freedom and selfdetermination in the face of overwhelming odds. After 120 years of subjugation to Russia and occupation by the Germans during World War I. the Lithuanian people declared the \"establishment of an independent Lithuania\" on February 16. 1918. Yet. by the end of that year. the Soviet Union had invaded their territory. Lithuania fought back and. though stripped of part of Its territory. succeeded in gaining recognition from the Soviet Union as a sovereign state in 1920. The hardwon independence of Lithuanian people was short lived. In 1940. Soviet troops occupied the country and annexed it to the Soviet Union. When war broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union the following year. Lithuania fell under Nazi domination until in 1944 when Lithuania was again forcefully subjugated by the Soviet Army. Mr. President for 7 years. the Lithuanian people struggled to liberate their land. During the struggle. 30.000 Lithuanians died for their cause. and hundreds of thousands were deported to the Soviet Union. where they died wholesale in forced labor camps. But the Lithuanian people continue to yearn for freedom and the establishment of a truly independent Lithuanian state. Mr. President. we in the United States. who have consistently supported the principle of selfdetermination should also join our voices to commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the declaration of Lithuanian independence. to demonstrate our sincere hope that the love of liberty. so long repressed in Lithuania. will surely prevail.",

The situation was brought to light by the attorney general of Maryland. the Honorable Francis B.

Many of the complaints currently received in the consumer protection division come from military personnel stationed at Fort George G. Meade. and involve deceptive advertising and questionable business practices around that base. In response to these complaints. the consumer protection division has established a regular service of sending investigators to Fort Meade once a month to investigate complaints from servicemen. The service has been an overwhelming success. Many of the complaints have turned out to be validservicemen at Fort Meade have been proven justified In feeling that they and their families are often the victims of deceptive advertising and fraudulent practices. In addition. legal assistance officers at Fort Meade now feel that they have an outlet for the many consumer complaints they receive. Through the consumer protection division. they now have a way to get action. In the words of one legal assistance officer. \"We are beginning to feel more like lawyers and less like chaplains.\" Mr. President. it seems to me that the consumer protection division of the Maryland attorney generals office has set an example that should be heeded by every State in the Union. It is important that servicemen. no matter what State they come from. be given protection against consumer frauds by some agency of the State in which they are stationed. Just like everyone else. servicemen and their families need someone to turn to for help with their consumer problems. Furthermore. servicemen need help fast. before they get transferred to another area. It occurs to me that perhaps. until now. the serviceman stationed on a base outside his home State has been the forgotten man in the crusade to give better protection to the American consumer. I congratulate the attorney general of Maryland on the bold initiative he has taken to recognize the legitimate consumer protection needs of servicemen. and on his forthright approach to remedying those needs.",

The objective of this bill was to eliminate a widespread practice in government which we have labeled \"trial by government publicity.\" Shortly after our bill was introduced. the Federal Trade Commission instituted a change in their press release policy. When the FTC issues a press release announcing that a complaint has been filed. the press release contains the following statement: A complaint is issued whenever the Commission has found \"reason to believe\" that the law has been violated and that a proceeding is in the public interest. It is emphasized that the issuance of a complaint simply marks the initiation of a formal proceeding in which the charges in the complaint will be ruled upon after a hearing and on the record. The issuance of a complaint does not indicate or reflect any adjudication of the matters charged. A recent issue of the Wall Street Journal contains an article commenting on an FTC complaint against Koppers Co. The merits of this case will be determined at a subsequent hearing before the Federal Trade Commission. neither the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure nor its chairman have any interest in its outcome. What is of interest to us. however. is the fairness with which this issue has been handled by the FTC. The third paragraph of the Journal article specifically states that \"issuance by the FTC of a complaint means that the Commission. after an investigation by its staff. has found reason to believe that the law was violated.\" The Journal also reports that \"the charges dont constitute a finding that Koppers violated the law.\" The Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure intends to hold hearings on S. 924. In the meantime. we believe the FTC is to be commended for the lead it has taken in trying to present a fair and accurate picture in the releases which it issues. I ask unanimous consent to insert the Journal article at this point in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. James Reston. in his always illuminating column. was particularly perceptive the other day when he discussed the Vietnam war and the case for a tax increase. He calls it the moral argument for raising taxes. I was most impressed by this article. and I would like to share it with my colleagues. We are engaged in a most important and at the same time costly war in Vietnam. Many of our young men are making the difficult sacrifice of fighting this war under the most unpleasant of circumstances. Others. tragically. have made the supreme sacrifice and their loved ones will never forget them or what they have done there. Yesterday I delivered the eulogy at the funeral of a young marine who was recently killed in Vietnam. This boy meant a great deal to me. I will not soon forget the fact or significance of his great sacrifice. and it will surely live with his family forever. Very few demands have been made upon the general population in connection with the war in Vietnam. Yet when it became known some time ago that a tax increase might be necessary this year to help defray the enormous expense of this war. a tremendous hue and cry went up which reverberated against all corners of our land. Reston writes: No nation ever fought such a vicious war in the midst of such sacrifice by some of its people and so little sacrifice by the rest. The American people are not indifferent to this spectacular contrast between the men at the front and the people at home. though they know the facts more than they feel the hurt in the heart. I commend Mr. Reston for his brilliant analysis in the hope that more of us may gain the perspective that he has demonstrated in this column. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the article mentioned above be inserted in the RECORD at this point.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. just a cursory review of the events leading up to the present consideration of a new Panama Canal treaty will provide an insight into how the present situation came about. On January 910. 1964. riots broke out along the borders of the Panama Canal Zone which were quelled by U.S. Army Forces stationed in the Canal Zone. The Government of Panama broke relations with the United States and filed a charge of aggression with the OAS. During the OAS investigation Ambassador to the OAS. Ellsworth Bunker charged that mobs \"infiltrated and led by extremists. including persons trained in Communist countries.\" assaulted the U.S.-controlled Canal Zone. Ambassador Bunker also stated that the United States was ready to reconsider all United StatesPanamanian issues. \"including those arising from the canal and from the treaties relating to it.\" An Associated Press release noted that: This was the first time the United States included \"treaties\" in saying what subjects it would discuss in the 22dayold canal crisis. This concession was about 2 weeks after President Johnsonwas reported by the Washington Star. of January 14. to have declared: The United States cannot allow the security of the Panama Canal to be Imperiled. We have a recognized obligation to operate the canal efficiently and securely and we intend to honor that obligation in the interest of all who depend on it. On February 23. President Chiari. appearing on the television program. \"Issues and Answers.\" stated that unless a new treaty was worked out. further and more violent demonstrations like those in January were inevitable. On September 24. 1965. President Johnson issued a statement on the Panama Canal to the effect that the treaty which has governed the relationship between the U.S. Government and the Republic of Panama since 1903 would be abrogated. He also announced plans for a new treaty. which would effectively recognize Panamas sovereignty over the Canal Zone and provide for that nations political. economic. and social integration of the canal operation. The American Security Council. in its Washington Report of July 17. has raised some very pertinent points concerning the proposed treaty. The author of this report. associate editor Anthony Harrigan. emphasizes the pitfalls inherent in any agreement whereby U.S. control of the Canal is relinquished. I include it in the RECORD at this point:",

Most interesting coverage has been given Mr. Otto Otepkas long postponed hearings by the Government Employees Exchange newspaper. A careful reading of these reports leads to the conclusion that an appalling set of circumstances is involved. For example. the public is asked to accept thatThe mind of John F. Reilly. former State Department Deputy Under Secretary of State for Security. would go completely blank on the question of wiretapping Mr. Otepkas telephone and bugging his room. The State Department inadvertently or otherwise erased recordings highly material to Mr. Otepkas case and recognized as such 3 years ago. The State Department classified the transcript of the Otepka hearings over his objection and In the face of admissions that the only documents used in the hearings had been published. The State Department refused to release transcripts of the Otepka hearings in the face of the Freedom of Information Act. now public law.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. here is the text of a telegram I sent today to President Johnson regarding M16 rifle production: You recently urged the Congress to act immediately to halt a nationwide rail strike. citing the adverse effect of such a strike on the war effort in Vietnam. The strike at Colt Industries. which has halted all production of M16 rifles so badly needed by allied forces in Vietnam. has actually had an adverse Impact on our troops more immediate and more direct than the shortlived rail strike. Therefore. I respectfully urge that you ask the court to invoke the 80day backtowork provisions of the TaftHartley Act in order to restore full production of the vitally needed M16. Eighty days will of course pass quickly. but this period of time is sufficient to equip fully 80 battalions of combat troops with the improved M16 rifles. The Hartford. Conn.. plant is the sole producer of the M16 rifle and it is also the sole assembly point for the improvements so badly needed for M16 rifles already in use. Production from Colts already overstrained facilities has not been and is not sufficient to meet all demands by U.S. and allied troops in Vietnam and the situation is made even worse by the strike. Here we are. in the midst of a war in which more than 11.000 American men have been killed. Yet the sole producer of the single. most vitally needed weapon for combat is engaged in a labor conflict with its union. resulting in a strike that cripples our war effort and endangers the lives of countless American men. Because of Colts already overtaxed facilities existing before the strike its ability to supply adequately our forces in Vietnam. even at peak production. was questionable. As a result of this situation Marines are only now getting the last of their allotment. South Koreans and rear area U.S. troops have not yet been supplied and South Vietnamese forces. who have long begged for the gun. still have only a meager 12.000 of the weapon. with no immediate prospect of getting more. This production gap that can never be closed under normal circumstances is now made intolerable by the strike. Each day the strike continues undoubtedly some casualties can be traced to the production stoppage.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. because the 1967 Pop Warner AllAmerica Team of Little Scholars will be visiting Washington tomorrow. this is a particularly fitting occasion for me to again call to the attention of my colleagues the fine work of Pop Warner Junior League Football. You will recall that on the opening day of this session I introduced H.R. 50. a bill to grant a congressional charter to the Pop Warner organization. Since that time similar legislation has been introduced by 21 of our cblleagues in the House and seven Members of the Senate. I urge each of my colleagues to become familiar with the fine work of Pop Warner Junior League Football and to consider joining me in sponsoring this legislative recognition of the contribution it is making to the wellbeing of our youth. This league. which Is the oldest and largest boys football league in the country. was founded in Philadelphia in 1929 by Joseph J. Tomlin. the great Swarthmore lineman. Then. as now. the purpose of the organization was to bring youths closer together through a common interest in scholarship. athletic competition. and fellowship. Pop Warner football has been enthusiastically received everywhere that it has been introduced across the Nation. The growth of the league in my home town of Rochester. N.Y.. is typical of the growth that has occurred wherever teams have been organized. Since its inception in Rochester just over 4 years ago. Pop Warner football has grown from a single team to 10 teams with 350 boys participating. In addition. the Commissioner In Rochester. Mr. Joseph P. Miller. reports that there are many more boys awaiting the opportunity to join one of the local teams. Those young men on the AllAmerica team who will be visiting Washington tomorrow exemplify the ideals of Pop Warner football. These boys were chosen on the basis of their scholastic achievement. participation in extracurricular and civic activities. and their performance on the Pop Warner grid squads. I am particularly pleased by the fact that two Rochester area youths. one of whom is my constituent. have earned berths on the AllAmerica team. I extend my warmest congratulations to Richard Renzi of the Irondequolt. N.Y. \"Vikings.\" Dennis Damaschke of the Greece. N.Y. \"Chargers.\" and the other 30 members of the AllAmerica team.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is hardly news that the job of being President of the United States is seldom an easy one. But I do think it is useful for the American people to reflect every so often about the burdens carried by the man who holds this office. President Johnson has never complained about the abuse hurled in his direction. It is sad. but true. that the viciousness of some of these personal attacks is perhaps unprecedented in Jly 19. 1967 American history. And it is equally true that this criticism is grossly unfair. In a recent editorial. the San Antonio News points out that President Johnson is often condemned by his critics \"for acting too hastily or not quickly enough. for doing too much or too little. for being too vague or too precise.\" We in Congress know the truth of this observation. We. too. have our critics and we are also criticized in a similar fashion on many issues. But while the News observes philosophically that the President could scarcely be blamed if he decided to retire to his ranch. those of us who know Lyndon Johnson know that he will not let his critics get him down. The President does not need our sympathynor does he ask for it. But he could use a stronger dose of understanding from us all. I believe we should all begin with the correct premise that President Johnson is trying his best to do what is right for the American people. We may not always agree with each and every policy of his administration. But we must grant to the President and his advisers the benefit of our conviction that they are sincere. devoted. and patriotic Americans who are dedicated to the task of improving the quality of American life and the chance for a peaceful and progressive world community. Criticism. fair and unfair. is part and parcel of the office of the Presidency. But so is trust and respect from friends and critics alike. This fact. I believe. is overlooked only at the expense of the Nations welfare and unity.

Although I was with the minority. the bill did pass by a vote of 268 to 150. I have listened both today and yesterday to a number of Members demanding increases in the appropriation bill. but it seems unreasonable for us one week to vote to reduce the budget by $6 billion and to pass a bill today which appropriates $3 billion more than the amount included in appropriations for the current year. The table on page 2 of the report shows the amount of increases for the various departments and agencies covered by this present bill. You will note that there is an additional $100 million for the Office of Economic Opportunity even though Senate hearings indicate that poverty funds have recently been used for the purchase of guns for gang warfare and to assist participants in riots and civil disorders. It just seems inconsistent to me to talk about a fiscal crisis. to deplore the continuous Federal deficit. and then to increase funds for Government agencies in the first appropriation bill to come before the House after the taxincrease spendingcut bill and to increase this spending over last year by more than $3 billion.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the Bilingual Education Act is one of our most prorising new educational programs. Enacted less than a year ago as title VII. of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. it authorizes programs to meet the special needs of children of limited Englishspeaking ability. The need for such legislation became overwhelmingly apparent in the course of the hearings which preceded the passage of this act. There are over 3 million children in these United States who do not speak English as their mother tongue. Their limited ability to communicate with their teachers and classmates constitutes a severe educational handicap which many of them are never able to overcome. It has been proven in several experiments that bilingual education. in which two languages are used as the medium of instruction. can overcome this handicap. Throughout the Nation young people of MexicanAmerican. Indian. FrenchCanadian. Puerto Rican. and Portuguese descent are being deprived of their right to an equal opportunity because of language barriers which we now have the power to remove. The Bilingual Education Act authorized $30 million for fiscal year 1969 to begin work on removing these barriers. Due to the economic difficulties in which we find ourselves. however. the President in his budget request recommended an appropriation of only $5 milliona relatively small sum. but enough to insure that abeginning would at least be made. The appropriations bill we considered yesterday. however. proposed no funds whatsoever for bilingual education. In the floor debate on this bill. the gentleman from California offered an amendment which would have restored the $5 million requested by the President. This amendment was defeated by only one vote. I strongly support funding of the Bilingual Education Act. and I deplore the rejection of Mr. COHELANS amendment yesterday. In our quest for economy we may well be banrupting the Nations future store of human resources. I suggest that unless we set our sights on goals which include social as well as economic considerations. the plight of our educationally disadvantaged youth can only grow worse.",

I do not agree to and have never agreed to the cut in title I funds for the ESEA program. There is no possible defense for the unwarranted reductions in cancer research. research in heart disease. in the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolical Diseases or any program of the Public Health Service.

In an effort to correct the false impressions caused by this pamphlet. I am enclosing a letter I have sent to many of my constituents who have contacted me on this subject: SErrMBEa 27. 1968. DEAR FRIEND: Thank you for your letter of recent date in which you express concern over the enactment of H.R. 5710. From time to time I have received similar communications as a result of a flyer now being circulated in some areas about this bill. Upon consulting with Social Security Commissioner Robert Ball. I learned that the circular being passed around was traced to a private citizen who explained that he had been misled. As a member of Congress who has worked for and supported Social Security legislation for many years. I am greatly disturbed by these reports. which are totally false. Therefore. I would like to clarify this issue with the facts of the case. and I hope you will communicate my views to your membership. H.R. 5710. though not enacted as framed. included provisions that were subsequently Incorporated Into H.R. 12080. and later enacted into law as the Social Security Amendments of 1967. These are the amendments that increased social security benefits beginning with checks payable in March 1968 and improved social security In many other ways. Neither H.R. 5710 nor H.R. 12080 would have done what the flyer claims. Nothing whatever in either bill provided for channeling social security contributions into public assistance (welfare) programs. or for allowing social security administrators to decide what amount of benefits an individual is to get based on what they think his need is. Neither bill proposed any change In the longestablished provisions of the social security law which require that each beneficiary be",

The guns were marked for shipment to Dar es Salaam and Burundi but--at the time of offloadingU.S. Consulate officials said they were really destined for South America. The officials said then that the guns were to be held in bond in Durban for later shipment to America. But today. neither the agents for the freighter Ruth Lykes. which brought the guns to Durban. nor the United States Consulate in Durban. would comment on their whereabouts. A source in the U.S. Consulate did say. however. that the guns had left Durban.",

George Wallace made a downright misstatement of fact in his speech this week before the National Press Club when he declared there had been no difference between the foreign policies of the Democratic and Republican Party. I should like to correct the record. As Frank Kluckhohn points out in his new book \"The Man Who Kept the Peace.\" which has an excellent introduction by Senator KARL MUNDT of the Foreign Relations Committee of the other body: Under Dulles. not one American soldier died. Not one foot of ground was lost to the Red Russians or Chinese. Austria came out from under the Iron Curtain and the Soviet Union was forced to turn from supporting armed adventures. There was no Bay of Pigs. no U.S.S. Pueblo. no Cuban missile crisis. no Vietnam. Mr. Kluckhohn points out that this \"golden era\" came \"between the Korean war with its 33.000 American dead and 103.000 wounded and Vietnam with its 25.000 dead and 110.000 wounded.\" I would suggest it is time George Wallace learns the facts and stops selling fallacies about an important era of American affairs in which. obviously. he is abysmally ignorant.",

For example. if the people of Louisiana develop those resources. Louisiana is entitled to ask for some consideration for that reason. whether they get any or not. If the people of some other State develop those resources. they are entitled to ask for consideration. or they are entitled to say that when that area is developed and resources are extracted from it. either all or some part of those resources should be directed to repairing the damage that Is done in extracting those resources. such as the pollution of the water and the destruction of the potential of that area to produce oysters. shrimp. or other marine life.

However. we felt. in order to have proper administration of the shelf. that where there was no Federal law that was applicable in a particular situation the law of the adjoining State should be applicable. The Congress had in mind the fact that previous bills had been introduced in Congress which would have given to the States not only lands within the 3mile limit or historic boundary. but lands many. many miles beyond State boundaries. In some instances. State claims went out 27 miles. and in others to the outer edge of the outer shelf. So Congress wanted to make clear that nothing in the Outer Continental Shelf Act was to be construed as a basis for further claim to the land beyond that contained in the first socalled tidelands bill we had passed. that is. the Submerged Lands Act.

They said the Federal Government had a \"paramount interest.\" and the States came back and asked for quitclaims of that paramount interest. not a gift of the lands. because the lands were not held. even by Supreme Court decisions. to be the property of the Federal Government. The reason I bring up that point is that the decision of the Supreme Court in the California case had made it very clear that if the rules of laches. estoppel. and the statute of limitations had applied against the Federal Government. the courts ruling could not be as was the majority holding in the California case. They all recognized the fact there had been a long course of dealings. over a hundred years. under which the Federal Government had. in the course of many instances. recognized State title in those lands. Senators will find that in the opinion. and particularly the opinion in the California case. it was freely stated that if the laws of laches. estoppel. and the statute of limitations had applied against the Federal Government. as they would apply against an ordinary individual. there would be no question of the right of the States to maintain their own paramount interest and title in the submerged lands. So the purpose of the Submerged Lands Act was to. in effect. quitclaim back to the States that strip of land so as toif one can say this in so many wordsadmit that the Federal Government should have been subject to the rules of laches. estoppel. and the statute of limitations. and that the long established rule of dealings between the Federal Government and the State government would be recognized. and that that strip of land would be quitclaimed back to the States.

I speak now about the demands being made by the building craftsmen unions for increased hourly wage rates of over 40 percent in a 3year period.

That ik an increase of approximately 40 percent. Carpenters are receiving $5.61 an hour. They are asking for a 3year increase of $2.30 an hour. That again is an increase of approximately 40 percent in the 3year period. The iron workers present hourly wage rate is $5.60. They are asking for a $2.30 an hour increase. I have received communications from citizens residing in the Cleveland area who point out the grave impact that this proposed increase will have on the ability of the ordinary householder to buy or maintain a home. Until about 2 years ago. the national policy was that wage increases should correspond to the increased ability of the worker to produce. but that in no event should they exceed 3.5 percent yearly. In th2 present situation. if these workers were to receive a 40percent increase in a period of 3 years. the increase would be 13.5 percent a year.

    "speech": "Mr. President. for the last 5 years on the Senate floor I have been hearing discussions concerning the dangers of inflation and how the increased cost of purchases would affect the ability of the retired individual to buy goods and services. I have heard discussions of how inflation will conflict with the judgment that the retiree made 10 years ago when he said: \"I will get my pension. I will get my retirement pay. I will be able to sustain myself in my old age.\" The retiree will not have a chance in the world to sustain himself if the cost of labor in the building industry is to increase 40 percent. Such an increase would have an impact on the cost of all goods that the citizens must buy. The Inevitable result would be inflation. It is simply inescapable. The Federal Government is doing nothing about the situation. The Labor Department is silent. The Department of Transportation. which is in charge of the Bureau of Public Roads. is doing nothing. The Government in general is indifferent. No buyer of the services rendered by the building craftsman buys in larger quantities than does the Government. The Government Is providing money to build highways and homes for the aged. and homes for the poor. schools and libraries and other public buildings. It is the Federal Government which pays the price. Yet. the Government remains silent when demands for a 40percent increase in wages over a period of 3 years are being made. Mr. President. first there is an increase in wages. then an increase in prices. There is no end to the spiral of the increase in the cost of goods. I call upon the Government. especially the Department of Labor. the Department of Housing and Urban Development. the Bureau of Public Roads. and every other agency concerned with the spending of Government money on public projects to look into this matter and take such action as will be proper and just. and approve justifiable wage increases. but repudiate those that are completely out of line. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I Invite the attention of Senators to a recent speech delivered by Theodore Sorensen on the efforts of the oneman. 10vote advocates to call a constitutional convention. Mr. Sorensen forcefully expresses his view that Congress would be bound by petitions submitted by 34 State legislatures calling for a constitutional convention on reapportionment. He goes on to say that such a convention would not be limited to apportionment alone. but could also take up such issues as the abolition of the Income tax. the election of the Supreme Court. a mandatory balanced budget. and prayer in our public schools. In view of the reactionary mood Mr. Sorensen senses in this country. he feels that such actions would be very likely. However. unlike many prophets of doom and gloom. Mr. Sorensen suggests an answer to this disturbing problem. He proposes that Congress enact legislation implementing the constitutional provision calling on the Congress to convene a constitutional convention upon the application of twothirds of the States. Such legislation. he suggests. could provide that applications from twothirds of the States must be re.. ceived in the same Congress. that such a convention shall be apportioned by Congress on a population basis. and that all applications shall be officially transmitted to the Vice President and the Speaker of the House to avoid future surprise developments. Although I do not agree with all of the remarks Mr. Sorensen makes in his speech.

The jerrybuilt case the Federal Aviation Administration has put together in favor of the SST is exposed for what it is: a collection of superficial. illconsidered. poorly thought out. and. in some instances. publicbedamned arguments that. in sum. provide an extremely poor basis for plunging into a project that. in the end. could cost the American people as much as $4 billion. I agree with the statement made by George W. Hilton.

Our estimate of occupancy rate for those beds in the District would be higher than the national average. and part of this is related to the fact some 40 percent of the beds are occupied by residents outside the District of Columbia. So it certainly would seem to me that there is some basis for the statement being made by the gentleman from Virginia that there were some 40 percent of the beds occupied by residents outside of the District. based on the testimony of Dr. Grant. I might say also parenthetically that it seems to me that in most of our metropolitan areas it is reasonable to expect residents from outside the immediate metropolitan area will utilize hospital facilities in the city. I know in my own district. the 36th District of New York. we have large metropolitan hospitals in the Rochester area. and that these facilities are used by people from outside the county and outside the city. As a matter of fact. Mr. Speaker. I have been trying very hard to get an additional hospital in one of the rural areas In my district. and they will not permit the construction of the hospital because they say that these people should 22.613 be handled by the larger metropolitan area. So. Mr. Speaker. it seems to me that this is part of the facts of life insofar as medical facilities are concerned. namely. that the larger hospitals in the metropolitan centers are so constructed and staffed that they can service not only the immediate area. but also those people outside of the area. One additional point that was made by the gentleman from Virginia which I believe is very important is that these people who come in from the outside to the metropolitan area are paying their way. They are not welfare patients. but they are paying their way.

I was shocked to learn of an incredible U.S. State Department proposal that $26 million in debts which Poland owes the United States for food shipments should not be repaid to the United States in dollars. but in Polish currency to be spent In Poland. I find It inconceivable that at a time when Communistruled Poland is openly supporting and assisting the Hanoi regime In North Vietnam. our Government can consider what amounts to simply giving that nation millions of dollars. Late last year a Hamburg newspaper dispatch noted that on one side of the harbor of Stettin. Poland. American wheat was being unloaded. while on the other side of that same harbor weapons to be used against American soldiers were loaded. Only a week ago it was reported In the press that Cuba and Poland have signed a trade agreement by which Poland will supply food. consumer goods. and industrial and agricultural machinery to Cuba In exchange for Cuban sugar. rum. and minerals. If the State Departments proposal is accepted. it will mean that our supplies of food to Poland will allow Poland to supply food to Cuba. Last June I introduced legislation to keep U.S. dollars from going to Castro via the United Nations Special Funddollars which would have been used for the training of Communist youths in electronics. radar. and military communications only 90 miles from our shores. I am completely opposed to this new State Department proposal which would. in effect. subsidize Polish shipments of industrial materials and goods to Cuba. As long as Polish support is contributing to the export of Cuban communism to the Western Hemisphere and to the deaths of our servicemen in Vietnam.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 104 years ago. on January 22. 1863. the people of Poland revolted against the autocratic rule of Czarist Russia. Although they fought heroically against far superior manpower. they failed. but the people of Poland persevered and finally achieved their Independence in 1918. This historic event has special significance at the present time because of the current Communist dictatorship of the Soviet Union. which is substantially more diabolical than the Czarist regime. The Soviet Union actually holds Poland in bondage through the Communist regime which Russian military forces installed at the close of World War II. On this. the 104th anniversary of the Polish struggle for freedom against the Czars. we encourage the brave people of Poland to remember that the defeat of that year was ultimately rewarded in independence. thus demonstrating the perseverance of the Polish people and the righteousness of their cause. Certainly. -this historic perseverance and quest for freedom will again produce a government based on the true wishes of the Polish people. The continued belligerence of the Communist regime against the Catholic Church has a historic parallel in the persecution which the oppressors of Poland pressed against the faith of the Poles in the 19th century. It is especially ironic that the present State Department policy is to make trade and political concessions to the Warsaw regime. thus directly sustaining it in power. It would be a far more practical thing to apply pressure that we have at our disposal to bring about an improvement in the standard of living of the Polish people and not to coexist with the dictators in Warsaw until they grant religious and political freedom to the Polish people. I should also mention. Mr. Speaker. that the regime that persecutes the Polish people is supporting the North Vietnamese aggression in South Vietnam.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there Is a growing realization that high interest charges place an inordinate burden on the poor of this Nation. The theory that high interest rates are a tax on the poor is becoming accepted as a fact. Dr. David Caplovitz. of Columbia University. has done a brilliant job of describing this phenomenon in his book. \"The Poor Pay More.\" This is an excellent description of the cruel toll that high interest credit takes from the poverty stricken. Last Saturday. Dr. Caplovitz participated in the New York Consumer Assembly at the StatlerHilton Hotel in New York City. Dr. Caplovitz discussed \"Consumer Problems of the Poor\" and once again stressed the problems of high interest rates. Many. of course. are prone to lay the blame for high interest charges and bad credit practices on the loan shark and the sharppractice finance company. The practices of these outfits are badvery badbut as Dr. Caplovitz points out. it is the respectable banking community which ultimately provides the funds for such activities. This paragraph from Dr. Caplovitz remarks to the New York Consumer Assembly is particularly significant on this point: Much more despicable. I think are the flybynight companies which send their canvassers into the ghetto to sell such expensive commodities as encyclopedias. pots and pans. deep freezers and vacuum cleaners. These companies specialize in sharp practices. Once they make their dishonest sales. they quickly sell their paper to finance companies and benefit from the immunity that the law now gives them from further responsibility for the sale. And I should point out that these disreputable companies could not long survive without the collusion of the equally disreputable finance companies and banks which buy their paper. These financial institutions must share the blame for the exploitation of the poor. for they know all too well that they are buying \"bad\" paper. that is. dishonestly obtained contracts. and yet they do so anyway. And when we ask the further question of where the finance companies get the funds that they need to operate. we soon discover that they often borrow from highly respectable banks. Thus. the socalled respectable financial community is also a party to the exploitation of the poor. I place the text of Dr. Caplovitz remarks in the RECORD:",

That is my only comment. I desired to call that to the attention of the Senator. I believe it is very important.",

His emphasis on the fact that the river does not flow with enough water to meet all the commitments that legally have been placed against the river indicates that there must be a degree of cooperation in the management of the river. and there must also be immediate and urgent effort made to augment the flow of the river. so that those legal commitments can be met. I expect to spend some time discussing this matter during the course of the debate on the bill. But I believe that what the Senator from California has placed before the Senate today will provide the basis for pause on the part of Senators in thinking about this great problem. and in understanding that It is folly to attack a regionaleven a nationalproblem on a small. piecemeal basis. which leaves hanging unsolved the great overreaching problem. We should broaden our view and take the wider approach at this time. as the Senator from California has so clearly set forth. I have served with the Senator for 9 years on the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. We have worked on many water projects all over the countrysome in my State. some in his State. some. in other Statesand I believe that we have been in agreement 99 percent of the time.

The value of the Grand Canyon to this Nation was well stated by the English author J. B. Priestley. in 1937: I have heard rumors of visitors (to the Grand Canyon) who were disappointed. The same people will be disappointed at the Day of Judgment. In fact. the Grand Canyon is a sort of landscape Day of Judgment. It is not a showplace. a beauty spot. but a revelation. The Colorado River. which is powerful. turbulent. and so thick with silt that it is like a saw. made it with the help of the erosive forces of rain. frost. and wind. and some strange geological accidents. and all these together have been hard at work on it for the last seven or eight million years. It is the largest of the eighteen canyons of the Colorado River. is over two hundred miles long. has an average width of twelve miles. and is a good mile deep. It is the worlds supreme example of erosion. But this is not what it really is. It is. I repeat. a revelation. The Colorado River made it. but you feel when you are there that God gave the Colorado River its instructions. It is all Beethovens nine symphonies in stone and magic light. Even to remember that it is still there lifts up the heart. And Mr. Priestley concluded: Every member or officer of the Federal Government ought to remind himself with triumphant pride that he is on the staff of the Grand Canyon. Mr. President. I trust that when the time comes. and it must come soon. we will all be \"on the staff of the Grand Canyon.\" and that we can all at least fulfill the trust Theodore Roosevelt laid on us: I want to ask you to do one thing in connection with the Grand Canyon . . . leave it as it is. you cannot improve on it. The ages have been at work on it and man can only mar It . . . What you can do is keep It for your children. your childrens children and all who come after you.",

It would seem to me that there is no difference in having to work with those kinds of estimates. and in taking a 6 percent figure of that estimate In determining the borrowing ceiling. There are uncertainties in either event. but this does not compound or add to the uncertainties because it all stems from the problem of making up the estimate as far ahead as a year and a half. I do not think the amendment is really going to be helpful. Even if the amendment were adopted. there would still have to be an estimate because we still do not know for the fiscal year 1967 what the actual revenues will be until we come to June 30. 1967.

Conforming to the long practice. it provides for all activities except the appropriations for the other body. it is the custom to leave those for the decision of the Senate. It includes the House of Representatives. the Library of Congress. the Botanic Garden. the Architect of the Capitol. the Government Printing Office. and a number of items of a joint character between the two Houses such as joint committees. and so forth. And this year. the General Accounting Office appropriation is in this billwhich incidentally raises the total of the bill about $53 million above what it otherwise would be. and. in fact. the way the figures work out. leaving out the GAO. the bill total. in figures. would be roughly $3 million below the corresponding fiscal 1967 total.

As the sponsor of a proposal which would require motor vehicles to be equipped with tamperproof odometersmileage indicatorsI wish to bring this article to the particular attention of Senators. The article points out that after the implementation of strictly enforced odometer legislation in California prices for most used cars began to fall sharply while prices for lowmileage models remained steady or increased. This was a boon to the California consumer. but not so good for his neighbors in contiguous States. OutofState car wholesalers can come into California. buy highmileage used cars at a very cheap price. roll back the mileage indicator after the car has been transported out of California. and reap a huge profit as a result. California car dealers want the law repealed. They would prefer to roll back all mileage indicators to zero. As Consumer Reports indicates the dealer philosophy in this instance would have to be considered as \"a little knowledge is dangerous. Dont give em any.\" A viable and sensible alternative is a Federal law. If it can work in California. it can work in the country at large. Consequently I sincerely hope that the Committee on Commerce will have an opportunity to take action on my odometer legislation in the near future.

    "speech": "unlike the United States. Is almost self sufficient in raw materials. Yet they have one of the most modern merchant fleets in the world. and it is growing rapidly. If the present shipbuilding trend continues in a few years. Soviet Russia could have the worlds largest and most modern Merchant Marine. Further. there is a very fine line of distinction between the peaceful uses of a merchant ship and its wartime uses. In fact. this line Is nearly indistinguishable because the passenger ship. for example. lends itself to wartime transportation of troops. In the Cuban crisis. it was merchant shipping that took the missiles into Cuba and others that took them out. If we were to control the seas in wartime. then the Soviets would be confined to a limited area of the world. If they gain control of these oceans. then the reverse becomes true. They would control 95 per cent of the entire surface of the earth. Without materials from overseas. factories would close. businesses would shut down. jobs would be destroyedwe would be an \"isolated island\" inevitably to lose our freedom and way of life. These highly competitive efforts of the Soviet leadership represent a form of \"war\" of design and construction. of manpower and national resources. of money. of planning and organization. Its roots lie deep in national policy and purpose: first in the realization of how completely seapower is. and will be. involved in the security and political and economic wellbeing of the Soviet nation. Second. it reflects the determination of the Soviets to pay the price that a total dedication to supremacy of the seas demands of a major world power. . Third. it indicates a willingness to marsal resources in developing and refining a seapower program as a prime contribution to the nations overall progress in the world arena. The U.S.S.R. currently ranks sixth among the maritime nations In terms of dead weight tonnage. while the United States ranks fifth with about 16 million DWT. However. the Soviet target for 1980 is a fleet of 20 million dead weight tons and since World War II. the Soviets have acquired more than 1.000 newbuilt ships.

Fifteen men were rescued and hope faded for the remaining 10 men. In a desperate attempt to drain the flooded mine. large pumps were brought in which began pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of water from the mine. In mining accidents. rescue efforts never cease until all men or their bodies have been recovered. For 10 long days. rescue operations continued around the clock to reach flooded sections of the mine. Hope had been given up. by many. that the men could be found alive. Search teams pished their way into the depths of the mine as pumps sucked the water out. West Virginia Hillbilly Editor Jim Comstock told in moving prose of the finding of the lost men. who had survived for 10 days on only the food in their lunch buckets: This particular group. headed by Roy Simmons. had come to a place which was wadeable and they waded. Coming out on the other side on the lake. they saw fresh shoe tracks. And a dinner pail. They followed the tracks and they came to a tent made of brattice cloth .... Inside the tent. six men huddled. absorbing the bodily heat of the others. It was journeys end.

Introduced by my respected colleague. the Congressman from Alaska . the bill was incorporated into the measure the House will pass today. The bill before us establishes a one million dollar minimum allocation under section 2(a) which means that the vocational rehabilitation program in Wyoming would receive that amount in fiscal 1969. rather than the lesser amount of some $694.000 which was our allocation for fiscal 1968. This language is recognition of the fact that all States. regardless of their populations have certain minimum charges associated with the creation and administration of an effective vocational rehabilitation program. These costs are no less substantial for Wyoming. Alaska. Delaware. or Nevada. than for California or New York. I commend the Education and Labor Committee for incorporating this language into H.R. 16819. and my colleague. the gentleman from Alaska . for drafting the bill which is the basis for this amendment. Our smaller States and their people in need of vocational rehabilitation assistance have been well served by this action.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I most earnestly hope the House will speedily and overwhelmingly approve this measure before us. H.R. 16819. which is designed to strengthen the existing programs operating under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and expand the scope of rehabilitation services within the communities and States. In essence. vocational rehabilitation is a combination of services provided to a physically or mentally disabled person in order to prepare him for employment and productive useful living. Since the inception of our FederalState program of vocational rehabilitation. over 2 million handicapped persons have been guided and helped to a point of productive activity. Our most recent statistics show that in the fiscal year of 1967. over 170.000 disabled Americans were restored to more productive living. This whole program is certainly a worthwhile national endeavor. and the bill before us Is designed to strengthen the present FederalState programs and authorize three major additions which would set up special programs to let the Federal Department of Health. Education. and Welfare make contracts with business. industry. and commerce to place handicapped persons in competitive employment. provide new career opportunities for the handicapped. and provide work adjustment services to disabled as well as handicapped people. In brief. Mr. Speaker. this measure is a realistic effort. founded on past. valued experience. to marshal all the resources of Federal and State governments. in cooperation with business. industry. and commerce. to help handicapped Americans to achieve productive living and fully participate in the personal. social. and economic activities of their community. There is no question about the need for these programs. there is no question that the programs have been unusually effective in their operation. and there is no question that the results prove that the program has been a sound investment for the country. Therefore. I again urge that this bill be adopted without extended delay.",

This tragic midair collision brought sudden death to three youngsters. Ronnie Brawn. Yvonne Eleanor. and Robert Callan. who only moments before were enjoying a class recess outdoors. Out of the shadow of this tragedy has emerged the triumph that is Pacoima Memorial Lutheran Hospital. This great community health center serves as a memorial to those youngsters who died that day and further honors their broken bodies by embracing a concern for the whole of manphysical. mental. social. and spiritual. In its 6 years. the hospital has met the aroundtheclock emergency needs of the 32.466 persons in its area. It has developed special medical service departments. including a pulmonary function disease laboratory. a nuclear medicine department. inhalation therapy department. and a physical therapy department. Pacoima Lutheran Memorial Hospital has focused government and community resources on all aspects of mental health care. Prevention and education. as well as treatment are major activities in its new mental health center. The hospital has been serving the spiritual needs of its patients and personnel with its chaplain. 0. W. Mieger. and. under a mental health staffing grant. is developing a program to educate and train the spiritual leaders of the community in mental health. The staff of Pacoima Memorial Lutheran Hospital recognizes that the problem of sickness. disease. and accident is not selfcontained.

This past summer the hospital had three health care students surveying the Pacoima community to determine the availability. accessibility. and acceptability of Its services to the persons who need them.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have introduced legislation which would provide for the sharing of Federal taxes with the States and their local political subdivisions. I am hopeful that the House can take favorable action on thi. proposal in the near future as It represents a new direction for America which was mandated by the voters last November 8. The proposal would return 2.2 billion Federal dollars directly to State and local governments without Federal earmarking or control. The Presidents budget proposes an Increase of more than $2 billion in existing Federal grantinaid programs for the next fiscal year and a major cutback in these proposed expansions could be the start for an effective taxsharing plan. The bill would allocate 3 percent of Federal personal income tax revenue for tax sharing. The 17 poorest States would first receive 10 percent of the total funds as a form of equalization. The other 90 percent would then be divided among all States on the basis of population and a simple taxeffort ratio. Fortyfive percent of the funds allocated to a State would have to be passed on to local subdivisions. The other 55 percent would be spent in any way the State desired. States reducing taxes would continue to receive taxsharing funds. but in a comparably reduced amount. There are two unique features of this taxsharing proposal. First. at least 45 percent of the money would go to the local level for education and other municipal expenditures. Second. a new Council on Tax Sharing. with State representation. would administer the program to insure simplified distribution procedures and to preclude any Federal controls. The 10man bipartisan Council would be appointed by the President and five of them would be State Governors. As a further explanation. I would like to insert at this point in the RECORD a detailed discussion of the bills provisions which has been prepared by the initiator of this approach. the gentleman from New York [Mr. GOODELL3. who. in my opinion. has come up with the finest new taxsharing approach to meet the growing public problems of our State and local governments:",

He spoke of the need to Increase the benefits of our veterans and servicemen to an extent never before equaled. These recommendations. of course. speak of the growing and constant concern for those men dying in Vietnam and improves their rights for education. for compensation in the event of their being disabled. and in all other areas where veterans of prior wars have been recognized. But he asked morehe asked that our older veterans and their widows who are in need receive more pension. He asked for a costofliving increase for those in need who subsist on so little. In this connection. we have heard much In the past where social security has been increased and the pension benefit has been reduced because more social security counts as income in that program. What a contradiction this has been where a benevolent Congress acts to increase one Federal benefit and thus reduce another to the point where the pensioner takes home less money. The President tells us of his concern for this cause. He recognizes that his recent social security recommendations could create this situation and he has asked this Congress to see that this will not penalize the veteran. He has asked that a partial waiver of the increase in social security be permitted and thereby protect every pensioner from being reduced in their veterans pension rights. I am for the program submitted by the President. I am gratified that he has asked our help in this effort. As a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee. I will be proud to support the measures he proposes.",

Ike has maintained an active interest in affairs that concern his Nation and his communityhis counsel has been invaluable to our Nations leaders and to heads of peaceloving countries throughout the world.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there Is a dire shortage in this country of qualified hospital personnel below the professional leveltherapists. attendants. nurses aides. practical nursesin Federal hospitals. One means of helping alleviate this shortage is to make these jobs more attractive to prospective employees. At present. licensed practical nurses working in veterans hospitals are lumped by the Civil Service Commission in the same category as nonprofessional personnel and are listed as GS2. GS3. and GS4. The licensed practical nurses are not nonprofessional personnel. but are. in fact. subprofessional personnel. licensed to aid doctors and registered nurses in the professional care of patients. They have completed a training period of 1 year in a school of practical nursing and have obtained a State license. Very often these LPNs are expected to perform some duties on the same level as registered nurses. Mr. Speaker. I feel we are doing these people an injustice. And. in fact. we are doing ourselves an injustice. Therefore. I have today introduced a bill to amend the Classification and Wage Act under title 5 of the United States Code to categorize licensed practical nurses as subprofessional personnel and to elevate their pay level to GS4. GS5. and GS6. If we want quality care in our hospitals we are going to have to start paying for it. And the Federal Government has a responsibility to be a leader in this field. It is the first timid step in the muchneeded complete overhaul of our hospital pay structures. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on the editorial page of the InterCity News. under the date of October 3. appeared an editorial that contained some logic which is almost irrefutable. I wish to share this with my colleagues. Yesterday we approved the conference report of firearms legislation pertaining to long guns. While the record will show I supported the safe streets and omnibus crime bill containing some needed provisions for handguns. I firmly oppposed the socalled State Firearms Control Assistance Act which was a longgun control bill. On Wednesday. October 2. in the Extensions of Remarks section of the siderable length my stand on this bill. being H.R. 17735 passed by the House in July. and the same measure which was the subject of the conference report finally approved by the House yesterday. The editorial of the InterCity News points out that it wants no policetype surveillance of private citizens who may have to show reasonable cause why they want to purchase a gun. It continues on to argue that mortality statistics could be used to support the abolition of a great many things. including the bathtub because thousands of persons have been killed by falling in bathtubs. The same is true of an automobile. which is a lethal device that accounts for thousands of deaths every year. But who is going to be ridiculous enough to eliminate the bathtub or the automobile? Mr. Speaker. this article gets very close to the heart or center of the controversy over whether or not more firearms legislation is needed. The real problem is not firearms but criminals. Legislation should be directed against the criminal. with mandatory sentences and without parole or suspension of these sentences. Firearms are only an instrument of crime.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the course of deliberations by the Committee on Education and Labor on the Higher Education Amendments of 1968. it was brought to the attention of the Members that changes in draft deferment policy would result in substantial numbers of college graduates being drafted who had intended to enroll in graduate school and a widely predicted and criticized decline in graduate enrollments. Very soon thereafter. we received the telegrams and letters of dozens of college presidents. deans. and administrators. urging us to \"do something.\" At a hearing at which the Selective Service Director was the key witness. we learned that the anticipated impact on graduate school enrollments could be avoided or moderated entirely by Executive action. which was duly urged. No legislative response was either necessary or desirable. And no action was taken by the executive branch of government. Now we learn. thanks to the efforts of the Associated Press. that the harsh impact just never materialized. In a dispatch published on September 19. 1968. interviews with various school officials are reported. Though the reasons appear to vary from institution to institution. the general result has been that gross enrollment is about the same as before the changes in draft policy. In the absence of congressional or Executive action. it would appear that the universities have saved themselves. It may be true that more students who were bound for graduate school are now serving their Nation in the armed forces. but other qualified students have stepped forward to take up the slack in the education system. I am pleased to note that in some cases the slack is taken up by the admission of more women to graduate schools. The moral of the campus draft scare that never materialized seems to be that the Nations universities can adapt to new conditions and help themselves.

The annals of Poland have been fraught with tragedy. Sharing her borders with voracious neighbors. Poland has suffered the fate of partition and division throughout her history. at times having ceased to exist as a state. Her territory has consistently been coveted by more powerful states. and. more often than not. the balance of power has forced accession to demands upon her sovereignty. But because she has suffered. Poland has endured. and the ordeal of her passion has produced an uncommon number of gallant patriots. heroes whose fierce devotion to freedom and to Poland has earned for them lasting fame and honorin their own nation and throughout the world. One such Polish patriot was Casimir Pulaski. A nobleman by birth. he was forced to flee his homeland following his participation in an unsuccessful insurrection against foreign rule. His ardor for liberty could not be quenched. however. and finding himself homeless. he made his way to America in 1777. where he entered the service of General Washington. His heroic exploits in the Revolutionary War. until his death 2 years later. earned him the unstinting admiration and gratitude of Americans. who. like the Poles. had known the tyranny of foreign domination. Poland is still not free today. Her suffering yet continues.

Notwithstanding this fact we find that for the past 8 months the administration has been padding the public payroll at the rate of eight extra employees every 5 minutes. These 131.871 employees are in addition to the normal replacements for resignation. retirement. and so forth. and they are as follows: Month Employment Increase October -------------------------2 798. 2 24. 488 November 2.---------------------- 2 834.940 36. 728 December ----------------------- 2 842.528 7.588 January 1967 --------------------2 .848.249 5.721 February ------------------------ 2.864.626 16.377 March ....................... 2.882.639 18.013 April ------------------ -- - 2.899.673 17.034 May ............................ 2.905.595 5.922 Total ----------------------- ..---------- 131.871 The addition of 131.871 new employees in 8 months is the equivalent of adding 16.000 per month or 4.000 per week or 800 per day5day weekor 100 per hour8hour day. These 131.000 extra employees which the administration admitted they did not need are costing the taxpayers over $1 billion annually. Nor can all of these additions be attributed to the war in Vietnam. A large percentage are new employees hired under the everexpanding Great Society programs. For example. in the 5.922 additions for May we find the larger increases were in the Agriculture Department with 3.795. the Interior Department with 1.693. the Veterans Administration with 1.246. and the Post Office Department with 969. The Treasury Department reported a decrease of 5.407. In May in the Department of Defense the larger increases in civilian employment were reported in the Navy with 4.054 and the Army with 2.297. The Air Force reported a decrease of 4.625 for May. This total of 2.905.595 civilian employees certified to the Joint Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures by Federal agencies in their regular monthly personnel reports includes some foreign nationals employed in the U.S. Government activities abroad. but in addition to these there were 122.231 foreign nationals working for U.S. agencies overseas during May who were not counted in the usual personnel reports.",

Anticipating another such experience on the administrations tax policy I have written to the Secretary of the Treasury suggesting that if the administration is going to ask the Congress for a tax increase prior to its adjournment that it make its decision promptly and submit it to the Congress in order that we may have time not only to study the recommendations themselves. but also to have time to hold hearings and discuss proposed changes in some of the various recognized loopholes in our present tax structure. On the top of this list of inequities in our existing tax structure which need a broad revision before any tax increase is considered are the numerous depletion allowances for oils and minerals.

Included in the Education Professions Act is a provision for the training and maintenance of teacher aides. I have introduced along with Senators CLARK. MONDALE. and PELL. an amendment to the 1967 Elementary and Secondary Education Act to create a fulltime program to train and maintain teacher aides in the Nations elementary and secondary schools. Teacher aides can relieve the classroom teacher of many of the burdensome. timeconsuming. nonteaching duties they are now required to perform. At a time when the national teacher shortage has reached an alarming level. we must take immediate steps to keep the teachers we now have and make the job more attractive so that new teachers can be recruited. At the initiative of Representatives SCHEUER. of New York. and STEIGER. of Wisconsin. provision for teacher aides has been included in the Housepassed Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Hearings on this proposal will be held by the Senate Education Subcommittee after the Fourth of July recess. and I am hopeful that this program will be enacted this year. The proposal has the full support of the National Commission on Teacher Education and Professional Standards of the NEA.

The Commission. which represents a broad range of talent and expertise from all levels of government. has performed a public service by focusing new attention on the necessity for revenue sharing. It is unfortunate that the administration has not altered its position on the issue. Although both the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General are members of the Advisory Commission. they did not attend the meeting at which this action was taken. However. I understand that Secretary Fowlers representative has said that the Secretary feels it is \"premature\" to consider revenue sharing. This statement is somewhat surprising viewed in the light of statistics recently compiled by the Treasury Department itself which show that fiscal 1966 Federal grantsinaid payments to the States rose by 16 percent over fiscal 1965. Furthermore. Federal payments have increased since 1953 every year with only one exception. As total Federal grants reached $17.8 billion last year. is it premature to be concerned? I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1236. introduced by Senator HowARD BAKER. of Tennessee. which proposes a responsible first step in this direction that could be Initiated in the near future.

The Commission found that handling drunkenness within the system of criminal justice burdens and distorts its operation and appears ineffective in deterring drunkenness and in meeting the problem of the chronic alcoholic offender. As an alternate approach and as a prerequisite to taking drunkenness out of the criminal system. the Commission recommended the establishment of civil detoxification centers.

Many of us have tried through the International Red Cross and through other channels to reach these Americans on behalf of their families and in the name of humanity to give them that brief comfort that can come through contact with their loved ones. These efforts have been largely unsuccessful and there has been no significant recognition given by the North Vietnamese either to the International Red Cross or to the mandates of the Geneva Convention. Rather. we are now to be on the receiving end of a calculated and brazen propaganda effort designed to demonstrate that a nation which will not honor the Red Cross nor the families of these prisoners is the dispenser of humane treatment and has a concern for the welfare of the U.S. prisoners. There is only one way for North Vietnam to prove its good faith or its recognition of the basic guarantees for prisoners afforded by virtually every country in the world. That way is to permit these prisoners to send and receive letters and for their prisons to be opened for inspection by humanitarian groups of the representatives of neutral nations. Anything less should be branded for what it is: the brazen trafficking in propaganda for the purposes of concealing the true nature of the situation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Presidents 1969 budget has faithfuly carried through the cutback enacted by the Congress in December in spending for fiscal year 1968. This measure. recommended by the administration. itself. was aimed at the twin dangers posed by threats to the American dollar from abroad and incipient inflation here at home. Our December resolution called for. first. reductions in civilian agency obligations below the Presidents budget proposals by an amount equal to 2 percent of personnel compensation and benefits. and 10 percent of other controllable items. and. second. a 10percent reduction for the nonVietnam programs of the Department of Defense. The Budget Director testified that the combined impact of these reductions would be to cut spending for these programs by more than $4 billion. and obligations by more than $9 billion below the latest prior estimates presented to the Congress in August. There are some who might be tempted to scoff at these efforts and to ask \"what has happened to the cutback. in light of the fact that total 1968 expenditures are now estimated to be higher than ever before?\" The answer to these critics is very simple. There are certain expenditures of the Federal Government over which the executive branch has no control. Even the Congress cannot control them without basic changes in the underlying statutes. And much of this sort of spending is now estimated to be higher than forecast earlier. Examples are farm price supports. public assistance grants. and payments to the trust funds for medicare. These are the programs which have gone upnot the spending which is subject to the cutback. We should all be crystal clear on one point: had the cutback not occurred. spending would. in fact. be more than $4 billion higher in fiscal year 1968 than the budget we have just received indicates. The cutback was real. We must not allow the fact that other lockedin costs for other programs have risen override the fact that important cuts have been made with the support of the administration. Let us look at the Presidents 1969 budget in the same light.",

We did try very hard not to create a situation or permit a situation which would cause a riot. I am sure the Senator remembers very vividly that just 2 or 3 months ago before we adjourned last fallI do not remember the exact datea group of people came here from New York and assembled in the gallery of the House of Representatives. and created quite a commotion over there. They kicked our policemen. they struggled with them. they resisted arrest. and did all manner of things that would be normally classified as criminal acts. A great many charges could have been brought. This happened in the Capital City. the District of Columbia. Those persons were finally taken downtown before a judge. If I am not badly mistaken. and I do not think I am. a few of them were fined $10 each. Then. they were permitted to sign a bond for $10 and they were released on their signature. which was not a very reliable bond to start with. However. a $10 bond or a $10 fine. even if paid. is trifling enough to be almost an invitation to come back and do it again. In fact. I believe they said. \"We will be back next week.\" I agree with the Senator that we get terribly excited about something under the heading of civil rights. and yet right in the Nations Capital. right in the Congress. in the gallery of the House of Representatives. we let a bunch of hoodlums take over. and then. I would say. go virtually scotfree. I think the time has arrived in this country to stop talking about some of these things that are very inconsequential. which have been remedied. as the Senator has pointed out and enforce some of the laws we have. We have laws which. if enforced. would take care of much of this problem. I thank the Senator for yielding to me at this point.",

It is a terrible indictment of the Congress and the Government that they do not police the situation and insist on enforcement of the laws they have made so that schoolchildren can come here in a bus and walk with safety to the Library of Congress or to the Supreme Court. or any other institution that belongs to the Federal Government. We are going to have to do something about some of the things that exist so generally here and about the open demonstrations being carried out against the safety of the people.

I have very serious question about this business of undertaking to build 3.000 additional miles without at least the Ways and Means Committee being taken into the confidence of the Committee on Public Works to let us at least know the tax would have to be extended beyond 1975 or 1978. perhaps to 1981 or 1982 or 1983.",

An amendment is going to be offered by our distinguished colleague from Brooklyn . which will affect these authorizations and provide that none of them shall be used as an authorization for appropriations for what is known as the CrossBrooklyn Expressway. The Department of Transportation. I understand. has approved this expressway. No hearings have been held concerning that expressway for Brooklyn. The views of the citizens of Brooklyn affected by the expressway have not been heard. Those views should not be disregarded. Congressman ROONEY. CAREY. BRAsco. MURPHY. PODELL. and Mrs. KELLY. represent Brooklyn. We are all unalterably opposed to this CrossBrooklyn Expressway which has apparently been recommended by the Department of Transportation. The residents along this proposed route are greatly disturbed. agitated. and worried. They would not only be discommoded. but in most instances they would be dispossessed of homes that they have had for a lifetime. The area is replete with thousands of one- and twofamily houses. Those homes might be demolished or greatly damaged. Irreparable damage would be done and done needlessly. Originally the route. this interstate route. was to go across what is known as Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. And. that would be along an industrial route where there are comparatively few homes. Now. Mr. Chairman. it would be my thought. for this expressway to go the other route. along Atlantic Avenue. That avenue. which cuts through in this residential area. It is an industrial areaquite suitable for a CrossBrooklyn Expressway. It would thus greatly benefit the business and industrial community.

Tex.. commissioners court endorsing the International Boundary and Water Commissions plan to prevent a reoccurrence of the flooding in the valley of Texas as followed Hurricane Beulah this past fall. The city of Harlingen. located in Cameron County. was one of the urban areas that was hardest hit by the flood. That portion of the city along the Arroyo Colorado suffered very severe damage. Some 1.800 residences and other improvements were damaged. causing the evacuation of about 8.000 people which is equal to 20 percent of the citys population. A number of residences built below the high bank of the arroyo were flooded to the roof. Residences at the level of the bank were flooded to a depth of 3 to 4 feet. The crest of the flood in Harlingen was estimated to be 10 feet above the level reached in the 1958 flooding. Naturally. the city of Harlingen is very interested in any future flood control preparation. and the city commission has passed a resolution endorsing with certain modifications the IBWC plan. Two of the urban areas inundated by flooding in the valley. Harlingen and McAllen. are considered as in the lower valley. Thousands of acres of farmland in the lower valley were flooded. and some are still under water. Thus the Lower Rio Grande Water Committee is interested in increased drainage and flood prevention in the lower valley. and the committee in its meeting on January 26 passed a motion placing it on record as supporting the IBWC plan as it affects the lower valley. Therefore. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution of January 23. adopted by the City Commission of Harlingen. signed by Mayor George F. Young. attested by the city secretary.

While we have tens of thousands of troops in Active Reserve units it is a grave failure of the system to draft graduate students.

To prevent graduate school from becoming a means of avoiding the draft. however. all draft eligible men permitted to pursue graduate study should be required to enter a Reserve unit and undergo training to guarantee that upon completion of graduate study that they will equitably serve their country.

H.R. 14934. to reduce the ratio of regular postal employees to career substitutes from 5 to 1 to 4 to 1. was approved by our committee without objection and I offer my support in favor of its passage. The Postmaster General is. by law. presently bound to a fixed ratio of 5 regular employees of the postal field service to 1 carrier substitute in his employment practices. The result of this restriction. according to testimony presented at hearings before our Subcommittee on Postal Operations. is the necessity of hiring temporary substitutes to accomplish the daytoday work in our postal facilities. By changing the ratio. the Postmaster General will be able to appoint more employees as career substitutes and curtail to some extent the practice of hiring temporary substitutes. To explain further. a career substitute enjoys practically all of the advantages and fringe benefits of a career regular. except that the substitute is not guaranteed a regular workweek. His average workweek is 28 hours. The Post Office Department spokesmen strongly emphasized the desirability of career employees over temporaries by reason of their higher efficiency. broader postal knowledge. and interest in the service. Those appointed as temporary substitutes. according to the testimony our subcommittee received. generally are among the least qualified of those seeking postal employment. and are less efficient. The turnover rate of this group of employees is 89.9 percent. which obviously does not contribute to a stable operation of the postal service. It should be stressed that this legislation. in and by itself. will not create a larger work force in the postal service. The increased number of career substitute appointments will be offset by a corresponding decline in temporary appointments. the Post Office Department has assured us. If this legislation will result in an improved and more efficient postal operation. then I strongly favor giving the Postmaster General the administrative tools to accomplish this. Mr. Speaker.

These exceptions are outlined in the bill and take care of people whose business it is to help owners who have been locked out of their own cars. What this bill does really is to take away the ease of distribution of these keys. The easiest and most effective mass distribution system in the world Is the U.S. mail system. A teenager can clip an advertisement. use the mails and receive in return a set of keys giving him entrance to every car in the United States. This is bad enough. but the cost to him is less than $10. This bill will deny the wide distribution to first offenders. joyriders. and amateur thieves. The professional thief will make his own keys or steal them. but a youngster cannot easily do this. The shame of the whole master key business is that a few mailers for a few pennies profit can turn any joyriding youngster into a professional car thief. Car theft is a crime committed by young people. Eighty percent of Americas car thieves are under 25 years of age. 63 percent are under 18 years of age. For most of these young people it is their first crime. and for a good many. their first firm step on the way to a life of crime and prison. We are all concerned about juvenile delinquency. Here is a bill that will make juvenile crime more difficult. In short. keep master keys to automobiles out of the U.S. mails. for the same reason you would keep master keys to every home in America out of the U.S. mails. It is the mass distribution system provided by the Government itself that must be taken away from the disposal of unscrupulous mailers. I ask the House to support this bill.",

First. there is the advantage to the cotton growers in a particular area which would result from the enactment of this bill. I agree with the Senators statement that such a consideration should not be uppermost In our deliberation. When considered in this light. the bill would create a special case for the extralong staple cotton growers in the Southwest. Second. there is the effect which S. 1975 would have on our foreign policy and our economic policy because it would set a precedent. This. I believe. must be carefully considered. Opposition to the bill includes the argument that would tie the hands of the State Department. After listening to and reading the arguments of the Department of State over a period of years. in which it has urged that it be given permission to deal with the Imports and exports of commodities. and after considering the overall record. taken in toto. I believe the time has come when we should begin to think in the first instance of the welfare of our own particular growers. farmers. producers. and manufacturers here in America. It seems to me that over the last 25 years we have been asked repeatedly to take a position against our own people. We are always the one asked to make this gesture. It is always the American farmer or manufacturer who must or must not do something because of what may or may not be the result or ramifications in terms of the world struggle. Therefore. I would say that the time has come for us to act in such a way so that Mr. Nasser is faced with the decision. If he wants a peaceful Interchange of commerce. then he must act accordingly and stop playing the role of the middle man who can make demands of. and have his desires fulfilled by. both sides.",

I think this is a very salient question to be answered. Had we not imported so much cotton from Egypt and had we not imported so much cotton from the Sudan during this period of accumulation we would not have a surplus by the Commodity Credit Corporation. We would have had to increase our domestic production and no surplus would exist. but the surpluses are not credible to the domestic producers. Rather. the surpluses are due to the import policies of our State Department which did nothing to reduce the quotas in light of existing and accumulating surpluses which were taking place. I wish to analyze the price differential which I think is another integral part of this argument. Are we getting cheaper cotton for our mills as a result of the importation and quota system with which we bless Egypt today. I say we are not getting less expensive cotton. I have these figures from the Department of Agriculture which were compiled as of July 17. 1968. This is the comparison and analysis. American grade 3 staple cotton cost 43.45 cents per pound as landed in New England mills. Egyptian extralong staple cotton of the same quality cost 56.45 cents per pound. Egyptian extralong staple in a slightly better quality. cost 57.5 cents per pound. The Department of Agriculture has given me these figures which show that there is no benefit to the American consumer or American mills to buy Egyptian cotton. The reason they are buying this cotton now is that there is a shortage of supply on the American landscape and we have had to resort to importation. Thereby. as of today the mills are going to have to pay more than they pay for domestic cotton. So the price argument. I think. is very relative to this matter and very important in considering whether or not this bill should pass.",

I have found myself agreeing with the gentleman from Florida considerably in the last couple of days. but on this point I very definitely disagree with him. I will tell you why. I believe this is what the trouble is with a lot of these agencies downtown. because not even the President of the United States can call them up and say \"do this.\" or \"do that.\" There are too many safeguards built into the law so that too many people have no responsibilities to anyone. People who never were elected to anything. who never stood before the voters. are making the decisions. Further. I have a very personal reason for being against this amendment. The reason I have been less than enthusiastic about Appalachia. after being one of the people who did everything he could to get it passed in the first instance. was because its first Director was a fellow by the name of Sweeney who told me over the telephone that he did not do business with Congressmen. he was the Federal coadministrator. and he did business with the Governors. and Congress could stay out of it. In other words. we can be the big spenders by voting them money. but we cannot even call up and get the time of day from them. What does that have to do with this amendment? Well. this fellow became so obnoxious they got rid of him. Do you know where he wound up? He is Deputy Director of Transportation. So. Mr. Chairman.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in 1964 the Department of Agriculture began issuing its adjusted parity ratio index on an annual basis. Beginning this month they are issuing a monthly adjusted parity ratio index. They will continue the regular parity ratio index. of course. just as they have done in the past. I for one am glad to see the adjusted parity ratio issued on a monthly basis. It gives farmersand the publicone more yardstick with which to measure their wellbeing or lack of it. What the adjusted index does. in essence. it to add to the basic parity formula various direct Government payments that farmers receive. This year these payments will total roughly $3 billion and will equal some 7 percent of the farmers total market receipts. These payments are not included In the regular parity price formula. and to this extent the formula does not give a true picture of the farmers position compared to preceding years. before payments were used. when returns came almost exclusively from the marketplace. The reason the adjusted index was devised. back in 1964. is that a basic shift in farm commodity legislation had occurred. There has been a further shift in the past 3 years. with enactment of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1965. Under the new programs. American farm products are priced to compete in world markets. Direct payments are used to adjust production and bolster farm income. As one consequence. our total commercial exports for dollars exCXIII- 729Part 9 ceeded $5 billion last year. Feed grains became the No. 1 dollar earner among all American exports. including industrial products. The programs we operate under today are vastly different than the programs of the thirties. forties. and fifties. Be cause of the differences. the old. unrevised parity index did not give a complete picture of conditions. The two figures were released at 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon. The parity index on the old basis for April is 72. The preliminary adjusted parity index for the same period. which includes program payments. is 77. Both figures are valuable as benchmarks and for this reason. I believe the new monthly adjusted parity index will be useful.",

Certainly everyone knows that thankfully slavery has gone the way of the dinosaur and the dodobitd.\" \" Mr. President. my answer to thege people is simply this: slavery is very much alive in 1967. and increasing rather than decreasing. The AntiSlavery Society in London. founded in 1823. is a factgathering private organization which provided the impetus and persuasion for legislation abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire in 1833. Not content merely with the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire. the AntiSlavery Society has persisted to this day on a very limited budget and with a small staffin its effort to eradicate entirely from our civilization this barbaric practice of mans inhumanity to man. Between 1947 and 1962. the society has found. there has been a threefold increase in chattel slavery. The contemporary practice of slavery is concentrated. but not confined. in the Middle East. There. the increased purchasing power from oil profits has nurtured the expansion of slavery. a traditional practice in that region. However. there is a bright spot even in that area. King Faisal of Saudi Arabia has developed an effective program for stopping slave traffic within his nation. Still. forms of slavery prevail in such diverse areas as Africa--on both northern and southern borders of the Saharain the Andes of South America. in parts of Pakistan and India. and even in a section of the Philippine Islands. Slavery is decidedly a contemporary problem. We cannot ignore it. While slavery has been absolutely eradicated from our national life. the United States can exert a very positive international influence by ratifying the convention on slavery. We can use our considerable international prestige to bolster those nations which are conscientiously attempting to expunge slavery from their own lands and to demonstrate to other nations. not making the effort. that we are aware of their practice of slavery and are diametrically opposed to it. Therefore. Mr. President. I urge the Senate without further delay. to ratify the human rights conventions on forced labor. genocide. and political rights of women. as well as the convention on slavery.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as my colleagues know. I am the principal Senate sponsor of S. 612. the Dairy Import Act of 1967. I am happy to say that this legislation is now being sponsored by onehalf of the Senate. Furthermore. the Secretary of Agriculture has recognized the seriousness of the dairy import picture by calling for hearings under section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. However. action under this section to curtail imports can be considered. at best. only a temporary solution. As we have seen in the past. once quotas are set on Junex and Colby cheese. the principal offenders of our Import control regulations. new mixes and cheeses will be manufactured to circumvent these controls. This invasion by evasion can be halted only by a permanent control measure such as the Proxmire bill. which permits imports to share in any increase in domestic consumption yet places controls. based on a historical import figure. on dairy imports. In my estimation. the importance of S. 612 is highlighted by the fact that the proposed section 22 hearings have not dampened enthusiasm for import control legislation. In fact. since Secretary Freeman called for these hearings. three more Senators have placed their names on the Dairy Import Act of 1967. Finally. I am delighted to note that cheese importers have finally. although probably inadvertently. decided to call a spade a spade. As most of us know. dairy imports have cheated the dairy farmer out of his share in the national prosperity by taking advantage of loopholes in our Nations import control regulations. The Journal Of Commerce Import Bulletin for Friday. February 18. announced that eight cases of cheedham had been brought into the port of New York from Australia. If Congress acts this year to impose strict but sensible dairy import controls. foreign cheese manufacturers will not be able to \"cheat em\" any longer. with imports of cheedham or any other foreign dairy product.",

    "speech": "If there is an ominous threat to the wellbeing of the economy of the country. it has had very little discussion or attention on the front pages of the newspapers. I doubt very much whether the. American people are adequately alerted to what is involved. for if there is to be a strike against the rail carriers of the country. coupled. of course. with the difficulties that now confront us by virtue of a possible strike against the trucking industry. that really is an ominous threat. as I say. to the country. not only to its food supply. but to nearly every activity that takes place in the country. Probably the only thing to do. in the event the leaders of the union forces will not agree to an extension. is to have Congress extend the time under the Railway Labor Act. Sixty days are now allowed in which to achieve an agreement. If that period were extended for 20 days. the effect would probably be the same as under the 80day provision in the TaftHartley Act. At the present stage of negotiations. it would appear that something ought to be done as an emergent measure before the President departs on his trip to Latin America. I am advised that the House will take up this matter tomorrow under a suspension of the rules. But I am hopeful that the Senate probably can take the matter up today. Obviously. if the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare meets this afternoon. an objection might be made on the ground that whatever is reported will have to lie over for a day. In that event. we could adjourn the Senate. then reconvene the Senate. and still take action this afternoon. I sincerely hope that this course of action may be pursued. because we cannot trifle with the matter. There are those who think that perhaps the strike should be allowed to eventuate and that action be taken thereafter. But the readjustments. the damages. and the difficulties that ensue after a strike actually gets underway are absolutely incalculable. I trust. therefore. that we can find a way to extend the negotiating period for 20 days. By that time. the President will have returned from his Latin American visit. and there will be adequate time to pursue further the equities that are involved on each side of the bargaining table.",

Because this is the case. and because there are differences in periods of waiting and nostrike provisions. the public is confused. I think that many times the parties are confused and even Members of Congress are confused as to which of these two laws applies in this particular request by the President. It happens that the 20 days will extend the provisions under the Railway Labor Act to make it conform to the 80day waiting period that would apply if the TaftHartley Act were applicable. While it is unfortunate. in my opinion. that Congress does not have proposals and recommendations before it for revising the emergency strike provisions that we have under the several laws.

Pearson asserts that the Johnson administration is considering using the diplomatic break with Egypt as an excuse for the internationalization of world waterways. including the Suez Canal.\" If a faction of the Johnson administration is really advocating this action. then it is plain that Pearson is serving as a mouthpiece to drum up support. for he says: The United States. therefore. is in a justifiable position to move for the internationalization of Suez as a move toward stability and peace. What Pearson does not say explicitly is that the United States would be forced to internationalize the Panama Canal. if we first advocated the internationalization of Suez. Our stake in Panama is many times greater than our stake in Suez. At the present time. negotiations are proceeding for new treaties with Panama concerning the operation of the canal. I reserve my right to comment on those treaties at the proper time. but at the moment I would like to point out that internationalization of the Panama Canal is one of the most extreme proposals that radicals have made with regard to the canal. The reason is obvious. The United States is highly dependent upon the successful operation of the Canal. Any proposal that weakened U.S. control over the canal would increase the vulnerability of the United States. It is astonishing that Pearson could be ignorant of such a situation.

It is our canal. we built it. we fortified it. and we will protect it. and we will not permit our enemies to use It in war. In time of peace. all nations shall use it alike. but in time of war our interest at once becomes dominant. The same sentiments prevailed as late as 1956. when Secretary of State John Foster Dulles addressed himself to this very question of whether the status of the Suez Canal could affect the status of the Panama Canal. I quote from an article in the Washington Evening Star. The Secretary told a news conference in Washington yesterday the United States has all the rights in the Canal Zone which it would possess if it were the sovereignto the entire exclusion of the exercise by the Republic of Panama of any such sovereign rights. powers. or authority. The account added further: Mr. Dulles got into the Panama question with a statement declaring the situations pertaining to the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal are \"totally dissimilar in two vital respects.\" He said the Suez was internationalized by the Treaty of 1888. while the United States has rights of sovereignty over the Panama Canal.

The next day I sadly spoke again to voice my grief at his untimely death. Today. I join my colleagues in a last tribute to him. Assassination of public leaders in recent years has come too often for us not to be outraged at the forces that provoke them. I do not believe in mass guilt because of a heinous deed of any one man. but I do believe that we have come to a point where there must be a national dedication to destroy the forces that divide us--the hate. the fear. the bigotry. the violenceall the evils that tend to pit American against Americanthe evils that set the stage for the perpetration of lawlessness and criminal acts. ROBERT KENNEDY was a man who believed with unequivocal dedication that America must find a way to eliminate these divisive forces. that a way must be found toward racial justice. toward equal opportunity for each and every citizen. He believed firmly and sincerely that every American must have a chance to live his life in dignity and in freedom from fear and from want. ROBERT KENNEDY during his life pleaded for unity and compassion in this landfor justice and for progressfor an America in which our children. our grandchildren. and generations yet to come could live in peace. in hope. and at ease with one another. What greater tribute can we in this House pay to his memory than to dedicateourselves to the task of building the America he envisioned? He was but one mani who had great love for his country and .for the people in it. Many of usmost of usshare such a love. But ROBERT KENNEDY also had a vision. And when he spoke. so often. the words I quote below. he left to us a legacy that I hope will guide us in our dedication to the principles and purposes for which he lived: some men see things as they are and say why.

He was a beacon whose light shown toward a future of equality and opportunity which this country has yet to experience. His light was fueled by dreams for he was a man who dared to dream the dream that never was and ask: \"Why not.\" Now that light has been extinguished. But the dream remains in the hearts and determination of millions of Americans. It is an honorable dream and worthy of pursuit.

Certainly. where there is a void in this Nation as a result of his untimely and tragic death. there is an even greater void for the Kennedy family. Mrs. Rumsfeld and I offer our prayers for this family which has given so much through such tragic circumstances. It is to be hoped that. in the shadow of this tragedy. we might each seek the light of our personal responsibility to contribute. in our own way. to the quality of American life. to be constructive participants. not observers. and to work within the framework of a civilized society to achieve our best dreams for this Nation and its people. I salute the strength of spirit and the determination which characterized Senator ROBERT FRANcIs KENNEDY. If there is a lesson to be learned from the profound shock and grief. perhaps it is that every man is capable of these virtues if he will but give himself a chance to develop them. It would seem that this was a part of what Senator KENNEDY was attempting to instill in his fellow citizens. I would hope that we. his countrymen. will recognize our worth and our potential. as individuals and as a Nation. and continue to strengthen this society which has so much to contribute.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the amendment which proposes to withhold funds from SAGE would have a disabling effect on the air defense system of the United States. The importance of SAGE is that it provides the sole means that we have for intercepting an attack by bombers. SAGE also provides important radar surveillance which is an aid to the FAAs air traffic control. To be without these services would put an undue burden on the FAA as to the financing of these services. Mr. President. a more efficient and capable plan has been developed which has eliminated the more expensive and obsolete elements of SAGE. The improvement of SAGE can be manifested by the conversion of several stations to enable them to provide ample warning of ballistic missiles launched from submarines. This warning. then. will allow us to alert our bombers and aid in our effective deterrence. If the United States were to be deprived of SAGE. as is proposed by this amendment. then this plan would be rendered ineffective. In regard to the proposal to withhold funds from AWACS. it should be made known that this would curtail one of the most significant phases of our countrys air defense system. AWACS will become important as a method of dealing with Soviet low altitude bombers. The Soviets have developed a strong bomber force of long- and mediumrange of which some are capable of carrying standoff missiles. By implementing low altitude tactics. a force of this type could penetrate our defenses. Without AWACS the Soviet Union could strengthen these forces and. therefore. have the potential to threaten or damage our forces for defense. Mr. President. AWACS is a necessary system for discouraging a Soviet expansion of this nature.",

Senator BARTLETT could not be on the floor today. but we would be remiss indeed if in the discussion of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 we did not pay tribute to the extraordinary work the senior Senator from Alaska has put into this bill. Senator BARTLETT gave his first speech on a radiation health hazard on April 4. 1963. Since then he has made numerous statements alerting the Senate and the Nation to potential health hazards which could result from excessive levels of radiation. During the last session of Congress. he introduced S. 2067. which dealt with radiation safety and held hearings on the bill in August. This year he chaired 5 days of hearings on H.R. 10790. In each instance. the hearings have been praised for their thoroughness and fairness. While I think It is accurate to state that It was the report of emission of radiation from color television sets in excess of the generally accepted standard which gave added impetus to congressional action in the field of radiation safety. it should be noted that Senator BARTLETT has long been concerned about other potential sources of radiation. Testimony received at his hearings supported his concern. and he took steps to strengthen H.R. 10790 as approved by the House. Mr. President. with the exception of the amendment added by the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. the amendments being considered by the Senate today are the result of Senator BARTLETTS extensive knowledge in this area.

The foodstamp program is an outgrowth of a pilot program. tested and proved successful in every respect. in 43 divergent areas of this Nation. It has been judiciously expanded to more than 600 areas and further gradual expansion is contemplated under this authorization. The proposed\" change in this programthe requirement that localities pick up the tab for 20 percent of the bonus couponshas been termed a crippling amendment. It is more than that. It is. in fact. a death sentence. Its adoption most certainly would return hungry families to the dole of surplus commodity foods. Experience has shown us that the present program is the most efficient way to move more nutritious food to more deserving people of any method yet devised. It helps hungry adults and children. It has the overwhelming support of the food industryfrom the farmer to the grocery store. It has won the praise of our banking industry and welfare officials. It has improved health and the economy In every area where it operated. In spite of this efficiency and acceptance. the one local criticism that Is heard of the program is that it is presently too expensive. The very areas which need this program the most are those areas which can least afford the cost of the present program. Yet. these Impoverished areas. under enlightened local leadership. are making the sacrifice to finance the program and many more have requested assistance. Others are waitingattempting to find ways of financing it. Still others find the cost prohibitive under present circumstances. Mr. Chairman.

I am. however. opposed to the proposed provision which requires that States and localities finance 20 percent of the cost of the free stamps issued. This provision will not strengthen and broaden the program as its promoters contend. It will kill It. Those States and localities most in need of a stamp program would not be able to take advantage of It. Supporters say that matching funds are necessary to protect the States prerogatives in making major decisions in welfare programs. But. Governors and welfare officials in the States have not petitioned the Congress to require matching funds to insure State control. So. under the guise of States rights. we propose to act for the Stateseven though they have not asked for our help. The present provision for matching funds can only lessen the effectiveness of this program nationally by making it inoperative in many areas. It will keep it from Its goal of helping lowincome families and U.S. farmers. The 20percent provision should be defeated before it can defeat this most worthwhile program.",

Highest praise came from an expert in the field of aid to the poor and food distribution when State Welfare Commissioner Jim Phillips was quoted on February 19. 1966. in the Memphis Commercial Appeal as stating that the Federal food stamp program is the \"best of its type ever to be undertaken.\" He urged that it be extended to all 75 Arkansas counties in place of the surplus commodity program.",

On the evening of November 7. 1966. in the clubs John Wesley Powell Auditorium. its members and their guests were privileged to hear a remarkable address on \"Southern Africa and World Strategy\" by Col. Robert Gayre. of Edinburgh. Scotland. As a distinguished anthropologist. educator. author. and traveler who is now editor of the Mankind Quarterly. what he had to say on the value of the Cape of Good Hope sea lanes to Western civilization Is timely and absolutely true. The Communist world has a realistic understanding of this value and is making strenuous efforts to gain control of these strategic lanes. Unfortunately. in the Western World. bleeding hearts and the unconscious stooges of communism are blind to these realities and are joining forces with Communist power to bring about conditions in southern African countries which. if not stopped. will result in complete communistic domination of this key strategic region. Colonel Gayres address gives an illuminating. forthright. and objective treatment of southern Africa as regards the defense of Western nations. exposes the incomprehensible action of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in publishing a general staff type of war plan for the military conquest of South Africa. and clearly shows how the Suez CanalRed Sea route. Vietnam. and the Panama Canal are parts of the overall strategic plan for world domination. Because of the fundamental and realistic treatment of his subject. his presentation should be of great value to policymaking agencies of our Government. especially the Joint Chiefs of Staff. representatives of whom attended as invited guests.

Israel in less than two decades has made tremendous progress within its borders and has acted as a spokesman for democracy throughout the world. I wish to congratulate the people of Israel and its government on this occasion. Just as the people of Israel are constantly reminded of the hostility of their neighbors. so must we remember that the Middle East is indeed a danger spot. The most immediate danger. of course. comes from the border attacks by Syrian terrorists. United Nations Secretary General U Thant only a few days ago recognized this danger to the peace of the world and condemned the Syrian attacks. The United States should use its influence and prestige to bring an end to these outrageous threats to the peace. The Arab war against Israel takes forms other than outright violence. The attempt to boycott the State of Israel has involved American businessmen and those of other countries in that war. Recently the British Overseas Airline Corp. bowed to Arab pressure. It canceled two flights to the Far East through the Lod Airport in Israel because Pakistan threatened to withdraw overflight rights to planes en route to and from Israel. This action by BOAC is a violation of the freedom of the airways and affects all countries. In 1965 Congress passed an amendment to the Export Control Act specifically expressing our opposition to restrictive trade practices or boycotts by foreign countries against a country friendly to the United States. The passage of this amendment must not be merely a symbolic act. The Secretary of State should immediately notify the British Government of the U.S. strong belief that the BOAC flights be reinstated. The Arab boycott is one of the obstacles to peace in the Middle East. We must do everything we can to see that it is ineffective. If we are successful in the fight against the boycott. we will bring that much closer the day when Israel can celebrate its anniversary in peace.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am opposed to the Curtis substitute on two principal grounds. First. in a matter of the kind presented in the case of ADAM CLAYTON POWELL. the proceedings against him have a quasijudicial character. The select committee which considered the charges against Mr. POWELL did its work diligently. Despite its bipartisan makeup. it returned a unanimous report to this House. It is my judgment that under these circmnstances. the deliberations and conclusions of that committee should be sustained unless there are compelling reasons to set them aside. I found no such compelling reasons in this case. I do fear that the unwillingness of the House to accept the recommendations of this select committee flows from the widespread popular reaction against ADAM CLAYTON POWELL. This reinforces my conviction that the committees findings should be sustained lest the House yield to pressure on a matter peculiarly within the province of this House to determine. Second. the procedure incorporated in the Curtis substitute permits a Member to be deprived of his seat by a simple majority vote. notwithstanding the lack of any claim that Mr. POWELL has not met the constitutional qualifications. To deprive a Memberelect of his seat in this House is a very grave matter. As in the case of removal of other officials. it should require a twothirds vote. Thus. as a matter of precedent and commonsense. I believe it is wrong for the House to proceed on a course requiring only a onevote majority. In all of this. Mr. Speaker. I hold no brief for the conduct of ADAM CLAYTON POWELL. But I do believe it is essential that. though there is widespread concern. the House give even more attention to the importance of maintaining procedures which will safeguard the interests of everyone concerned.",

It is noteworthy that. in addition to looking at the socalled qualification factors. the majority House report further justified the exclusion of Berger under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment barring from the office of Representative anyone who has \"given aid or comfort to the enemies\" of the United States. 14 This category is predicated upon the novel facts involving the exclusion of B. F. Whittemore during the 41st Congress. 1870. 1 Hinds. Sec. 464. Rep. Whittemore resigned his seat while expulsion proceedings were pending against him for having sold appointments to the military academy. In a special election during the same session of Congress held to fill the vacancy he was reelected. but the House by resolution refused to seat him. In support of the resolution it was stated that since the House would have had the right to expel Rep. Whittemore for his crime committed during the session of Congress. that it certainly had the right to exclude him upon reelection after his resignation. other amendments will not be in order?

Monitoring of parolees is the springboard which propels Professor Fried into the realm of philosophy. There may be some valid reasons for the invasion of privacy. as Professor Fried mentions. but they should be weighed against the necessity of privacy to the conduct of normal and meaningful relations between individuals as well as the crucial relationship of man to the state. Professor Fried describes how important privacy is to our humanity and then goes on to say: Men would value privacy even if there were nothing in the world called love. friendship. or trust.

A heartening example of this trend is the recent student uprising and demonstrations in Poland which has resulted in the awakening of thousands of writers and individuals into militant protest against the political censorship of the Gomulka regime. And most important is the removal of Antonin Novotny as First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Hopefully the future will show that his dismissal marks the end to a leadership that up to now had resisted successfully all forces of liberalization influencing Eastern Europe since the death of Stalin. Alexander Dubcek. Novotnys successor as the party leader is believed to represent a more liberal form of communism that appears to be emerging within the whole of Eastern Europe. Statements made by Dubcek and the flavor of Western reporting from Czechoslovakia seem to suggest that the new regime is strongly committed to a liberalized form of communism. A key factor in this liberalization is the institution of meaningful economic reform that will hopefully regenerate the stagnated Czechoslovak economic system. making it more efficient and more productive. It is also suggested that the new regime will probably look increasingly to the West in matters of foreign trade. There is no evidence to suspect a break between Prague and Moscow. However. there seems to be no doubt that the new regime. unlike that of Novotnys. intends to pursue a more independent foreign and domestic policy.

I think the war on poverty is worth the effort and the expense we have committed to itand more. Let me cite an example. Since its inception. the Job Corps has trained more than 121.000 youngsters. On entering the Corps. 99 percent of these young men and women were unemployed. They had no jobs and no prospects. Their schools and their communities had just about written them off. The Job Corps. however. has managed to place more than 70 percent of these otherwise \"hopeless cases\" in wellpaying jobs. When a corpsman graduates after 15 months of training his average starting wage is $1.82 an hour. I think that is an extraordinary record of success. This and other programs of the poverty effort are accomplishing what they set out to accomplishthey are helping those who are poor become selfsufficient. Unfortunately. last session the Congress failed to appropriate the amount of money deemed to be necessary to carry on these programs. As a result 16 Job Corps centers have been closed. Other successes of the war on poverty. instead of being expanded. have had to be cut back. Mr. Speaker. It is utterly unwise to pinch pennies where the poverty program is concerned. When programs have been devised which work well at helping the poor out of poverty. the only sensible course is to expand those programs. That means appropriating enough money to do the job. Today the President asks us again to come forward and approve the amounts necessary to continue the war on poverty. I will support him. Hall of Fame Is Dream Come True:",

In spite of our national reputation as a country of homeowners a great deal still remains to be done. Americans can take a measure of pride in the fact that we have broadened the base of homeownership in the country over the years. We have consecutively liberalized the terms under which families may purchase homes with FHAinsured mortgages. Each time we took these steps. there have been those who charged that we were undermining the foundations of mortgage financethat the new risks were too great. History has proved the validity of a liberal approach to home financing. and conventional lenders have followed the lead of FHA in this regard. As President Johnson said in his state of the Union message: Surely a nation that can go to the moon can place a decent home within the reach of its families. For many lowincome families. the decent housing they seek includes the aspiration of ownership. Homeownership can help these Americans develop a sense of independence and dignity. In my opinion. this country has reached a level of progress from which we can begin to explore the ways and means by which we might extend the benefits of homeownership to families of modest and even low income. I ask my fellow Members to join with me in supporting the Presidents new homeownership program. Soviet Armed Forces Day. 1968",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. if we are going to be equal to the housing task President Johnson has outlined for us6 million homes in the next 10 years for low- and middleincome families--we must recognize our responsibility to fund all the programs involved. One of the most promising new tools we have for providing decent housing for lowincome families is the rent supplement program. The Presidents budget calls for $65 million in additional contract authority for rent supplement housing. This authorization will make it possible for private housing developers to build more than 72.500 new units for families with incomes at the public housing level. This is a reasonable extension of a program that has already proven its great potential. Some 42.000 housing units have been approved by the Federal Housing Administration under the existing authorization. Many are nearing construction. Others under way soon will be completed. Some are already in operation. In spite of its turbulent legislative genesis. once funds for rent supplement were authorized. the program moved ahead rapidly. The usual testing period for the program has passed and new housing is coming on the market in increasing volume. Rent supplements has a number of advantages: It works in the private sectorprivate sponsors develop. own. and operate the housing. Financing is by traditional private methods. Tenants have Incentive to move up economically because they are not forced to move if their income rises. Lowincome tenants pay 25 percent of Income as rent and a supplement is paid directly to the private owner by the FHA to meet the balance of the economic rent. As income increases the supplement decreases. The housing is on the local tax rolls and pays its share of municipal services. Lowincome families served by the program are not identified as \"project families\" and the apartment developments look like any other privatelyowned housing. The rent supplement program. an innovative approach to meeting lowincome housing needs. has gained considerable momentum. We should not take any action that might impede progress we can make with it. Instead. we should make clear to government and industry that Congress fully supports an active effort to produce more housing for lowincome families. When appropriation legislation supporting this request comes before us. I hope my fellow Members will join me in voting for the full $65 million President Johnson has requested. The Travel Tax",

I have talked to many people and done a great deal of reading in an effort to arrive at a fair judgment of the facts and have reached the conclusion that Lieutenant Commander Arnheiter. a career naval officer. has been wronged by the Navy. I am also disturbed over the fact that the Navy has not been as candid with me and with the press as it has an obligation to be. It has not always stuck to the facts in statements it has made regarding Lieutenant Commander Arnheiter. At first. it was very difficult to find outspoken individuals who would rally to Arnheiters support. However. because of the strange circumstances surrounding the loss of this command. and the almost bizarre parallels between this case and the fictional \"Caine Mutiny.\" many people have now begun to express their concern of the Navys commission of what may be a terrible injustice. We all realize it is not easy for an active officer of the line to speak up openly and criticize decisions of those on the highest levels of command. An officer will only do this when he is absolutely convinced that the cause he is speaking out for is a just one. That is why I am so deeply impressed with the letter I have received from Capt. R. G.

Practically the only reason I could think of for voting for this emasculated appropriation bill is that some vehicle is necessary to keep a concept of foreign aid alive. The bill represents a drastic and dangerous $1 billion cut from recommendations made by the administration and is an attempt by the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations to write policy matters which rightly should be dealt with by the Committee on Foreign Relations or the executive branch of Government. Today we are spending nearly $30 billion a year fighting the war in Vietnam. I can think of no greater insurance policy against this type of involvement than our foreign aid program by which we hope to help the emerging nations of the world. At a time when we should be doubling our commitment. we are making shortsighted cuts. The foreign aid program has changed in scope a great deal during the past few years. The major emphasis now is in lowinterest loans for such major projects as creating and conserving water resources. conservation. power development. internal communications. and food production. Together with the loan program we also have a technical assistance program supplying brain power which these countries need to adequately develop their resources. In our own hemisphere the commitment we made for the Alliance for Progress is being watered down drastically. It is my prediction that if this trend of emasculating our foreign aid obligations continues. the problems we have in Vietnam will be multiplied throughout the underdeveloped areas of this world. The schism of the future will not be between Communist and capitalist nations. but between the developed and underdeveloped countries and. to prevent this. there must be a strong commitment from all developed nations to give basic aid to these less fortunate countries. Only in this way can we reverse this disastrous trend of the rich nations becoming richer and the poor nations becoming even poorer. The Foreign Assistance Appropriation Act is deplorable. and in voting for this act I do so with the hope that sanity might be restored in the SenateHouse conference committee.",

I am glad to see that my distinguished friend. the Senator from New York . is in the Chamber. and. of course. the acting minority leader. because I understand this item has been cleared with everybody concerned. Of all the items in the supplemental bill. which was not adopted in the conference form yesterday. there was one item which was most urgent. a relatively small item of some $28 million for the Bureau of Employment Security under the Department of Labor for unemployment compensation for Federal employees and exservicemen. There were delinquent items in these two fields. as I now understand. going back to March. I think that is too conservative. My recollection is that some of them went back to February. We were all in accord in the conference. which took action heretofore on a much larger bill. that this item must be paid. that it is urgent. and that it should be honored in the least possible time. I am glad that the House of Representatives has done what it has. although I had no foreknowledge that it was going to do so. I now. by agreement reached between the leaders on the Committee on Appropriations on both sides of the aisle. and the leaders on both sides of the aisle. request that this item be promptly passed as now embraced in House Joint Resolution 1229. which was passed by the House this afternoon.

Indeed. this problem should have been solved weeks ago. for it was then that payment of unemployment compensation for Federal employees and for exservicementhose coming back from service in Southeast Asiawas suddenly and abruptly suspended. The Governor of my State of California recently conveyed his concern to me on this desperate situation. In California. we provide roughly 12.000 weekly payments in this area. This valuable compensation. for many weeks. has been denied to these worthy Americans. compensation which represents something in excess of onehalf million dollars each 7 days. The tragedy. of course. has been that this undeniably needy item. free from any kind of bitterness or controversy. has been tied up in the difficulties which have swirled around the general appropriation bill. I join my able friend from Florida and my able friend from New York. in congratulating the other body for sending this resolution to the Senate and hopefully. its benefits to thousands of needy citizens.

I am pleased to cosponsor Senator HARTS proposal to substitute the language of H.R. 15398 for the bill reported by the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry on the National school lunch program. An important purpose of this amendment is to extend the coverage of the National School Lunch Act to cover daycare institutions which provide care for children in poor areas or areas with a high concentration of working mothers. At the present time there is no program designed to combat malnutrition in our very young children. In addition. the National School Lunch Act does not operate in the summer months when the schools are closed. Educators have told us that children do far better in their schoolwork and learn faster when they are not hungry. Medical science has shown that continued malnutrition retards mental as well as physical development. When the Congress passed the 1967 Social Security Act Amendments. we provided a new training program for unemployed mothers on the welfare rolls. This will result in a great need for additional child daycare centers. As these centers become filled with children. it is essential that the nutritional needs of the children be met. The program is vital to these preschool children to prevent early physical and mental damage which often is irrevocable. Headstart officials have stated that in some areas of the country they have discovered anemia rates of over 50 percent in Headstart enrollees. This clearly indicates the great need for an expanded child nutrition program. This is a modest proposal. but one which is necessary for the health and wellbeing of many of our Nations children.

I wish to renew my expression of concern with reference to this citythe Nations Capitaland to express again the hope that most careful consideration will be given to retaining a military presence in the city during the summer. I do not maintain that the presence of 14.000 or 15.000 troops is necessary. but I do think it is imperative that there be some degree of military presence through the summer. or at least as long as we can expect a campaign of demonstrations such as has been announced repeatedly during the past several weeks. Particularly do I think. Mr. President. that it would be well for a military presence to be retained in the area of the Capitol Building. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I am concerned lest the ounce of prevention may come too late. The thought that the Nations Capital should require the presence of Federal troops for its protection. and the protection of its citizenry. is not a pleasant one. It is hard to believe that. in a country such as our own. it would ever be necessary. but in view of the increasing difficulty of maintaining law and order. and in view of the potential for a repetition of recent happenings. I believe that it would be a reasonable precaution. Other Senators have voiced the same opinion to me privately. and within the last few days. I have had several personal contacts from District of Columbia citizens who have expressed concern lest the city be left without adequate protection. I realize that rumors are rife. but one is not always able to distinguish between rumor and fact until it is too late. If nothing more. I hope that the recent authorization to move troops into the city may be kept in effect so as to eliminate timeconsuming processing of any troop request which may have to be made. if an emergency should again develop. I trust that the Mayor and other appropriate authorities will consider this matter and I hope that the Chief Executive also will give the subject due and proper consideration.",

In the last 7 years. the population of Metropolitan Las Vegas has increased 123 percent--more than four times the national growth rate. This staggering influx of people has placed a heavy burden on those responsible for insuring orderly planning in southern Nevada. The need to provide new and improved public services is a critical challenge that must be met daily. Fortunately. local government in southern Nevada has been equal to the task. But the future will bring even greater challenges. since Clark Countys growth is expected to continue at the same dramatic pace for many years to come. With this in mind. the Board of Clark County Commissioners recently approved the first executive development program for county employees in the area. It Is aimed at upgrading the competence of public employees at the staff. .supervisory. and executive levels. and encouraging these employees to continue the pursuit of education that will help them in their jobs. The program. consisting of six seminars in public administration. .has the active support of Mr. David Henry. administrator of Clark County. Instruction is under the supervision of Dr. A. B. Villanueva. associate professor of public administration and urban affairs at Nevada Southern University in Las Vegas. Mr. Henry and Dr. Villanueva were responsible for developing the program. This endeavor is perhaps unique in that it has been undertaken by the county without any outside financial assistance. Implementation was entirely the result of local effort spearheaded by two imaginative and creative men. Recently. Dr. Villanueva and Mr. Henry outlined the principal objectives and characteristics of the program In an article published in the American County Government. Because the Clark County undertaking might well serve as a model for other local governments. I believe the observations of the authors would be of widespread interest. Accordingly.

In his remarks the President cited the Social Security Act as a \"social miracle that has been happening in our country has allowed tens of millions of older people not to give up things. and not to be afraid of their future.\" Turning his attention to the medicare program. the President commented: It is hard to believe that only 2 years ago. millions of elderly Americans lived in fear of a sudden medical emergency that could wipe out their savings after a lifetime of hard work. That was what we called \"social insecurity.\" The enactment of the medicare bill that ... passed in 1965 eliminated that fear for more than 19 million proud. elderly Americans. nearly 10 percent of the total population of America. Mr. President. the proclamation for Senior Citizens Month. 1968. begins with a truly meaningful paragraph. It expresses a thought that should be central to all efforts aimed at improving the lot of the elderly. I quote: The respect we show for older Americans is not an act of charity.

Present law prohibits the deduction of all amounts paid for advertising in such a program. although they may constitute an ordinary and necessary business expense which otherwise would be deductible. The amendment now pending is limited so as to maintain the prohibition against deduction of political contributions that are made in the guise of advertising expenditures in convention programs. To accomplish this. the amendment is applicable only if the amounts paid are reasonable in the light of the business the taxpayer may expect to receive as a result of the advertisement. or are reasonable in the light of the business expected to be brought by the convention to the area in which the taxpayer has a principal place of business. In addition. the amendment applies only if the proceeds of the program are used solely to defray the costs of conducting the convention. Mr. President. as I stated earlier.

I know that at the proper time he will give ample time to this matter. because. in my judgment. it is of the highest importance. I am particularly concerned with that part of the bill having to do with defense installments and the operation of various contractors and their employees who operate under Government contracts. This concern of mine for safeguarding the national security was heightened by the Supreme Court decision of this week dealing with an admitted Communist who was employed in a defense installation. Legislation along the lines of this bill was originally recommended by the Commission on Government Security. which Commission was established by Congress to fill an urgent need for an objective. nonpolitical. and independent study of the innumerable laws. Executive orders. regulations. programs. practices. procedures intended for the protection of the national security. In their summary of recommendations. the Commission indicated that: The Commissions recommendations. if put into effect. would enhance the protection afforded national security while substantially increasing the protection of the individuals. In view of this weeks decision by the Supreme Court in the case involving an admitted member of the Communist Party. I think it urgent that Congress adopt new legislation to take the place of that which the Court struck down. This modified version of the Commissions recommended legislation has been altered in an attempt to fit it within the framework of the case decided by the Court this week and at the same time provide the country with the complete protection that we need. Considering the situation in this country at this particular time in our history. I feel that there is great urgency for comprehensive legislation of this type and I would hope that my colleagues share this urgency and act promptly to secure its enactment.",

Is this the way to win hearts and minds? Administration leaders boast that twothirds of the Vietnamese population are now in \"secure\" areas.

Mr. President. one of the best examples of how Americans can win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese has been the splendid operations of the International Voluntary Services. While this fine organization continues to perform invaluable services in Vietnam. particularly in the field of agriculture. education. and health. three of its top leaders felt compelled several months ago to resign because they believed that our military action was proving counterproductive. and threatened to alienate the majority of the Vietnamese from their American saviours.

Nevertheless. the rich results of Mrs. Millers tireless endeavors could not remain in anonymity. and her election as vice president of the Jewish Community Federationthe first election of a woman to that office in 38 yearsis a fitting and well deserved tribute to her many remarkable accomplishments. Cleveland is proud of Mrs. Anne Miller and I am glad to include an article which appeared in the December 28. 1967. issue of the Plain Dealer:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. however unfair it may be to forget the great progress this country has made in assuring equal treatment to all its citizens. we cannot overlook that there remain many areas in which racial discrimination is the rule. President Johnson eloquently pointed to these areas in his civil rights message last week. We cannot stand still in civil rights. As Members of Congress. we will not have the right to rest until every American can be certain of obtaining a home. a job. a meal. a trial. without being subject to discrimination on the basis of race. The legislation that President Johnson proposes to help achieve these ends is wise and Just. I support it with deep conviction. This civil rights package of measures was submitted to the 90th Congress last year. It did not receive our approval. But we cannot be hesitant this year. I recognize that the bottleneck to a civil rights bill is now in the other body. but I urge the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on this bill. to expose to the public how much these laws are needed. In the past 4 years. the President and the Congress compiled one of the finest equal opportunity records ever put together by any administration. More has been done to advance educational opportunity. voting rights. and the right to a job. than ever before. We were the men who helped President Johnson strike down the last remaining color and race barriers to full opportunity. We must act courageously again on the bills now before us. President Johnsons message asks us to do what we know is our duty. Mr. Speaker. it is my most profound hope that we pass an important civil rights measure in the current session of Congress.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we were all shocked and saddened by the tragic earthquakes which occurred in Sicily last month. Thousands of Sicilians lost their lives. homes and livelihoods as a result of this great natural disaster. While emergency shelter was provided for most of these people. many of the temporary quarters were destroyed by subsequent tremors and floods. Unfortunately. the future is bleak in this underdeveloped area. \ufffd Various European nations have opened their doors to the earthquake victims. However. although many of these homeless people are close relatives of American citizens and have waited for a considerable time to obtain visas to join their families in this country. our immigration laws do not take their current plight into account and they are counted against the ceiling of total Italian immigration. Therefore. as there is no specific provision for the issuance of any special visas to them. I have today introduced legislation authorizing 2.000 special immigrant visas for the immediate entry into the United States of Italian earthquake victims. This legislation is certainly consistent with our traditional policy of aiding those made homeless by catastrophe or oppression and similar legislation was enacted in 1958 to assist Portuguese victims of the volcanic eruptions in the Azores. My bill applies to only those earthquake victims whose homes and means of support have been destroyed and they must still fulfill the present eligibility requirements for the issuance of immigrant visas such as health. good character. and so on. Mr. Speaker. we must act with great urgency to help alleviate the suffering and distress of these unfortunate people and I urge the prompt enactment of this legislation.",

My bill would make available 2.000 special immigrant visas. and the wives and children of these persons would also be issued special visas. This special legislation is necessary to provide entrance into the United States to these unfortunate families so that they will not be charged against the Italian immigration quota. This proposal is not without precedent. When volcanic eruptions in the Azores occurred in 1958. similar special legislation was enacted to help the Portugese victims of that disaster. It is in our American tradition to open our doors to the hopeless and to the distressed. We have an obligationmore. we have a dutyto offer a haven to these people. to give them an opportunity to begin a new life. From all reports. the earthquakes were of such magnitude that even the land is gone and there is no possibility of rebuilding on it in the near future. These Sicilian families face a hopeless future. Many of these people have relatives in the United States and have long wanted to come here to live. They have encountered numerous delays in obtaining visas. My bill can accomplish a twofold purposeit can alleviate the suffering that the earthquake victims have had to endure. it can also result in permitting many families who have been separated for years to come together.

Our country has always looked after her veterans through programs established for their benefit and this practice will continue. The high regard with which President Johnson holds our veterans and servicemen is expressed by his second special appearance before Congress on behalf of veterans affairs. His requests and actions encompass the entire veteran population. He spoke of medical care. educational benefits. increased servicemans group life Insurance coverage. and new methods to inform veterans of the benefits available. I support these requests and emphasize the sweeping program for jobs and training. especially the new VIPS program which encourages veterans to train and work in the public service. I share the Presidents desire to assure every veteran the right to burial in a national cemetery situated reasonably close to his home. In California we have experienced the primary problems of limited space and the rising cost of land. but I submit that this can and must be corrected. To this end I believe that the Administrator of Veterans Affairs should be given the responsibility of resolving the dilemma. His agency is charged with the welfare of veterans and I believe that it Is well prepared to solve the current crisis existing in the national cemetery system. It seems logical to me to transfer this responsibility to the VA and I would support legislation to accomplish this. I reflect the words of President Johnson in saying that I am ready to act on \"the responsibilities unique to our own day. Today. as in times past. it is on Americas fighting men that this Nation must depend. Their service honors us all.\" I join the President in looking forward \"to that good day when they will return as free. upstanding and selfreliant citizens.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last Thursday. the 25th of January. in a public statement I urged the United States to respond cautiously and firmly to the capture of the intelligence ship. U.S.S. Pueblo. by North Korean gunboats. Then. as now. I think the important thing is not to panic. We are a large and powerful Nation. and we have the responsibility not to act precipitously because of the obvious consequences. The continuation of the war in Vietnam. together with the great costs of the Korean confrontation of the early 1950s. should serve to encourage us to act with restraint. The use of all our planes and guns and men will not bring out our 83 men alive. As soon as we applied military force. our 83 men would be killed. and our ship destroyed. Thus there is every reason to continue to pursue our present strong diplomatic efforts. I am gratified that the President has taken this matter to the United Nations. and I am pleased that the U.N. has dealt with this matter seriously and in a way that promises to be helpful. At the United Nations and elsewhere our diplomatic efforts are continuing. The Presidents decision to call up 14.000 reservists appears to be having a sobering effect on the North Koreans. I have every reason to be hopeful that we will find a peaceful solution to this crisis. However. if the United States is to serve effectively as a deterrent to future wars. we must show that we will react with resolve. The Soviet Union must certainly recognize that her ships and naval operations are just as subject to piracy as ours if the law of the sea and international law is not respected. Russia too must act responsibly. Negotiations over this incident will at best be difficult. But we are a great power. We are not easily threatened by a small power like North Korea. I fully expect our Nation will act in this matter with initiative and resolve. and at the same time with restraint and caution. Through diplomatic channels we can negotiate the return of our ship and her crew. There have been similar incidents in recent history involving return of American personnel. Eventually negotiations will be successful. With patience and persistence I feel confident our men and the ship will be returned.",

The bill also provides that the spouse and children of such aliens. if accompanying or following to join. may be issued special immigrant visas notwithstanding such numerical limitation. The dire need of these people. made homeless and poorer than most poor. deserves our generous consideration of such legislation at the earliest possible moment.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in his economic report. the President has cogently stated the basic challenges facing our Nation. and has proposed wise. effective measures to meet them. Especially meritorious are the Presidents recommendations for solutions to the problems which afflict our great cities. As the President correctly stated. one particularly important order of economic business is to scale the size of existing effective programs to the magnitude of the urban problems which they attack. The model cities program is a powerful weapon against urban decay in our Nations most blighted neighborhoodsbut only if the necessary funds are provided. . The dramatic new approaches to federally subsidized housing developed in the past 2 yearssuch as rent supplements. \"turnkey\" public housing. and belowmarket interest ratessuccessfully draw the private sector into the attack on slum housing. But if these programs are to succeed in providing what President Johnson believes the Nation should provideevery American with a decent home within a reasonable period of timethere must be addditional funds. The Presidents proposal to multiply by several times the current rate of federally assisted housing construction. recognizes the top priority which Congress and the Nation must give to eliminating dwelling units which are unfit for human occupancy. We must mobilize the Nations resources to rebuild and reshape the cities. President Johnson has made many noteworthy recommendations along these lines. First. ghetto residents ought to have the chance to be trained and employed on the project made possible by Federal housing and urban development programs. Second. our vast national reservoir of technological talent should be tapped and directed toward solving many critical technical problems of the cities: How can we build decent. well constructed housing more cheaply. how can we solve the transportation problems within cities. what can we do about pollution and other forms of environmental deterioration? We look with hope and confidence to the Presidents proposed Institute for Urban Development to provide some answer to these and many other important urbanrelated questions. As the President stated in his Economic Report: \"The agonies of our cities will not yield easily or quickly.\" Yet the programs the President has outlined will make important. visible inroads against urban decay. I commend the President for the positive. effective contribution he has made and is making in turning the American city into a showcaserather than a paradox--or our national prosperity.",

But I merely wish to state my conviction that the path to a better life for all Americans lies not through anger. violence. and the threat of separatism. The first tenet of democracy rests upon a willingness of all citizens to observe and respect the law. Progress of civilized mankind is best assured through the maintenance of order. The whole thrust of cooperative effort among and within nations has been based upon the recognition that violence and war are improper means for the achieving of civilized ends. We must always insist upon observance and respect for the law. This is our first and foremost duty and responsibility. Further. I am convinced that real progress can only be achieved by men of good will who are able honestly to tell of their peoples grievances and oppressions and who will then work responsibly for their relief. I am also convinced that the U.S. Senate must have the courage to lead out in this effort. Criticism is not enough. The Senate cannot satisfy itself with merely decrying the misguided efforts of black power advocates if we do not provide a forum where the responsible political leaders of our Nations minorities might be welcomed and heard. Good faith requires a recognition of the common problem in the Congress as much as in the street.

In addition. it is clear from the discussion we had this morning that rifle preparation can be obtained just as well from individual hunting. target firing and other shooting activities as it can from DCM Club membership.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I feel that the Senator from West Virginia has rendered a conspicuous service to his fellow Americans by his strong plea in the Senate today for law and order. The Senators speech is well reasoned. provocative. and restrained. yet he puts his finger on many basic facts that need to be brought before the American people. With the rioting that is taking place all over the United States. it is vitally important that men in public life speak out frankly and strongly for law and order. That is what the Senator from West Virginia has been doing today. It seems to me that what is necessary is that those in administrative positions and in high public office. charged with enforcement of our laws. enforce them without fear and without favoritism. The speech of the Senator from West Virginia today is not the first that he has made on this subject. The current issue of U.S. News & World Report publishes excerpts from another speech made by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. on July 17. In that speech. he ended with these words: We cannot stand idly by and tolerate the shameful rape of democracy in our Republic. Those who choose to step outside the law must be punished. And those who insist upon force must be met with a greater force. Mobs must not be permitted to prevail. That speech of the Senator from West Virginia was made prior to the rioting which recently occurred in New Jersey and prior to the rioting which has been taking place over the past weekend and is perhaps even now continuing in the city of Detroit. Although the speech of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on July 17 was made on the floor of the Senate. I think it is so provocative and so well reasoned that I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled \"Poverty. Phony Excuse for Riots? Yes. Says a Key Senator.\" published in the U.S. News & World Report of July 31. 1967. be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

They will be more than satisfactory in many of the States of the Nation. particularly in the Great Plains States where you have a free flow of air. but in California we found out they are inadequate. because the devices are around 40 or 50 percent effective in certain areas and because of a 600.000 accretion of new automobiles registered in California this year and the pollution that they emit from their tailpipes. the overall quantity of pollution does not go down. Therefore. we seek more efficient devices. What we want to do is go forward and have these devices perfected.

During the time that I was mayor of the city of Omaha we enacted the first effective legislation to clean our air of pollutants. As mayor I assembled a very capable staff to carry out the legislation which I sponsored and there was a tremendous difference in the cleanliness of our air in Omaha as a result of this very effective program. Our program. however. at that time was aimed primarily at belching smokestacks and other industrial emissions. I might add that there is absolutely no excuse for a smokestack to belch smoke. If it does. it means that the incinerator and/or the burning unit. whether it be in a plant or in a home. is not operated correctly or efficiently. By operating a heating unit and/or an incinerator in an industrial plant efficiently. the smokestacks will not produce black. sooty smoke. However. this act is much broader. as it should be. and takes into consideration many other problems that confront us today. and I am hopeful that the day will sometime come when we can walk our streets without breathing toxic and polluted air. Automobile exhausts are a major pollutant. and with the fine cooperation of the automobile industry and the operators of vehicles larger than the ordinary passenger car. I am hopeful that we can sometime soon feel free to breathe good. fresh air. which we all know is so valuable to our health and the length of our lives. I would also be hopeful that truck and bus owners and operators might recognize the problem and give their serious attention and assistance to its solution. It would seem to me that they would want to do this. not only as a public relations gesture. but because they. too. are interested in the health of our people.

President of the National Automobile Association that has been alluded to previously a few times. indicating that he is aware of his problem. and this relates to the question of double standards. and how they recognize it as being necessary. He said: V. The one possible exception to national standards I referred to earlier has its roots in scientific considerations. The smog problem in southern California is unique in its intensity and in the number of days it is present. Unlike other areas. it has a hot sun most of the year and a topography which impedes the free flow of air currents with a consequent propensity for air to remain motionless. Because of these unique conditions. paragraph (b) of section 208 of S. 780 in effect authorizes. after notice and opportunity for hearing and subject to certain safeguards. standards more stringent than national standards. While the automobile industry would. for the reasons already stated. prefer a single national standard. it recognizes that the Los Angeles smog problem is unique. Indeed. one of the problems we all face in the future is to keep the cost of the automobile within reach of the great majority of those who need them. Under these circumstances. and given these possible future contingencies. the automobile manufacturers while preterring uniform national standards. do not oppose the objectives of paragraph (b) of section 208. With difficulty automobile manufacturers could \"live\" with two different sets of standards. I repeat. he makes the point that with difficulty automobile manufacturers could live with two different sets of standards. But what we are asking.

We must continue and expand our research efforts to establish effective remedies. President Johnson had this problem well in mind when he said: Many sources of air pollution cannot be economically or effectively controlled by our present technology. The sheer number of motor vehicles may. within a decade or two. defy the best pollution control methods we can develop. If this proves true. surely we cannot continue to use the type of internal combustion engine now in service. New types of internal combustion enginesor Indeed new propulsion systemsmay be required.

The bill. as reported by our committee. places the responsibility for prescribing standards for California in the hands of the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare. In my judgment. this is a sound procedure. While it will facilitate unified direction and enforcement of the Federal control program. it will. nevertheless. permit those participating in the program to deal with a single agency. HEW will be charged with establishing a national program in the area of automobile exhaust emissions. At the same time. it can permit a specific variation from the national controls as required by California. Most importantly. the I single administrative responsibility in HEW would tend to reduce the possibility of conflict in administrative inter- pretation between varying and possibly I competing regulatory agencies I can understand the concern of Caliornia with increasing air pollution problems. and I can understand the need for California to give itself the maximum amount of flexibility possible. No one disagrees with Californias need to work toward increasingly stringent standards. We hope it will. But the ultimate coordination and thrust of a national program belongs at the national level. Research. testing. evaluation. and setting of standards is complex enough without legislating parallel or duplicative efforts. If experience is any guide. two administrators of this program would dilute the national objective. diffuse testing and evaluation of new control systems. and eventually result in an increase in costs of the devices themselvescosts borne by every consumer in every State. All these complications are made worse by the problem of patchwork laws affecting American motorists driving interstate. Since HEW is an agency of the U.S. Government and has the authority under a 1965 act of Congress to set these standards. I urge the House to enact S. 780 as reported by the House Commerce Committee. Why should the California Legislature carry out the role which Congress itself assumed when it passed the Clean Air Act in 1963 and the 1965 amendments thereto governing auto pollution.

We think that it is CXIII- 124--Part 2 important to emphasize the point that air pollution is a problem that could trouble any city having 50.000 or more people. Denver is a good example of such a city. It feels a sense of urgency about the problem. St. Louis has an interstate situation. It is not the only city having that problem. but we think that out of the St. Louis situation we can learn lessons that might be applicable elsewhere. Detroit is the place where the automobile is manufactured. We need to probe the experience of the industry in California and the lesson learned there. which is being applied to motor vehicles in the 1968 models. all of which will have this device. We could hold hearings throughout the country2 years ago we held hearings in eight citiesbut time does not permit the scheduling of more hearings this year.",

Second. we are interested In field hearings and will hold field hearings not only in connection with air pollution but also in connection with intergovernmental relations. the other subject which the Senator mentioned. The two sets of hearings now scheduled promise t) occupy so much time that we may not be able to get into other areas. but we will certainly try. Let me make this additional comment. which has been sparked by the Senators observations. When the federal system was established. the Founding Fathers did not really envision. I do not believe. anything like the metropolitan areas of today. So that. really. the Federal structure. in its present form. provides no means for effectively governing metropolitan areas. I believe that the air pollution problem is perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of our inability to govern metropolitan areas. This. I think. is one of the reasons why I am struck by the Presidents recommendations In this field for the consideration of air pollution in terms of air sheds and for the establishment of regional commissions identified with air sheds so that we can effectively deal with the total air pollution problem under an institution which does not now exist in the federal system. The creation of such a commission will not eliminate the responsibility of local communities. It will notand should noteliminate the responsibility of the States. But. in order to tie them together. we do need to create another air pollution institution.",

I invite his attention to the rather unique interstate compact which was created not too many years ago by the States of New Jersey. Pennsylvania. Delaware. and New York. to deal with the allpurpose control of the waters of the Delaware Riverknown as the Delaware River Basin Compact. That unique compact created a board of five membersa representative from each of the four States and a representative from the Federal Government. The Federal Government has only one vote. This was rather difficult to put across. but the fact is that the Federal Government became convinced. since it held the purse strings. that it would be able to say yea or nay with respect to any recommendation by a majority of the commission which would call for the expenditure of Federal funds. That was all the protection needed. It might well be that a similar agency would be applicable In the area of air pollution control. which has many aspects in common with water pollution control. Finally. I point out to my friendperhaps to push my argument a little furtherthat we are not going to hold hearings in any State along the Atlantic seaboard where the problem. really. Is critical. Of course. I speak for Pennsylvania. I notice with some pleasure that there are no Senators frorm Connecticut. New Jersey. or New York on the floor at the moment. or else they would be.

I would particularly like those Members who have been most vocal on the question of Vietnam to consider this extraordinary description of our position by Secretary Rusk. I have been concerned recently that some of the debate about Vietnam might be misunderstood in Hanoi. The aggressor may very well feel that this discussion within the American political context might somehow signify a lack of will on the part of the American people. I trust that the other side. too. will reflect on what the Secretary said. and that Hanoi will realize that our national interest and our peoples views are such that we will not shirk this difficult burden. We do an injustice to our country and to our brave fighting men if we are to continue to reduce our noble purpose and our disagreement over means to any implication that we lack the will to persist. At times the debate in this country has suggested that we lack this will. I think it is time to elevate the dialog over our policy in Vietnam and to unite without regard to partisan politics. My hope is that those who would deny what is best in our country and who make their alienation from current goals into personal vituperative criticism will consider the words of Secretary Rusk.

This courageous soldier and freedom fighter devoted his short life to the battle against political tyranny. At a young age he joined his countrymen in an effort to drive the Russians from Polish soil and to liberate Poland from foreign domination. They fought valiantly for several years only to lose. and Pulaski was forced to flee to Turkey. In 1775. Pulaski was in Paris and there he learned of the colonists fight for their independence. He seized the opportunity to again join in a struggle for liberation and volunteered his services without charge to help the colonists. He fought with distinction on their side until he was wounded in battle at Savannah on Few men have fought more fiercely for freedom and did more to advance the cause of liberty and justice than General Pulaski. He. along with his fellow countryman. Kosciuszko. were among the best and ablest of the generals who served the young republic. We are indebted to them and to countless others who followed their illustrious example in successive struggles for freedom. The first known Poles arrived on Americas shores in 1608. Today there are millions of Americans of Polish descent. Loyal citizens. courageous and fearless fighters. they have served in every war in which our country has been involved. Hardworking. industrious. and gifted. they have made manifold and continuing contributions in the defense and progress of our great Nation in industry. in professions. and in the arts. Since 1939. Poland has suffered deeply under both Nazi and Communist tyranny. Despite ruthless oppression. the Poles have not lost faith in the freedom to which Casimir Pulaski dedicated his life. We hope and pray that they will again enjoy the blessings of freedom and liberty in their homeland.

Like most of my colleagues I found myself in a dilemma regarding this bill and shared their reservations about it. I. like them. would liked to have had a better bill. especially as it relates to the needs for salary of the postal employees. to vote for. There was no choice but to vote to recommit this bill and I did so. The proposal for salary increases for postal workers in the bill is not consistent with the need to reclassify and upgrade certain postal employees. The salary adjustments represent only another stopgap measure. In addition this bill delegates to the next President extraordinary powers over pay. expenses. and allowances of Members of Congress. Federal judges. heads and assistant heads of executive agencies. as well as other Government officials. This should not be a part of this bill. The establishment of the Quadrennial Commission is merely duplication. and such Presidential power over pay. expenses. and allowances of top Government officials can lead to abuse and intimidation in the future. To me it is wrong to have salary increases and a raise in postal rates in the same bill. The two subjects are not related. There was sound reason to separate these matters and that was the main reason why we voted for recommittal. Perhaps most important. we should observe that what the Post Office Department needs is a thorough study by a competent commission. involving peole from both inside and outside the Government. to find ways and means to cut out duplication. modernize the Department. and take advantage of presentday technology for more efficient operation. By the first of the year. I expect to introduce a bill calling for such an investigation. The motion to recommit having failed. I reluctantly voted for the bill because I was committed to support improved salaries for postal workers. They have been denied the recognition they deserve. and their salaries have been adversely affected by inflation which is caused more by Government policies than by anything else. Their plight has made it dfficult to recruit and train postal employees.",

On page 1046 you will find that Mr. John A. Baker. Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. on March 14. testified as follows: I would like to comment on our part of the Job Corps program. We are quite pleased with the overall progress to date. Our Centers are now in full swing. even though the Job of getting them established turned out to be larger and to take longer than we expected. Much of the work. such as landscaping. sidewalks. roadways. and utility buildings was accomplished by the corpsmen. Administration of the Centers is settling down into a more routine operation. Corpsmen incidents are fewer. Community acceptance appears to be on the upswing. About 113 Job Corps graduates have been employed by the Forest Service in such positions as engineer aid. fire control aid. resident worker. cook helper. and forest worker. Corpsmen graduates are consistently being placed in better jobs than those they previously held. enlisting in the military or entering school. In most cases. by the time an enrollee becomes a corpsman. he is making significant personal improvement. On January 31. 1967. there were 7.287 corpsmen in centers adminIstered by the Forest Service. I have asked Mr. Cliff to comment briefly on a few significant accomplishments during the past fiscal year. He and his staff will be glad to answer any questions that you may have.",

You wonder sometimes at the cost of the Job Corps camps. but they have to have the teachers for the firstgrade level. secondgrade level. thirdgrade level. this type of thing. And speaking of the other parts of the country. I am sympathetic with the problem. but yet about 40 percent of the trainees in that camp were from the east coast and -were boys who had no opportunity in their own communities. They were moved into the West where there is not much feeling about status and so on. and they had found themselves. There was a young man from Richmond who was a high school graduate. He was the supervisor of the office. Until he went to the Job Corps camp he had no chance for a job at all. It was a fine experience to watch him. The day that I was there. nine of the boys had just been employed by one of the biggest timber companies. You know what their contribution in taxes will be because the minimum wage I believe in those lumber camps is $2.60 an hour. So they went from nothing to $2.60 as a base and undoubtedly they went higher. I saw them learning carpentry. They had a practical construction man as supervisor. and each of them was handling some phase of the building of their own gymnasium. I saw the boys who were interested in the Forest Servicethe construction of trails. fire trails. and construction of bridges. It was a fine example of the best kind of a work training program. I was interested in another way they were teaching them. They were not spending onehalf day in the forest and then doing a halfday in the school. The schoolwork was set aside in a special grouping for 1 or 2 days. and then they would do the forest work. They could retain their scholastic interest and their training and then do the forest work.

I am dismayed and alarmed that the administration would once again attempt to hold back highway funds for the Federalaid highway program under the guise of cutting the budget. According to the Secretary of Transportation. no new Federalaid highway projects will be approved until December 1. 1968. in an administration effort to save $200 million toward the $6 billion budgetary slash called for by Congress. Mr. Speaker. this action is a grave disservice to the American public. The highway trust fund. established for the sole purpose of constructing. improving. and maintaining the Interstate and ABC Federalaid systems. is sustained by highway user taxes. It is not part of the general revenue fund of the Treasury and. for this reason. should not be diverted. suspended. or cut back to serve any other needs of the Government. Already the completion date of the Interstate Highway System has been extended beyond its target of 1972 because of numerous delays in the construction program. The need for completion of this System at the earliest possible date is obvious. Further postponements and delays will further aggravate the accident rate and traffic congestion on the Nations highways. increase the cost of highway contruction for mileage postponed. and disrupt planned construction projects entailing the loss of many jobs. The longer that funds are withheld. the greater the impairment to our highway program progress and to the entire economy. The administration has ordered cutbacks on highway funds too many times already. then restored them. then cut them back again. As the American Automobile Association has aptly put it: If the nations interstate highway program is ever going to be completed. it must continue in an orderly. uninterrupted fashion. free from the fiscal yoyo tactics of the present Administration. Use of the highway trust fund for other than specific highway purposes Is not the intent of this Congress. The completion of our highway program is too vital to the safety and well being of our Nation to be toyed with and continually interrupted.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this morning I again observed the Polish vessel. Hugo Kollatai. which delivered supplies to North Vietnam in November of 1966 and which. according to Information supplied me by the Department of Defense. has more than once carried its cargoes to the enemy. doing business in an American port. Last Wednesday I reported on this ships activities in New York where I watched tons of steel stamped \"Made in Poland\" being unloaded on Pier 8 in Brooklyn. Last Friday it was in Philadelphia. Today the vessel is in Baltimore where it is riding high out of the water at Pier 8. Locust Point. and. as I speak to you. this vessel is taking on a cargo of earthenware destined for Holland where. I am told. Dutch designs will be painted on it. Tomorrow this same vessel Is scheduled to call at Norfolk. It has now been some 2 weeks since the Hugo Kollatai first entered our waters. on September 1. at Boston. and I am satisfied that the administration is fully aware of this ships activities. It is apparent to me that the administration could not care less. The only reaction I have noted is a desire to keep the whole sordid business as quiet as possible. This is incredible. Here is a ship. owned and operated by the Polish Government. welcomed in five American ports for business as usual. after it has helped to feed a war machine that has so far cost the lives of over 25.000 Americans. These Communists must be laughing at us all the way to the bank. This kind of trade does not build bridges of understanding. Rather this trade builds the bridges needed for Communist expansion and aggression throughout the world. whether in Vietnam or in Czechoslovakia. As I pointed out in my remarks last Wednesday. the Hugo Kollataj has been blacklisted by the Maritime Administration since January 13. 1967. from carrying U.S. Governmentfinanced cargoes out of the United States. However. the administration for several years has firmly opposed denying such vessels the use of our ports as recommended in my bill. H.R. 365. I have recently addressed a letter to the President urging that this policy be reconsidered and I include it at this point in the RECORD for the information of my colleagues:",

I believe it is quite clear in my conversations with representatives of the Commerce Department that they are making no move whatsoever to reconsider or reevaluate and change controls that now are in existence. I believe that what started off as a temporary voluntary program in 1965. and which now since January of this year has become a mandatory program. is indication that it may be a permanent part of the investment picture overseas. I believe that this would be disastrous to our foreign policy interests. I believe it would be poor from the viewpoint of our traditional thinking about world trade. I also would like to say that it runs absolutely counter to the basic administration philosophy under the Foreign Aid Act which is to try and encourage foreign investment by having foreign insurance programs. insurance against war. insurance against fire. insurance against any loss that might occur overseas. and this runs counter to this policy. So we see the administration in a paradoxical position where under one bill. the foreign aid bill. which we brought before the House just a few weeks ago. we are encouraging foreign investment. then on the other hand under the Executive order of the President in January 1968. we are trying to stabilize private foreign investment.",

I am particularly pleased that many minority members from the Committee on Banking and Currency have joined in sponsoring this resolution. For several months the minority members of the Committee on Banking and Currency have publicly expressed their disagreement with President Johnsons mandatory controls on U.S. corporate Investment abroad. As a matter of fact. as early as February 9 of this year. some 5 weeks after the imposition of these controls. 13 minority members of our committee expressed our opposition to controls on U.S. overseas investment in House Report 1095. At that time we said: The Presidents program of mandatory controls over direct investments dangerously underestimates the importance of emphasizing the need for increased rather than decreased U.S. direct investments abroad in the years ahead. At this late date in second session of the 90th Congress. I see little likelihood of any hearings being scheduled on House Concurrent Resolution 815. Nevertheless. I hope as many Members of the House as possible who agree with our position will join with us in asking that the President lift these controls. I think that this congressional effort will influence the next administration. and to the extent that we make our views known. we might see an early review of the entire balanceofpayments program. Certainly. if nothing else the performance of our seriously declining surplus on the trade account demands a complete review. No figure juggling or statistical gimmicks are going to be convincing to those monetary experts abroad whose policies and actions affect international monetary policy. In closing let me take this opportunity to commend the gentleman from California for taking the initiative in introducing this resolution. Regardless of what happens on election day. in January I shall look forward to his continued support for an early end to these mandatory controls. At this point in the RECORD. Mr. Speaker.

The words that are the subject of this amendment appear on line 19. and the phrase there In full is as follows: These component projects may involve. without limitation. activities providing services. together with necessary related facilitiesand so forth. And then lists successively thereafter six very broad purposes. It seems to me that any program we might want to fund. which has not yet been funded in the area of community action. is described in those six broad areas following the words \"without limitation.\" The words \"without limitation\" open up new additional projects that could be funded. I believe that if there are any projects that are not included in this very broad description that OEO should want to fund in the area of community action. they should come to this Congress to get the authority. Certainly the authority provided in this section Is sufficiently broad so that additional projects that they might want can be funded unless it might be something like the negative income tax they are trying out on an experimental basis in the State of Wisconsin. But. in any event. if they want to go beyond the very broad area of authority now contained in the bill they should come back to this Congress for that authority. rather than to leave OEO without any limitation on the type of project they can fund.

Sixteen CAPs are multicounty organizations which would be adversely affected by the Green amendment. They would probably have to cut representation. I think the situation in Texas is more representative than unique. If this amendment is not adopted then under section 210(a). the CAP agency is the political subdivision. The local political authority. say the city and county politicos. must cut a board of some 150 members back to 51 or less. under the mandate of section 211 (b). In Harris County. 50 members of the board have been elected in the poverty areas. The act. if not amended in this way. would require the politicos to cut this number back to about 17 and to remove at least 99 members of the board.

The other portion of the amendment would require that people employed in a community action program cannot take part in any manner in a labormanagement dispute. either as a strikebreaker or as those who would in any way further the progress of a certified labormanagement dispute.

I reported to this House exactly how the incidences in the city of Providence were so effectively handled and law and order restored completely in 2 days. At that time. I had inserted in the RECORD. newspaper accounts of the incidences and certain statements by the mayor. the chief of police. and the rank and file of the department. All singled out for special commendation the fine assistance given to them by the socalled \"soul patrol\" which was composed of young men who spontaneously reacted to the incidences by working side by side with the police department. The majority of the membership of the soul patrol at that time were associated with the poverty program. either as employees or as elected members of the neighborhood advisory committees. I have in my hand right now police records of members of the soul patrol. Our juvenile code makes privileged the records of many of these young men. However. they have authorized the mayor of Providence to use their names and their records if it will help preserve the poverty program. I have no intention of entering these documents into the RECORD of this House. but I do feel their authorization is a truly significant demonstration of the deep feeling of many people for the continuation of this program. Mr. Chairman. I oppose the first part of my colleagues amendment because many of the people involved who were responsible for deterring these riots and for keeping them down to a minimum disturbance were people with police records. Many of them were associated with the program but were not being paid. some of them were on a payroll. As far as rehabilitation is concerned. I cannot see where one has to wait 5 years. If you are going to tell a man he has to wait 5 years. he may well return to crime.",

The Green provision requires that after June 30. 1967. communities will have to put up 20 percent as their nonFederal share of poverty program costs. Unfortunately. this committee did not see fit to support the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York that would have eliminated the requirement for half cash contributions. The combination of the two Green provisions increasing to 20 percent the proposed local contribution and requiring half that contribution in cash. will kill the program for many needy communities. For example. for the city of Yonkers. these two dilatory Green provisions will mean. based on the first years OEO allotment. the city will have to come up with a local contribution of approximately $240.000. of which $120.000 will have to be contributed in cash. The city of Yonkers Is already desperately hard pressed for funds. having exhausted the entire limit of Its borrowing power. and may well be unable to make the required contribution and hundreds of the citys most needy residents will have to suffer. There are many ways to kill this OEO program besides voting against it. This requirement of a 20percent local contribution plus half in cash would in effect kill the program for many communities which need it the most. It is one of the many very damaging changes included at the instance of the gentlewoman from Oregon which will have the effect of undermining this important program in the guise of its support. I urge the adoption of the amendment.",

Thus. we made the program experimental and limited it to those to whom it may apply. It is sound to deal with people on a basis of not just cutting them off and throwing them out. This is a sound principle. Naturally. when we phase from one principle which is less sound to one that is more sound there will be differences in treatment between peoples.

But in no case could it be over $175 a month for three or more bedrooms.

FHA Administrator Brownstein replied: He will then pay 25% of $7.000And added that the recipient would continue to receive the benefit of rent supplement payments until he reached the economic rent. Thus. until 25 percent of the family income amounts to the total rent. the recipient stays under the rent supplement program. even though he could not have successfully applied for the rent supplement program if his total annual income exceeded $6.100.

The situation is that we gave the President a resolution commending him for resisting aggression and striking back. that we called upon him to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack upon forces of the United States and to repel further aggression. The newspaper accounts at that time were that we expected Hanoi to strike back. and the only way they could do it was with an increased effort against South Vietnam. such as sending their own troops. which they proposed to do. The President. pursuant to that resolution. made a greater and greater effort. The prevailing opinion in this country is that he should have made a greater effort than he made. If one will look at the polls he will see that. That is what the American people think. He should have been doing more. not less. There are some who want us to pull out. There are attacks suggesting that the President does not have the authority to do what he is doing. These attacks do nothing but undermine and weaken this country in time of war.

All of us have been puzzled. if not baffled. as to why a little state such as North Vietnam should seek a deliberate naval conflict with the United States with the overwhelming naval and air power that we have in that area. In an effort possibly to throw some possible light on that question. Mr. Murrey Marder. in his column in the Washington Post yesterday. made the following statement in the closing paragraph of his column: \"North Vietnam on Sunday charged that the United States and South Vietnam had sent warships to shell the Hon Me and Hon Ngu islands in the territorial waters of North Vietnam. Those islands are near the area where the Maddox was attacked Sunday. Hon Me is used as a naval base. American sources said. and Communist PT boats have been seen in the area. \"The United States has denied that any of its warships shelled the islands of Hon Me and Hon Ngu. However. despite some reports published yesterday. the State Department denial did not equally exculpate South Vietnam. It only denied American participation.",

However. in this case. first. the Secretary of Defense himself stated. after the first attack on the Maddox. that he. did not expect a repetition of the attack. He made that statement publicly. That showed how wrong he was. He said he could see no motive for it. and none of us at the first meeting we had on the question could explain why that kind of attack by a few torpedo boats against the elements of the 7th Fleet should take place. whether It was an isolated action or an impulsive action by the local commander. But after the action was repeated. it was shown to be clearly calculated. It is my understanding. as best I can interpret what actually happened. that there were some South Vietnamese raids. if they might be socalledcoastal raids--by South Vietnamese junks or naval vesselsthe only kind of naval vessels they have. My information is that they have relatively small PT boats. comparable to those of North Vietnam. plus what are called motorized junks. and those from time to time have engaged in what are called hitandrun raids. none of them of a major nature. by South Vietnamese boats with South Vietnamese crews. Our own naval vessels. such as the Maddox and other associated vessels. have never engaged in any attacks on those islands or anywhere else in North Vietnam. The best information that I have from high officials in our Government in this field is to the effect that our boats did not convoy or support or backup any South Vietnamese naval vessels that were engaged in such attacks.

What causes difficulty is the fact that this is a new type of war. It is not a war in the orthodox sense. This is subversion. inspired and conducted through infiltration of supplies and men by a neighboring country without a declaration of war. It does not fit the pattern of the traditional way we think of war. It is. nevertheless. aggressiona modernized. specialized kind of aggression. brought to a high degree of perfection by the leader of the Chinese Communists. Mao Tsetung. who established the basic theory of how to conduct this type of warfare. It is difficult to adjust our concepts to warfare of this kind. I think it is just as savage and as much in violation of international good behavior and law as is an overt invasion by troops. I tried to make this point in my remarks. North Vietnam has been an aggressor against South Vietnam. and I do not think so merely because of the testimony in the past 2 or 3 days. Over several years. we have received testimony about what the North Vietnamese were doing in Laos and to a much higher degree in South Vietnam. They had two major ways of approaching South Vietnam. one by sea. and one by ground. The sea approach was the easiest way to supply the Mekong Delta. So we helped the South Vietnam Government try to interrupt the transfer of men and supplies to the Mekong Delta. Junks were built up for that purpose. The boats that may have struck at the coastal areas of North Vietnam may have been supplied by us. We have been helping South Vietnam arm itself. I do not know about the specific boats.

This is the method of billing used by department stores. the big retail chains. catalog houses. and so forth. under which the customer usually makes a specified minimum payment each month and then is charged a credit fee of 11/2 percent per month on his unpaid balance. There are many different ways of setting up these systems. but they generally require a computer and they are not generally used by smaller retailers. Instead. the smaller retailers customarily sell a \"large ticket\" item under an installment sales contract. Under S. 5. the truthinlending bill passed by the Senate on July 11. revolving credit enjoys a special exemption from the requirement that all consumer credit transactions be accompanied by a statement of the annual percentage rate being charged. Revolving credit users. under the Senate bill. may state this charge on a monthly basis instead of an annual rate. But all other types of consumer credit must provide the customer with a statement of the finance charge as an annual percentage rate. The National Appliance and RadioTV Dealers Association is one of many trade associations which opposes the special exemption in the Senatepassed bill for revolving credit. The furniture dealers also oppose it. The banks oppose it. too. H.R. 11601. the Consumer Credit Protection Act. avoids this discrimination by treating all forms of consumer credit in the same manner. requiring an annual percentage rate in all consumer credit transactions. However. the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs split. 6 to 6. on the question of treating all competing forms of consumer credit alike. Chairman WRIGHT PATMAN of the Coinmittee on Banking and Currency has scheduled executive sessions of the full committee beginning next Monday to work on H.R. 11601. Many Members are receiving letters from retailers in their districts and from bankers and others who would be adversely affected by the discriminatory exemption which was in the Senate bill and which is contained also in the truthinlending bills introduced by the six members of the subcommittee who are not sponsors of H.R.",

One of these positions would have been filled by a Navy officer with the rank and grade of rear admiral. lower half. and the other would have been filled by a Marine Corps officer with the rank and grade of brigadier general. The Committee on Armed Services consolidated these two positions into one and provided that the occupant could be either a Navy officer In the grade of rear admiral. lower half. or a Marine Corps officer in the grade of brigadier general. The committee decided not to increase the number of flag officers in the Navy or general officers in the Marine Corps whose confirmations it would recommend to the Senate. Accordingly. the one additional flag or general officer involved in the committee version of the bill would have caused the Navy or the Marine Corps to accommodate this additional flag or general officer within the limitations now applicable. After the committees action the line officers of the Navy and the Marine Corps protested their inability to accommodate an additional uniformed lawyer as a rear admiral or a brigadier general and I have agreed to sponsor an amendment that establishes the two new statutory positions of Assistant Judge Advocate General of the Navy on a permissive basis instead of requiring that they be filled by a flag officer of the Navy or a general officer of the Marine Corps. If those in power in the Navy and the Marine Corps are later persuaded that additional flag or general officer positions should be filled by uniformed lawyers. the authority for flag and general officer grade for the occupants of these offices will exist. My personal view is that the powers that be in the Navy and the Marine Corps are being somewhat shortsighted in their unwillingness to share the flag and general officer positions with uniformed lawyers.

France. the traditional supplier of arms. because of President de Gaulle. refused to sell Israel any airplanes or airplane parts at the outbreak of the 6day war between Israel and the Arab States. De Gaulle has recently made evident his antiSemitic and antiIsrael position. If there is to be peace in the area. another nation must be depended upon to sell Israel military supplies. Sufficient airpower should be made available by the United States to enable Israel to defend itself in the event of the outbreak of hostilities as a result of the failure of the Arab countries to enter into peace negotiations with Israel. In fact. I am sure that if this will be done there will be no renewal of the conflict.",

I asked for this time so as to inform the House Members that the Senateor should I say \"the other body\"-has not yet taken up the foreign aid appropriation bill. Until they do. there can be no conference or conference report. Mr. Speaker. it seems to be the policy almost every year to wait until the very closing hours of the session before final action is taken on the foreign aid appropriation bill. There seems to be a tendency on the part of those who could expedite the handling of this bill to hold it up until the dying hours of a session of the Congress. The spenders seem to think that by delaying final action on the conference report on the foreign aid appropriation bill. they can get an excessive amount of money. whether it has been justified or not. However. I wish to assure the membership of the House that it will be my personal desire to see the Congress remain in session until Christmas Eve as we did once before rather than capitulate to the other body on an amount that has not been Justified other than by the hordes of spenders in the executive branch. To my way of thinking. the American people are sick and tired of the way we are handling their business. This applies not only to the Congress. but also to the executive branch. We are spending money we do not have for things we do not need. trying to be everything to everybody everywhere. and a lot of it on borrowed money.

The Cinderella football team from Indiana University at Bloomington. in my district. has completed one of the most exciting seasons in the schools history. They won nine of their 10 games. a share of the Big 10 title. and earned a berth in the Rose Bowl game at Pasadena. Calif.. on January 1.

Their desire and determination on the football field. I am certain. will stay with them as they make their way in life. Added to the teams honors was the announcement today that their 39yearold coach John Pont has been named Coach of the Year by the football writers of America. Pont must be credited as .author of this fantastic rags to riches story which saw the Hoosiers climb from a 181 season in 1966 to a 91 mark this year. Ponts impressive coaching career at his alma mater of Miami of Ohio. later at Yale and now Indiana University can only reflect on the genuine ability and determination of the man himself. His record of inspiring the young people around him to excel is one which should serve as an example for student and faculty alike across the land. I plan to be on hand at Pasadena on January 1 when Coach Pont and the Hoosiers will take on the Nations No. 2 team from the University of Southern California.

It is of particular interest to note that all of these ships were flying the British flag. With these added five Britishflag vessels. there have now been a total of 68 free world ship arrivals in North Vietnam so far during 1967. The breakdown of these 68 vessels by country is as follows: British. 58. Cyprus. five. Malta. three. and Italy. two. The British may well be in a financial crisis. and they no doubt need to maintain their foreign trade. but so long as the British law will permit the British flag to fly on vessels chartered to Communist interests. they should be held accountable for this trade. Let us make no mistake about it: Every ship flying the British flag. or any other free world ship. that puts its cargo on the docks of North Vietnam is helping the enemies of our country. Simply stated. the British are renting their flag to the Communists. and so long as the British flag continues to fly on ships that are going to North Vietnam. as they have been doing month after month to supply the sinews of war to the Hanoi regime. I cannot get sympathetic with the British over the predicament in which they now find themselves. Mr. Speaker. some means should be found to stop this immoral trade.",

The gentleman from Illinois worked very assiduously and very effectively on this bill in Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the Judiciary. He continued that work during deliberations of the full Committee on the Judiciary. and he was. I may say. in my judgment the most active. the most knowledgeable. and the most farsighted of the conferees in the consideration of this particular proposal. I am troubled by the fact that the hearings held in the Judiciary Committee of the other body do not in any measure whatsoever support the Senate version of o the bill in the two particulars to which the gentleman from Illinois and I object. I am particularly disturbed. in addition. by the fact that these changes were made in the other body without consultation with the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and without any opportunity for responsible officials of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to counsel with our sister group in the other body on the wisdom of these changes. The two changes to which I refer are the changes made in the other body. and accepted by the conferees. which are outlined at the bottom of page 9 and the top of page 10 of the conference report. They are located in the section entitled \"Statement of the Managers on the Part of the House.\" Those two provisions. again for emphasis. are as follows. and they are the two provisions to which the gentleman from Illinois and I object most strenuously. In the first provision the Senate version locates the Federal Judicial Center in the judicial branch of the Government rather than in the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The second provision. to which we except most strenuously. is that which authorizes the director appoint and fix the compensation of professional personnel. rather than. as provided in the House. requiring the board to appoint and fix the compensation of such personnel. Mr. Speaker.

We tried. to use it. and I believe that we presented the only major case ever to come before the Subversive Activities Control Board. which concerned the registration of the Communist Part.

It was no longer a board or a group of men able to function at all actively. Because of the. court decisions. it became really an ineffective adjunct to the Department of Justice or to the investigation of communism. And. after all. thelnvestigation of communism. it seems to me. is and has beerr conducted by the Federal Bureau of 1rrvestigation with a great dear of skill a abili. In view of the record of what has transpiref over the period of the. last 6\"Y. yeats. where there has been a. diligent effort to meet the aims of Congress and use the Shbversive Activitiew Control Board. but due. to court decisions the Board fisnow in. fact:inoperatfve and does not function. it seems to me that to move in. the. dfrection of trying to put it: back into existence. is likely. to. raise. greater questions! that it will resolve. I do not see. that it would make easier the fight against. communism. Having worked closely. with. the Federal- Bureau of Investigation and with. Mr. Yeagleys divisionMr. Yeagleye was head of that division before F came in but- he was reappointed by President Kennedy upon my recommendation. and I. believe- he Is a. very- able manI cannot. perceive. that thestruggleagainst internal communism would be assisted in any way by reactivating the. Subversive Activities Control Board.",

First. let me say that I. too. associate myself with the remarks of the senior Senator from Maine. who speaks with the great authority of long experience. and I admire her succinct statement here today. The thing that I wanted to point out was somewhat similar to what she had to say. Yesterday this body was confronted with a proposed motion to suspend the rule and attach to an appropriation bill a legislative authorization. In fact. the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations was fortified. in that instance. by a vote of his own committee that he make such a motion to suspend the rule. But he withdrew his motion. indicating that he would follow the orderly procedure of a hearing in the other body on the measure. and await its action. Following the withdrawal of his motion by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. the senior Senator from Arizona . it was the Senator from Illinois who stood up to fortify the legislative record by saying that he thought that this was the correct procedure. and he said. among other things: It was said. when this suspension of the rules was proposed. that there was precedent for it. Well. a sin of the past we cannot condone. nor can we pile another sin on top of It and compound it. I think the record has got to show that at least some remonstrance was made at the time in connection with the proposal. Within an hour. the Senator from Illinois was on his feet. asking the Senate to suspend the rule and attach to an appropriation bill a legislative proposal that has not had hearings in this body nor been reported by a legislative committee. and sweep it through as a rider to an appropriation bill. I know that all of us cannot act with complete consistency all of the time. but I have seldom seen inconsistency follow so swiftlyfrom one position to its opposite within an hours time.",

We have always left such matters in the hands of the Committee on the Judiciary. which has its Internal Security Subcommittee. and at least there we have had the basic safeguards of law and lawyers. so that the situation cannot run wild. We have seen examples of that in the very investigations to which the Senator from Maine referred. which involved the late Senator McCarthy. There has been trouble about that In the other body. I say again. I am cognizant of the fact that Investigations could be and would be made of the ultra right as they would be of Communists. I understand that.

It is obvious that most people believe the Hooker site is the site where the dam should be built. and where It undoubtedly will be built. but we are here arguing about some verbiage. or about the name of a dam. And I am somewhat amazed by all of this argument in view of the fact that there is another great conservationist from that great State of New Mexico. who only a few years ago argued and pleaded with the Members of both Houses of the Congress to create a 65millionacre wilderness system which would be inviolate to any kind of activity of any sort which might alter its character. The same conservationist who waged that fight at that time is now the first one to come in and create a precedent in undoing. the Wilderness Act. Mr. Chairman. if this matter is of no great significance we might as well go along with the amendment of the gentleman from Pennsylvania. and at least give some emphasis to trying to protect the wilderness system. If those studies then show. after proper emphasis. that the Hooker site is the proper site where a dam should be built. the fight will have been fought and the battle will have been lost by those who wanted to preserve the wilderness. but nothing will be lost for the project which we are debating today.",

That leaves approximately these 1.3 million acrefeet of water for Colorados future use. Colorados authorization in the Colorado storage project for water use was only 38.000 acrefeet of water. We stood on the provisions of the act and did not complain. But we went to work immediately after that and we have spent Colorado State money and also conservancy districts money of about $6 million since 1956 in order to get our project studies and investigations underway. Most of this money has gone into Bureau of Reclamations control. So what we have left at the present time for future projects is approximately 818.000 acrefeet. This project. the Colorado projects in this bill. will take approximately 378.000 acrefeet. which will then leave Colorado about 440.000 acrefeet for future development. As I tried to explain. when my good friend from Wyoming was in the well. we just do not authorize projectswe do not study them in the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairsand the gentleman from Pennsylvania is responsible for this procedure as well as the rest of us--until we do have planning reports before us.

He got the \"message\" in 1952. and was a tremendous instrument in bringing about some validation of the twoparty tradition in our country and bringing us out of a damaging war. the Korean war. I know Senator CARLSON likes sports analogies. We needed three points.

One thing about FRANK CARLSONS service is an augury for the future which I would like to emphasize. He considers himself as a servant of his colleagues. We cannot do all the things that need to be done. I do not know that Senator CARLSON realizes how refreshing it is when it is made easier for colleagues to have their say and then to perform their responsibilities in the work of another committee because of the intercession of so able. so sympathetic and so understanding a Member as Senator CARLSON has proved to be. This is one of the nicest things that has happened to me in the Senate. I think it is true of many other Senators. For the future.

Claude Fuller had a most productive life and he continued to serve in many ways. He remained at work in banking until a month before his death at the age of 91. He continued to take part in civic affairs. and as a Rotarian myself. I appreciated the leadership given by Claude Fuller in Rotary work and in many other worthwhile endeavors.

Many of President Johnsons critics claim that Americas closest allies in the world are opposed to the administration. especially its policies in Vietnam. These claims are greatly exaggerated. As the Economist points out: President Johnson is a global American. This is the real issue of the election . .. the Americans will have to make up their minds what they want to do in the world. On Vietnam. the Economist rightly notes that the President is going into 1968 with a policy \"that still commands the support of a majority of Americans.\" If the President holds this supportand there is every reason to think he willit will mean. in the Economists words. that the American people \"do not believe that this war is a struggle for the future of a single country.\" And says the Economist: The signs are that a majority of Americans may be willing to accept that what has happened in Viet Nam cannot be separated from what might happen in Thailand and Malaysia and even India . . . that this is. in fact. the war for Southern Asia. Americas willingness to maintain Its commitment in Vietnam. no matter the cost and frustration. may indicate the Nations willingness \"to do for Asia in the 1970s what it did for Europe in the 1940s and early 1950s.\" And. it adds: Mr. Johnson wants to be reelected to do just that.

Mr. Speaker. while the Congress stood in recess. the Supreme Court rendered a decision in the case of Katz against the United States. That decision leaves me with mixed emotions. On one count. I applaud it warmly. it puts at rest. I think. forever. the question about the constitutionality of legislation such as that proposed in the McCullochFord bill which would authorize the use. under court order. of electronic surveillance in the investigation of specifically named crimes. I am somewhat less pleased with the thrust of the Katz decision. however. in that it went far beyond the point the courts have previously been willing to go with respect to the extension of the seizure clause of the fourth amendment. Whether that decision was wise or unwise is moot. It is a fact. It is now the responsibility of the Congress of the United States to deal with the question of legislation implementing the permission granted by the Katz decision to conduct courtcontrolled electronic surveillance. In other words. Mr. Speaker. the ball has been passed and I suggest that if we as Members of the Congress of the United States are to discharge our responsibilities properly in the field of law enforcement. we will deal with this issue this year.",

The President has indicated his very great concern which I think is shared by every Member of this House. One very helpful step. in my opinion. would be to eliminate the existing requirement that the Federal Reserve banks maintain certain reserves in gold certificates against Federal Reserve notes. Removal of this requirement would give the United States an additional $10 billion to meet foreign -demands for gold. Today. there Is only about $1.1 billion available for this purpose since our gold holdings have declined to approximately $11.9 billion. of which $10.8 billion is tied up by the Federal Reserve note requirement. This requirement is an anachronism. dating back to the time when America operated on the gold standard. Since the Federal Reserve notes held by American citizens no longer are redeemable in gold. the gold cover statute is not applicable to todays monetary system. The elimination of this requirement will not solve the balanceofpayments problem but it will buy time to enable us to determine what is the proper course we should follow. Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to effect the removal of this requirement. and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

On January 7. 1968. the New York Daily News ran a story entitled. \"A Prisoners Secret Book Indicts Soviet Persecution.\" which should help to emphasize the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system. Written by 29yearold Vyacheslav Chornovil who was sentenced to a 3year term at a secret trial. the manuscript details the cases of 20 individuals whose trials Chornovil attended as a secretary of the Young Communist League. When he protested that the secret trials were illegal. Chornovil also became the victim of Soviet \"justice.\" Fortunately. Chornovil managed to smuggle his account of the trials out of the Soviet Union and his manuscript will be translated into English for publication in the free world. According to the manuscript the arrests of Soviet dissenters was more widespread than generally realized: In the summer of 1965. there was a wave of arrests throughout the Ukraine of intellectuals. writers. teachers and scientists. Six months later most of them were brought to trialwhich under the Soviet constitution was illegaland sentenced to terms of up to six years. Perhaps those dissenters here in the United States who have been curiously silent about Soviet abuses will choose to dissent. along with the rest of us. on behalf of the Soviet dissenters.

I want to extend my congratulations to the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. the gentleman from Texas and to the other managers on the part of the House for their leadership and foresight in deleting in conference the Senate provision limiting indirect costs under Federal research grants and contracts. This provision would have had farreaching implications and could have affected the entire research posture of the country. I believe it is important. therefore. that it has been removed from the Defense Appropriations Act. At the same time. I recognize that this issue has not been finally resolved. and that it may be raised again in future appropriations acts. Consequently. the Science Subcommittee plans to look into the issue of indirect costs again. and we will report to the Congress the results of our study. I believe it is important to take into consideration that once before we had an indirect cost limitation on research grants. However. after extensive hearings of the Science Subcommittee on the effect of the limitation. and through the efforts of the late Representative John E. Fogarty and the other members of the House Appropriations Committee. this provision was removed from the appropriation acts beginning in fiscal year At that time. Bureau of the Budget revised Circular A21 which provides guidelines for handling indirect costs for research grants and contracts. and issued Circular A74 which provides guidelines for cost sharing by universities receiving Federal research grants. We knew at the time these guidelines were Issued that it would take a period of time before they could be properly implemented because of the different accounting systems then in use. Since that time we have followed their development. and they have now. I believe. reached the point of being reasonably firm. We will. however. look into the way this has been managed and. then. if necessary conduct another study to determine the current situation and to see if it has in fact changed since our hearings in 1964. Mr. Speaker. I again wish to commend the managers on the part of the House. I think they have done a great service. and I include at this point in the RECORD my correspondence with Congressman MAHON and Senator MANSFIELD which outlines in more detail the background on the indirect cost issue:",

World War II. and the Korean conflict. It will enable the noncitizen veteran to be naturalized without satisfying a residence requirement. He must serve honorably and have been either legally within the United States when he enlisted or a lawfully admitted permanent resident. Enactment of this report will give foreign nationals serving in Vietnam fair naturalization treatment. They should obviously be afforded the same benefits as those who served our country in other wars. The bill recommended by the conference report extends those naturalization benefits to anyone having military service during a period designated by the President as a period in which the Armed Forces of the United States were engaged in military operations involving armed conflict with hostile foreigh forces. This is consistent with the existing provisions of section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act which it proposes to amend. This section represents a long legislative history which has made service during prescribed periods the sole criterion for eligibility. Moreover. this report contains a provision to exempt members of the Armed Forces who would be eligible for naturalization under the provisions of this report from the payment of naturalization fees. The Subcommittee on Immigration and Nationality has spent considerable time on this proposal. It is only just that Vietnam veterans be treated the same as those of other wars. Therefore.

During most of that time the pending matter has been a simple motion made by the junior Senator from South Dakota that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Senate Resolution 6. That resolution. which we are asking the Senate to consider. was introduced by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and me on the opening legislative day of the session. It provides that after a reasonable period. debate could eventually be terminated by the votes of threefifths of the Senate instead of the present requirement of twothirds. There is nothing revolutionary or radical or even very liberal about this proposal. Indeed. its chief characteristic is its caution and its conservatism. As the editor of the Washington Post put it in an editorial on January 13: The most striking aspect of the antifilibuster fight in the Senate is the extreme conservatism of the reforms offered. Mr. President. on last Wednesday. the Vice President. while fully respecting the dignity. the constitutional rights. and the regular procedures of the Senate. made it clear that In his judgment there is a parliamentary method under which the Senate can work its will to terminate extended debate if a majority wishes to do so at the beginning of a new Senate. The Vice President cannot be faulted by either liberals or conservatives for the manner in which he presided over our deliberations last week. The day may come when Senators are sufficiently fed up by some long and empty filibuster so that they will take advantage of the procedure outlined by the Vice President.

What happened? Those Representatives either did not run again. they were defeated in the primaries. or they were defeated in the general election. The repeal of section 14(b) could not be rammed through the Senate. The reason they could not do so was that we kept it alive until the country became aware of what was involved in the bill. That is when the mail by the millions began to hit the Senate. and where as many nonunion members as union members participated in that great flow of mail. to let the Senate know how they felt about repealing section 14(b). If we had not had the twothirds rule. it would have been a different story. Thus. it is a protective device not merely for the Senate but also for the people of the United States of America.

Celestine Sibley. an Atlanta institution herself. has written a heartwarming. informative. and at times. very amusing account of the store that married a city and their century of happy life together. Mr. Speaker. the successful growth of Richs has been an exciting story. Currently one of the largest department stores in the United States. Richs was founded in 1867 with a $500 borrowed investment. This week. Richard H. Rich. grandson of the stores founder and present chairman of the board. announced a $115 million expansion plan to be carried out over the next 10 years. The plan is based on projections that the stores volume will grow from $150 million annually in 1967 to $200 million annually by Mr. Speaker. the announced expansion and celebration of 100 years of service by a great Georgia institution are a tribute to Richs management and further attest to the faith that all Georgians have in the continued growth prosperity. and development of our State. There is a statue in our Nations Capital which bears the inscription. \"What Is Past Is Prologue.\" A taxi driver was asked by a visitor to Washington what that meant. and he quite appropriately replied. \"It means. you aint seen nothing yet. \" The first century of Richs has been great. and I predict. with my taxi driver friend. that the second century will prove that \"you aint seen nothing yet.\" I join in congratulating the management and the employees of Richs on a job well done.",

We felt that until Congress had some understanding of how such a system would be applied. it was best to leave intact the present system. which Is. of course. a lottery. but one employed by natureby date of birthas the Senator understands. Within a designated age group. inductions start with the oldest ones first. and go down. to the youngest. That is the present system. I have no doubt that It can be improved upon.
