On that day 83 years ago. a proud country finally regained the independence it had lost several centuries before. I will tell these people that in the modern history of the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula. there has been a continual record of subjugation. This ugly record finally was broken late in the 19th century. Siding with the victorious Russians in the RussoTurkish War. Bulgaria was able to obtain its independence. By the Treaty of San Stefano. Bulgarias freedom was guaranteed. Thus. the Bulgarians after over five centuries of foreign domination were finally liberated by the Russians. It is one of the sad ironies of history that today Russia. under Communist rule. dominates Bulgaria. After suffering the miseries of two World Wars Bulgaria still is not free. As a result of the Second World War she lost her freedom in the peace that followed to the very country which claimed to have liberated her. It is within the context of the modern plight of Bulgaria that March 3 looms so large upon the horizon as a symbol of freedom. Today in Bulgaria there is no more liberty than under Turkish rule. and it is tragic that even in a country so desirous of freedom it cannot exist. Let us all pray that the brave Bulgarian people will soon be able to realize their heritage of freedom that we today are commemorating. Bulgarian Liberation Day",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to the people of Bulgaria and to Americans of Bulgarian descent on the 83d anniversary of the liberation of Bulgaria from the yoke of the decaying Ottoman Empire. On March 3. 1878. the Treaty of San Stefano between imperial Russia and Ottoman Turkey reestablished the Bulgarian nation after 500 years of foreign oppression. Although the frontiers of the new nation were narrowed by the subsequent Congress of Berlin. the modern Bulgarian nation then came into existence. The liberation of Bulgaria followed a long struggle by gallant patriots. which won the sympathy and support of the free nations of the West. led by the great British Prime Minister William Gladstone. A freely elected national assembly adopted the democratic Tirnovo Constitution over the opposition of czarist Russia. This democratic constitution was finally destroyed by the Communist satellite regime which was imposed on Bulgaria at the end of World War II. From the time of their liberation from Turkish rule to the present day. the Bulgarian people have resisted the aggressive pressures of Russian imperialism. both czarist and Communist. At the end of World War II a Communist satellite regime was imposed on Bulgaria by the Red army. The Soviet Union violated its solemn promise in Bulgaria as it did all throughout Eastern Europe and permitted no free elections to be held. The Bulgarian people. like all of the subjugated peoples of the Soviet Empire. retain their hope and faith in ultimate liberation. The Bulgarian National Front of America. which represents the patriotic younger generation in Bulgarian politics. has since 1954 organized solemn observations of Bulgarian Liberation Day in America. It is eminently fitting. Mr. Speaker. that we in this body join with our fellow Americans of Bulgarian descent. with the Bulgarian people who bear the yoke of an alien totalitarianism. and with all freemen in commemorating the day of Bulgarian liberation from Ottoman tyranny and in expressing the hope that the day of Bulgarian liberation from Communist tyranny will not be long delayed.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Bulgarians are the most resourceful and defiant fighters against all their enemies. but they are perhaps best known as gallant warriors against their oppressors. Their little country in the Balkans was a powerful kingdom during the middle ages. and they constituted a real power there for centuries. Then early in the 15th century as the Ottoman Turks overran the Balkan Peninsula and parts of southern Europe. Bulgaria became an Ottoman province in the Ottoman Empire. and the Bulgarians a resolute minority struggling against Ottoman despotism. For more than 400 years they carried on their struggle against formidable odds. and all these attempts ended in failure because without effective outside help they could not cope with the then powerful Ottoman forces. In the RussoTurkish War of 187778 they had their chance. The Bulgarians were fighting on the side of the Russians. for the war was waged in the name of the Balkan peoples. Early in 1878 the Turks were thoroughly vanquished. and when Russia was dictating her peace terms. she insisted upon Bulgarian freedom. Thus their freedom was guaranteed in the treaty signed on March 3. 1878. and since then Bulgarians everywhere. in and out of their homeland. think of that day as their holiday and celebrate it as such. Since those days the Bulgarian people have endured much misery. have gone through two devastating World Wars. and both of these have had tragic consequences for them. Today. after all the sufferings and sacrifices. they are not free in their homeland. Even so. these stanch fighters for freedom. these dauntless and hardy peasants. under the most oppressive of tyrannies continue to work and hope for their eventual freedom. There under Communist totalitarianism. and totally sealed off from the free world. they work for their ruthless taskmasters. yet cling to their most cherished ideal. their freedom and independence. It is sad but true that while they attained their freedom with the aid of czarist Russian forces 83 years ago. today they are robbed of their freedom in their homeland by Communist Russian agents. All friends of freedomhungry Bulgarian people hope that they will again regain their freedom and live in peace in their homeland. Area Redevelopment: A Must in 1961",

The principal one is that the interior structural work in Bancroft Hall. particularly in wing 6. was found to be in such condition that it had to be virtually completely removed and a new system of interior partitions. floors. ceilings. et cetera. was required. The original approach had been to try to salvage as much of the old as possible and patch it up. We had to drop that approach and go into a complete replacement. In addition to this. other conditions were found which added to the cost.

They said. \"We are plowing new ground. and we do not have the necessary guidelines. and this is the first year of operation.\" So we said we would eliminate the restrictions voted by the House. and would take the item to conference. But we put them on notice that in the conference we shall ask that the services be allowed to proceed for 1 year on an experimental basis. while trying to live within the guidelines laid down by the House. but being given the necessary flexibility for 1 year. if they cannot live within those guidelinesbut with the understanding that next year we shall firm this up. in light of the further experience which will be had by that time.

I. on August 23. wrote to the President calling his attention to this matter and suggested that he might take action to release these funds. It appears that the limitation on the use of available funds was based on the assumption that the program for rural housing loans was a 4year program and. therefore. available funds should be spread over a 4year period. This. of course. is a complete misrepresentation of the 1961 Housing Act. which established a fund of $428 million to provide direct Federal housing loans for families in rural areas where normal sources of credit are not otherwise available. There is nothing in the law. nor was it the intention of those of us who sponsored the 1961 Housing Act. that the terminal date of 1965 for this program would imply that funds should be parceled out over a 4year period. Mr. President. I am pleased to announce to the Senate that at 3 oclock today an announcement was made by Secretary Freeman that an additional $152 million will be made available for rural housing loans. Todays action makes a total of $182 million available through the Farmers Home Administration for this type of credit during fiscal I am. of course. delighted that the President has seen fit to release these funds. for I think they will be of great benefit to many of our people who live in rural areas. and.

My particular comment is this: A facility of expression in English is obviously supremely important for every American. but I think the time has arrived in the development of this globe when a facility to express oneself in a second language is almost Indispensable. surely so with respect to men and women representing our country in foreign lands. both in the military and the civilian establishment. The Defense Department has seen fit. after urging by the subcommittee. the chairman of which is the Senator from Mississippi. to consolidate its language functions at the Presidio at Monterey. Calif. There. Mr. President. with all the modern. efficient techniques of teaching. men and women in the military services may learn to speak. to understand. and to express themselves orally and in writing in all those many tongues which are represented in the areas to which American military personnel in uniform today are required to go. This year the Department of Defense and the Bureau of the Budget under this administration recommended an increase or an expansion in the facilities there. I believe I should say not merely as a Californian but also as an American that I am most grateful the subcommittee and then the full Committee on Appropriations approved and included that particular item. I think it is completely correct to say. considering the teaching techniques by the Army. representing all of the services in the development of the ability of men and women in the military services to speak more than one language. that this facility constitutes an increasingly important part of Americas Defense Establishment. For that in particular. I say to the Senator from Mississippi. I know the Defense Department once again is indebted to his leadership.

I doubt if many Senators know what can be found in the books I have before me. For any Senator who wishes to go through them. I have before me more than 1.000 pages of classified information about the program. Some pages have hundreds of figures.

That subcommittee dealt only with what the United States was building for our own armed services.

The Battle Act was passed by the Congress in 1951. and. if I recall correctly. was amended in 1956. and was also amended by the Senate on May 11 of this year. In every instance. this issue has come up. In the Battle Act there is a reservation which gives the President of the United States the right to waive this prohibition against trading with Communist bloc countries. provided he finds it is in the interest of our own national security to waive it. The vital part of the pending amendment would take away from the President the right to waive that prohibition. The amendment reads in part as follows: Notwithstanding any other provision of law. no assistance shall be furnished under this act to any country which exports or knowingly permits the exportationTo one of the Iron Curtain countries. and so forth. The words \"nothwithstanding any other provision of law\" would eliminate the right of the President to waive the prohibition. and I believe we should .have that point in mind. In short. the amendment. if adopted. would be a long step backward.",

He has appeared on many occasions before the Committee on Science and Astronautics. as he did before other committees. to explain simply and thoroughly the possibilities of such research and the importance of an urgent prosecution of this effort. He clearly understood the importance of constantly expanding the horizons of basic research. which is bound to be the principal determinant of progress in future decades. both in the military art and in industry and commerce. He encouraged full use of the national resources in the Governmentsponsored activities and worked hard to increase the participation of colleges. universities and research institutions in the program. The House recalls his distinguished combat record. his assumption of grave responsibilities in the intelligence field at a time when military agencies had been under critical fire for what some believed to be a failure to be sufficiently aggressive in this important field. and the numerous assignments he has discharged with skill.

Apparently he has not read the record for the last 36 years for during that period the Federal Government ended up its fiscal year 25 times with deficits and 11 times with surpluses. During these same years. using the consumer price index as perhaps the best indicator of inflation. we have had 25 years in which the price index increased denoting inflation. with 10 decreases and 1 year where the index was stationary. There certainly must be some relationship between the surpluses and the years of inflation. Also the deficits certainly have a very direct relationship to the outflow of gold for in 1958 when we had the largest peacetime defict in our history. the foreigners took $2.3 billion of our gold in lieu of dollars. This year we are experiencing the second largest peacetime deficit in our history. and the gold continues to be withdrawn. I think Henry J.

Obviously. the vast majority of people resent any inhibition of any kind upon their personal and religious beliefsand this decision was played up as such. Hitherto the Court has been mindful of widespread effects of decisions and at times has declined to rule on the meticulous language of some statute. Just why the Court assumed the responsibility of ruling in this case is not clear.

I wish to call attention to the pendency before the Interstate Commerce Commission of a request for regulations which will seek at long last to end segregation in bus terminals and everything connected with interstate bus transportation. Some time ago I introduced into the ICC explaining its proposed procedure on this subject. These regulations are absolutely essential to give legal basis for the elimination of this blot on the American escutcheon. discrimination against foreign travelers and domestic travelers as well. The ridiculous efforts to pretend that this discrimination applies only to intrastate passengers are a defiance to our good sense and judgment and make a laughingstock of our concepts that affect the Constitution. Every Senator who feels deeply on this subject should in his own way evidence his feeling to the ICC that such regulations must be adopted. I ask unanimous consent that an editorial on this subject published in the New York Times of today be printed in the RECORD at this point in my remarks. Never again should we allow any traveler at home or abroad feel that even in interstate travel. between States. Negroes must take a back seat.",

    "speech": "I was glad to hear the Senators speech. When a similar amendment was before the Senate a few days ago. relating to the development loan fund. I voted against it. I did so on the thesis that the congressional review of specific projects was not a task for the Congress. and that their validity was the responsibilty of the administration and its foreign aid agency. I had the idea that after the executive branch had spent time negotiating and coming into agreement with other countries regarding specific programs. and perhaps had negotiated with third countries. contributions to the programs. it would be a rather doubtful process to bring the proposed loans before the Senate and the House for consideration and for approval or disapproval.. I think -it . an Executive. rather than a legislative function to administer the foreign aid program. I could foresee that the debate and discussion of a particular program in a particular country by the Senate and House might revolve around considerations not applicable to the conduct of foreign policy. which is the responsibility of the President. I was surprised that the administration left the position it had taken. It had taken a position against the proposal for congressional review. The chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations took the floor and said he approved congressional review and voted for it. As the administration changed its positionand it didI shall change mine. and I shall vote for the Senators proposal. Upon reflection. congressional review may not have the adverse effect which I had contemplated. It may establish standards and warnings which will lead the administration to present and enforce a better program. When we have finished with the bill and have done all possible to write legislation making it possible and have a more effective aid program. the success of the foreign aid program will rest at last with the executive branchupon its careful planning. upon its review of the plans and projects proposed by other countries. and upon its efforts to secure contributions by other countries. for the United States cannot bear the entire burden. I will support the amendment of the Senator from Vermont.",

Let me cite what happened in the House. when the House. by a teller vote. restored the annual authorization and appropriation feature. That was offered by one who. I believe. Is still a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House. He was born in India. and is now a naturalized American. Naturally. he has a sentimental interest in the part of the earth where he was born. He is concerned with the problems which exist in the underdeveloped countries. But I believe probably out of a sense of sheer frustration at his inability and the inability of the other members of the committee to obtain specific information and details concerning these programs. he felt compelled to take the action he did in the House of Representatives. If the members of the committee are frustrated and concerned over the lack of information available to them. it is no wonder that the American people. or at least a large segment of them. are opposed to this program as a matter of principle. particularly when they read of the many examples of extravagance. waste. and poor administration which have been evident for so many years. I think the amendment of the Senator from Illinois will shed a great deal of light on the program. and it may gain the support of the American people when they know that Congress has full details and information about what is going on and how the money will be spent. before it has been spent.

I want it clearly understood that there is a distinction between applying that provision about oversight to the lending part of the program and applying it to the procedure under the Appropriations Committees. particularly when the Appropriations Committees would have control of it under the Government Corporation Control Act. This amendment would subject the grantaid support and assistance part of the program to this further check. and that would create very serious mechanical and bookkeeping problems for the committees. I think we can trust the Appropriations Committees to evaluate these programs. as they have been doing all along.

So far as my committee is concerned. we go over the reports once. and I think that is sufficient. I see no justification for having more. The procedure proposed by the amendment is not comparable to that in connection with the lending program. which is on a lending basis and a 5year authorization basis. In connection with a lending program it is not possible to state In advance every loan that will be made. Neither could a bank do so. That will depend on the applicants. and so forth.

In the short span of a human lifetime. he realized his highest ambition and became Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States. He is so indelibly a part of this House. it seems incredible he is not actually present here among us any longer. SAM RAYBURNS career in Congress covered decades of history which helped to bring America to prominence as a world power. He served with Woodrow Wilson. Herbert Hoover. Franklin Roosevelt. and he was an integral part of Americas expansion and development. The good people of Bonham. Tex.. deserve the thanks of a grateful Nation for having the wisdom to see his talents fulfilled. Three generations of voters recognized his capacity for leadership and they willingly sent him to serve the Nation. The qualities which made up his character and temperament will be models for legislators for generations to come. His loyalty to truth and a welldefined code of honor. his basic integrity. his ability to inspire confidence. and above all his sincere love of this giant and varied land are symbols of statesmanship which have been willed to each of us and to all those who will follow after US. We have inherited a legacy of greatness. It is to SAM RAYBURNs everlasting credit that he placed the highest importance upon serving these United States with the best of himself. We. who are entrusted with carrying on the burdens of statecraft. will dishonor his memory if we fail to live up to his confidence in us.",

In short. commonsense has had a part in the development and strength of our legal system and the respect for law which characterizes our society. When this tradition is disregarded it can only result in weakening the legal system and diminishing respect for it. Apparently the U.S. Court of Claims determined there was adequate precedent and legal reasoning to support a judgment denying Army pay to certain Korean POWs who defected to the Communists. Yet the Supreme Court of the United States has overturned that decision and ordered payments by the U.S. Government to the very persons who dishonorably turned against it. I share with the writer of the following editorial appearing in the Los Angeles Herald Express on May 25 his difficulty in understanding why the Supreme Court should render such a decision.",

I am happy to join with millions of wellwishers in this country and abroad to extend felicitations and warmest greetings to our Chief Executive. With it go my sincerest wishes that the year ahead may prove to be a year of great achievement for him and for our Nation. It is said that every period of crisis in the Nations history brings forth its men of great vision and ability. We are fortunate indeed to have a man of the vision and stature of President Kennedy to lead our people at this crucial period in human affairs. I feel certain that under his leadership and guidance we can look forward to the future with courage and determination that our national goals will be achieved. On the eve of his departure for Europe. where he is to meet with the great French statesman General de Gaulle. with Soviet Premier Khrushchev and others. we wish him godspeed and success in his endeavors in behalf of world peace. Together with these wishes. go our assurances that the American people are united behind him and fully support him in these efforts. Millions in this country will be praying for his success. It is perhaps coincidental. but nevertheless momentous. that this mission to Europe should begin on his 44th birthday. Not many men in all of history. in all nations. have reached the pinnacle of leadership of a great nation at the age of 44. President Kennedy has emerged on the world scene as the leader of the greatest and the most powerful nation of all times at this relatively young age. and that is due to his great leadership. his ability. his understanding of world problems. and his unceasing desire to make this world a safer and a happier place for all mankind. May the good Lord bless him and his family with many years of good health. May we be privileged to benefit of his able leadership and wise counsel in the years ahead. and may he succeed in leading our Nation from strength to strength. Let us hope that America. under President Kennedy. and the whole world. will truly enjoy genuine peace and cooperation for the welfare of all of humanity.

I observed that the recent successful action of the House and Senate on controversial legislation requested by the Kennedy administration would indicate the number of newly authorized Federal judges has been carefully estimated and skillfully distributed throughout the country. It could be a mere coincidence. of course. that the necessary 10 or more votes to insure safe passage of the costly Kennedy bills are now available whenever the trumpet sounds. Only a few days ago it took telephone calls to Congressmen from Cabinet members. and even from the White House itself. to pass a Kennedy measure. The feeling prevailing among the conservatives is that the judgeship bill was carefully programed after the first Kennedy legislative defeat in the House. With the pending appointment of 70 new Federal judges to use as pawns in this great game called politics. the Kennedy team can now maneuver for the votes necessary to pass almost any legislation it wants. Therefore. I was most interested to note the following editorial which appeared in the May 11. 1961. issue of the Christian Science Monitor newspaper. entitled \"Justice Above Spoils.\" The editorial covers another important aspect of the hurried enactment of the judgeship bill. which has been pending even before I came to Congress in 1954. the editorial follows:",

Everywherefrom Newfoundland to the Yukon territorieseditors. businessmen. politicians. and intellectuals. of the left. right. and center. are critical of what they envisage as the cultural and economic colonization of their nation by the United States. This apprehension is not prompted by concern over some fanciful territorial encroachment. Nor do Canadians realistically fear any overt international bullying on the part of this Nation. No people have better cause to trust American justice and fairness than do the Canadians. Rather. the wellsprings of worry and alarm are complex and more sophisticated. They reflect an overriding concern that an expansive. effervescent and beneficent United States. approximately 15 times the size of its neighbor. will ultimately absorb the Canadian identity into its ownand do so with the noblest motivations. First open warning of the trend toward undesirable homogenization of Canadian and American identities came early in 1950. Lester B.

    "speech": "Mr. President. dairy farmers of New York State and the Nation are anxiously awaiting the special message on agriculture which the President is expected to send to the Congress on or about January 30. While the specific recommendations for farm program changes are still in the process of formulation. there have been enough leaks and informed source newspaper stories to indicate rather conclusively that radical changes in the present dairy price support program will be urged by the administration. The Presidents budget message of a few days ago further confirms this view. It is reported that the administration will propose a new dairy program which would sharply restrict the amount of milk the individual dairy producer will be permitted to market. This is the supplymanagement concept which has been advocated by administration farm policy planners for various commodities. without success. during the past year and a half. It is essentially a production control operation which would. in effect. tell the farmer how many cows he could milk and how much milk he could sell. Dairy farmers are rightfully concerned over the fact that milk production has been trending sharply higher during the last year while per capita consumption has been declining. On Tuesday both the President and the Secretary of Agriculture indicated that Americans should consume more milk to meet their minimum health requirements. More milk consumption is a highly desirable goal. I am. of course. concerned that consumers get good safe milk at fair prices. However. the possibility of sweeping national production controls on dairy products and other farm commodities is a new departure. I am worried about the impact which such a program would have upon our present reasonable and orderly milk marketing arrangements in the Northeast. If we are to have production controls at all. they must come from the grassroots. They must be approved by men on the farm. not ordained by remote control from Washington. As one New York farmer put It to me. a small brain closer to the farm Is better than a big brain in Washington. Before we start setting up sweeping production controls. we had best have a hard look at what we are doing.",

Its purpose is to \"remove the present inequitable restriction on the right of unions in the building and construction industry to engage in peaceful picketing at the site of a construction job.\" My reason for opposing it is that it would permit secondary boycotts in the construction industry. I have carefully studied this proposal for over a year. and I have concluded that the proposal would go far beyond even the stated purpose of its proponents. it would infringe on the right of the American public to be protected from secondary boycotts as expressed under the provisions of the TaftHartley Act as amended by the LandrumGriffin Act. Hearings are being conducted now by the House Committee on Education and Labor. It is likely that this bill will soon be brought to the floor.

I have listened to this brief debate on agriculture with a great deal of interest. coming from a district that does not have one farm in it and. particularly. in view of the fact that I have been a consistent supporter of farm legislation. It seems to me the gentleman from Minnesota . so far as the accusation which the gentleman from Illinois made. met that accusation effectively. It seems to me. efforts to improve the lot of the agricultural community of our country should not be met with a constant cry of socialism. That is a cry I have heard in my 33 years in this body. I have heard the cry of socialism against minimum wage legislation. I have heard the cry of socialism against housing legislation. I have heard the cry of socialism against every progressive piece of legislation that has come before this body in the last 33 years. It does seem to me it is about time some other arguments could be devised and made against progressive legislation other than trying to create the fear of socialism. Certainly. those of us who tried to improve the lot of the farmer years ago did not vote for socialistic legislation. particularly those of us who come from urban districts. Certainly. those of us who voted for the minimum wage and who are now voting for the depressed areas legislation and who are voting for these progressive measures feel there is nothing socialistic about these measures.

Ninety percent or more of the districts collections come from the twin ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. according to a foreign trade survey prepared by the Union Bank of Los Angeles. Imports through the twin ports have increased more than 600 percent since 1946. Yet. importers and exporters shipping through the port of Los Angeles or the port of Long Beach are subject to delays and inconveniences found in no other port in the United States. The Los Angeles Customs District headquarters is located 22 miles from the harbor area. in the trafficclogged center of Los Angeles. This means that importers and brokers have to break up shipments and send part of their merchandise 22 miles inland for examination and appraisal. This means paperwork has to be shuttled between the customhouse and the harbor by messenger and that customs personnel waste time in unnecessary travel. New customs facilities have been proposed for Los Angeles. Now is the time to eliminate the 22mile bottleneck. and to establish the Los Angeles Customhcuse in the harbor it serves. Yet the General Services Administration and the Customs Service are planning to perpetuate these difficulties and retain the 22mile bottleneck by placing the new customs facilities in a new Federal building planned for construction at the Civic Center. downtown Los Angeles.

Master planning. personnel problems. program development. and land acquisition face the urban metropolitan region and the small communities. Every type of recreation service in every setting needs a central agency which can gather and disseminate information.

We are driving out our small farmers about as fast as possible and bemoaning our unemployment. Surely the statistics down in the Department of Agriculture must show that the large and flexible farm operations have continued to hold their own. but the smaller and possibly more inefficient operations face steadily declining incomes. Under all of our socalled farm programs. either the consumer or the taxpayer has to pay the bill and it has grown to be no small item. I do not know whether it is fair to say that a marginal farmer would probably be marginal in other pursuits as well. but I do know that he has been largely overlooked in most of the farm programs. The surpluses can be eliminated only if some of the big producers are induced to alter their habits. I am advised that Congress is soon to vote upon a doityourself scheme which. in my opinion. is strictly old hat. How about the existing milk orders which were set up on that basis. to be altered only upon the vote of the producing farmers? The Department tolerated group voting. which meant that the individual had no vote at all. Disparity in producer payments and technicalities by the dozen crept in. but certainly not through any effort on the part of the farmers.

March 8. 1961. \"Russian Colonialism and the Necessity of a Special Captive Nations Committee.\" pages 32863311. The popular response to House Resolution 211 has been so enthusiastic and impressive that I feel dutybound to disclose the thoughts and feelings of many Americans who have taken the time to write me on this subject. These citizens are cognizant of the basic reasons underlying the necessity of the proposed committee. They understand clearly the vital contribution that such a committee could make to our national security interests. In many cases. they know that no public or private body is in existence today which is devoted to the task of studying continuously. systematically. and objectively all of the captive nations. those in Eastern Europe and Asia. including the numerous captive nations in the Soviet Union itself. Because their thoughts and sentiments are expressive and valuable. I include the following responses of our citizens to House Resolution 211 in the Appendix of the RECORD:",

California is experiencing its third dry year in succession and this is its driest year in the last quarter century. In the most populous counties no drier year has been recorded since statehood. 111 years ago. Grim disaster is being averted in California this summer and fall only by the existence of two great reclamation projects built by the Federal government. and the related aqueducts and local projects built by agencies in California. I refer to the Boulder Canyon project on the Colorado River which regulates that stream and supplies water to much of southern California and to the Central Valley project which serves the great Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. My State this year would have become a major disaster area without these projects. This is recognized in California where. under the leadership of Gov. Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown. new ground is being broken in FederalState cooperation in water resources development. The voters of California last year approved the mammoth California State water project which will transfer excess water from the Feather River south as far as the Mexican border through a great system of reservoirs and aqueducts. The job is being undertaken -by the California Department of Water Resources headed by William E. Warne as director. Many of you will remember Bill Warne as a former Reclamation official and Assistant Secretary of the Interior. Mr. Warne has written an article. now appearing in certain California newspapers. which emphasizes the value of the Central Valley project to the new State water plan. It is an expression of the cooperation and coordination I have noted. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.",

Moreover. it is not just a question of education for deaf children but of providing stimulating and rewarding education for the adult deaf. The enactment of this bill can definitely contribute to the vocational skills of the deaf. Mr. President. I believe the program outlined in this bill is a sound one which presents a well thought out approach to improving educational and vocational opportunities for deaf children and adults. In addition to providing for the production of films the bill very wisely includes provisions for research in the use of captioned films as educational media with the deaf and for training professional personnel in the proper use of captioned films. When I first looked into this whole question I was surprised to note that very little research and training has been done in these fields. The provisions for research and training of personnel will insure that the maximum effective use is made of these films. Mr. President. the proper education of the deaf is a national challenge which deserves our serious attention. The outstanding chairman of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. Senator. HILL. and other distinguished Senators have consistently sponsored and supported legislation. to assist the deaf. In this connection. I believe that Senator Musixms and my bill makes an important contribution. It is clearly important that we provide our deaf children with the best possible learning tools and that. we help to stimulate adult education programs for the deaf which will in turn enable them to enhance their contribution to our society.",

Now we know that greater injury is being done to them by their own government and that each passing day aggravates their problem. If this measure becomes law. and it should. it will help to bring the Castro government to bay. To a surprising degree. Cubas economy still is supported from the United States. This support should be stopped completely. The Cuban economy already is pinched from Castros blunders. His movement is losing its glamour throughout the hemisphere. We should be doubly careful that no action of ours helps to keep it alive. When we trade with Cuba we are helping to keep the Castro government in power. This Is one step and one step only. Very probably much more will be required to rescue the Cuban people from communism. I trust that the necessary action to put those other steps in motion are now under serious preparation by our Government. Whatever is required should be done. and there should not be undue delay.

Mr. Chairman. starting with the Hoover Commission recommendations. the Congress has adopted a number of reorganization plans. As I understood it. the reorganization plans were designated to bring about more efficient administration of Government in the various agencies and departments at less cost and with fewer employees. I am sure that under the reorganization plans that have been adopted there have been some good results. but in connection with some I am sure the reverse has been true. Last year Congress approved Reorganization Plan No. 7 which created an independent agency called the Maritime Commission. Reading the report and the bill I find that the Maritime Commission has requested an additional 153 employees over what the committee has approved for the Commission. This is just another illustration of what often happens under reorganization plans: Instead of spending less money. instead of employing fewer people we are going to spend more money than ever before. at least in this instance. I was one of those who opposed Reorganization Plan No. 7. and I am not taking this time just to say \"I told you so.\" I just want some assurance from the committee with respect to the Maritime Commission. I say if we have adopted the reorganization plan let us make the plan work. I have considerable confidence in this subcommittee. I have worked with it with respect to maritime matters over the years.

We cut down 50 percent of the increased personnel because we felt that gave them all the personnel they could use to do a good job this coming year out of these funds. and we feel the amount is sufflcient to do the job. We have found as the gentleman said about these reorganization plans. Our experience has been that whefn you start a new agency like this unless you hold them in line the chances are they will get out of balance and employ more personnel and spend more money than they should.

This historic opinion is of fundamental importance to international law and to the present and future capacity of the United Nations to maintain peace. The U.S. Government consistently has been of the view that the assessments in question are expenses of the organization within the meaning of the United Nations Charter and thus binding upon the members. The Legal Adviser of the Department of State so argued before the International Court of Justice during its consideration of this issue. The Courts opinion will strengthen the efforts of the Secretary General to collect arrearages on assessments to finance the United Nations peacekeeping missions in the Congo and Middle East. Some members have not paid these assessments. claiming that they were not legally binding. In view of the Courts opinion this claim is plainly not tenable. Collection of outstanding arrearages on these two accounts would help the United States to pay accumulated bills for these two missions through the period ending June 30 of this year. Financing the Congo and Middle East operations beyond June 30. however. depends upon the success of the United Nations proposal to borrow $200 million. No assessments have been voted for these operations after June 30. Expenses for the Congo and Middle East missions are now running at approximately $11.5 million per month. 44 nations have purchased or pledged $72.4 million toward the $200 million so far. The U.S. Senate has passed a bill authorizing the President to lend up to $100 million to the U.N. and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs is currently holding hearings on this legislation.

That is what has been wasted in the past by the purchase of just one radar set. but I am elated to report today that the taxpayers have won a victory in this case and will soon see some money saved. June 12. 1962. I detailed eight cases of military procurement waste for the House and the Armed Services Committee. Case No. 5 was a report on purchase of a radar set known as the APS88. It was purchased in the past by sole source or negotiated bid and my study showed these tactics overcharged the taxpayer by over a half million dollars. It also appealed that a new planned procurement. in which only two firms were asked to bid. was going to result in a higher price for the equipment. I promised to study the new action closely. Yesterday. Comptroller General Joseph Campbell advised me that the Navy has now delayed this procurement and will probably buy at least part of the set through open. competitive bidding. The Navy is going to open the door. Regardless of how it rationalizes this action. here is what happened. When bids were opened. they were. indeed. higher and the Navy had to get off the spot. It will do so shortly by buying the set competitively. The how and why of this are not really as important as the fact that much money will now be saved. Just how much will be saved will be known when a contract is let and I shall follow this procurement closely until that time. Yesterday. the taxpayers lost a battle when the Navy awarded a contract for production of the PRC41 radio set on a sole source basis. The taxpayers pockets were picked and the Navy said. in effect. \"Damn the dollars. full speed ahead.\" even though a subcommittee of the House said the radio could have been bought by competitive bidding. Good news about the APS88 is the important thing today. The APS88. the arrests last week in New Jersey and the progress of the amendment which will do away with much sole source buying by the military are all evidences of progress. If American industry gets a fair chance. the taxpayers will get a break. and that is what I am fighting for.",

Inasmuch as Washington State is the site of 15 papermills and is No. 2 producer of woodpulp among the 50 States. this is worth comment. The statement of policy. made public late last week at the 85th annual convention of the industry in Manhattan. is. of course. no airy giveaway of the industry or its markets. But it does recognize the reality of the European Common Market and the resulting new necessities of commercefrom the point of view of what has become a global industry. Tjhe United States imports annually about a billion dollars worth of pulp and paper commodities. and exports about onehalf billion dollars worth. The statement of policy suggests no blank check for the President. but does urge Congress to give him power \"to negotiate with the Common Market upon a basis\" which would assure pulp and paper \"a mutual reduction of tariffs\" and would \"arrive at identical tariffs. item for item.\" It urges realism for itself. yet also faces the realism posed by the European impulse toward the Common Market and the necessity of competing within that market. At least it is of interest as the first forthright public expression on the subject. in detail. from a leading industry in this country.

Mr. Speaker. if we could only exercise the same kind of wisdom in the United States. we could easily. painlessly. and voluntarily raise over $10 billion a year in additional income which would be used to cut taxes and reduce our gigantic national debt.

The editorial follows: WE NEED Moax This State has taken a magnificent step toward curbing delinquency by opening a rehabilitation camp for troubled youngsters in a Catskill Mountain forest near Renssellaerville. This pioneering project is designed to guide boys 15 through 17 in the right direction before they become hardened delinquents. Here 60 teenagers whom the courts hold to be on the threshold of delinquency will continue their schooling and receive vocational training while working In healthful surroundings. This is exactly what this newspaper has been advocating since 1956. We congratulate Governor Rockefeller and the State division for youth on this realistic approach to the whole problem of youth crime. But a camp with a capacity of 60 boys Is only a beginning. We must have more such campsand soon. We also point out to the Governor that such health camps are the most effective means of providing adequate aftercare for dope addicts who have undergone hospital treatment. Here the addict trying to fight his way back could be quarantined away from the surroundings that led to his addiction. State Senator Frank J. Pino and Assemblymhn Stanley Steingut are sponsoring legislation providing for such camps. We believe the Governor should make this a companion measure to the highly commendable MetcalfVolker bill to provide hospital facilities for addicts which was passed overwhelmingly by the assembly and now awaits approval in the State senate.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. St. Patrick. the patron saint and the apostle of Ireland. is one of the most celebrated and revered church fathers in Christendom. and his birthday. St. Patricks Day. is the Irish national holiday. His exact birthplace in Britain. called Bannanuenta. has not been definitely identified. and even the year of his birth is not certain. but it is said to fall between 385 and 389. He was brought up as a shepherd. and when he was 16 years old. he was set upon by a band of Irish bandits who had been making a raid on King Niall. They took him and his sheep to Connaught and kept him there in captivity for 6 years. Then he made his escape on a ship used for exporting fierce Irish wolfhounds. He landed on the coast of Gaul-(France)-and eventually made his way to the monastery Of Lerins. where for several years he studied the principles of Christianity. While there he saw in a dream a man named Victorious. bearing many epistles in his hands. On one of these St. Patrick read the words \"The Voice of the Irish.\" and imagined he heard his people say: \"We pray thee. holy youth. come and walk among us as before.\" This vision inspired him to return to Ireland as a missionary. After preparing for his mission he returned to Ireland to teach his people the njw religion. At first the Irish were ready to stone him for attempting an innovation in the religion of their ancestors. He obtained a hearing. however. and to explain his point he picked a shamrock from the roadside. using the three leaves on one stem to illustrate the principle of the Trinity. This simple comparison so greatly impressed his hearers that they allowed themselves to be baptized there and then. That was the glorious beginning of Christianity in Ireland. During his long ministry he founded many churches. among them the church and monastery of Armagh. where he spent the latter part of his life and where he died at the age of 72. The Irish. being at heart a deeply religious people. always remember St. Patrick and celebrate St. Patricks Day with particular enthusiasm and joy.

In 1954. former Senator Clements and I submitted a resolution asking for a survey of the Kentucky River Valley Basin and all its tributaries. I believe the records of the Corps of Engineers show that for more than 100 years the Kentucky River Valley extending from Virginia to the Ohio River has been swept and ravaged by floods. After the tragic flooding of the Kentucky in 1957. I introduced a resolution in the Public Works Committee. asking that the Corps of Engineers expedite its survey. and this was done. In 1960. the Corps of Engineers. after years of intensive work presented its plan for the comprehensive flood protection of the Kentucky River Valley. The plan called for the construction of four reservoirsBooneville. Carrs Fork. Eagle Creek. and Red Riverand local protection at Frankfort. the capital of Kentucky. which is flooded almost every year.

    "speech": "I thank the Senator. I believe the facts to be that Mr. Thomas J. Watson. Jr.. has received options representing compensation of more than $4 million since 1956 through the restricted stock option device. on which he has completely avoided payment of all normal income tax. This income. which Mr. Watson seems clearly to acknowledge as compensation for his services from the company of which he is an officer. is not taxed at the time the option is exercised. at which time a real and measurable profit is realized. The tax accrues only if and at such time as the stock is sold. and then only at the low. capital gains rate of 25 percent. Should Mr. Watson choose to retain the optioned stock in his estate. as I pointed out to the Senate earlier this week. then no income tax whatsoever. or even any capital gains tax whatsoever. will ever be paid by anyone on this tremendous fortune. And all this is technically legal. Yet. some uninformed people say that it is impossible to become a millionaire with present tax laws. How wrong they are. There are many beaten paths to virtually overnight multimilliondollar fortunes for the insiders of our large corporations. The restricted stock option route is certainly one of these wellbeaten paths. A restricted stock option requires neither capital nor risk. nor taxes. it is a free ride. Now. according to the press. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller approved all this. not only as a matter of Federal law. but noted. perhaps with pride. that he had successfully supported a bill in the New York State Legislature to grant additional tax advantages to holders of stock options. Perhaps I will be pardoned for wondering as to just what more tax advantage than those I have already described Governor Rockefeller would think the holders of stock options should be entitled. What measure of social justice do you find. Governor Rockefeller. in the complete avoidance of normal income tax on a large portion of his income by the president of a corporation. while such taxes are withheld from the weekly paychecks of other workers and most American citizens? Or. do you consider this sectionalism for me to raise such questions. Governor Rockefeller. as you seemed to indicate by your reference to me as \"a certain southern Senator?\"",

It is interesting to observe that some of the officials of the corporations which have been convicted for conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Government through price rigging were holders of restricted stock options. I shall make an additional speech. after some further inquiry. into the kind of incentive that a restricted option gives. I have approached this subject primarily from the standpoint of equity and fairness in tax law. I am not certain that the type of incentive which is being provided to corporate executives does not go even more importantly to the heart of our free enterprise system. At least. I wish to examine that phase of the problem further. Around 1900. a large percentage of the top managers of corporations were owners of a substantial interest in the corporations. Today this is not the case. Our large corporations are managed by a group of professional managers who are not effectively accountable to anyone. least of all to their own stockholders. As I have said. these highly compensated executives are not satisfied with what they have. They want ever more and more. and at a reduced tax rate. The restricted stock option fits in beautifully. Now. the stockholders and the general public might be willing. up to a point. to overlook a small amount of stock option manipulation by insiders. But these men are not willing to stop at any reasonable point. They want more and more. Companies are now starting on their second or third round of options. Top management wants to become even more highly compensated at even lower tax rates. The stockholders of this country are beginning to wake up to the dangers of the stock option racket. I have had letters and telegrams from all over the country encouraging me to keep up the fight against this abuse. But stockholders are as yet unable to protect themselves from management. It is up to the Congress to act to protect the stockholders and the public.",

To do this may well require more taxes. for we must spend more in the areas where the Soviets are ahead or are moving up. In Mr. Watsons testimony there are other statements of which I wholeheartedly approve. The point I was making was that since 1956 he has received restricted stock options representing an income of more than $4 million. on which all normal income tax. under the law. is avoided. and on which all capital gains tax may be avoided by him. I have raised the question. not because Mr. Watson has been immoral. not because Mr. Watson has operated illegally. not because he is a bad character in any way. but because he typifies the incorrectness. the wrongness. of the policy of the Government by which we lay the heavy hand of income taxes on every man who makes $40 a week. and then allow presidents of corporations to get an income of millions. on which normal income taxes are completely avoided.

Count Casimir Pulaski. a nobleman and army officer driven into exile. joined the American Revolutionary Army as an officer in 1777. He commanded a unit known as Pulaskis Legion. and was made a brigadier general and chief of cavalry in our U.S. Army. He died a heros death leading a cavalry charge at the siege of Savannah on October 11. 1779. Mr. President. I am proud to say that in my home State of Rhode Island in commemoration of this great Polish American. there Is a Casimir Pulaski Memorial Forest of approximately 3.000 acres within which is the 100acre Casimir Pulaski State Park. In the city of Providence. the hub of my State. in Roger Williams Park. there is a Casimir Pulaski statue. And. in Central Falls. where many Rhode Islanders of proud Polish ancestry live. there is a square and hall named after this most prominent American of Polish birth. It is Important that on this day we remember the great link of friendship that has existed for centuries between Poland and America. I myself have visited that great country several times both before World War II and since. On one occasion I recall joining the students participating in the Technical School uprising against the Communists that occurred in 1957. and. on the last. I toured the new Oder Neisse Territories now inhabited almost entirely by Poles. where 2 /2 million Poles have been born and an area which I believe should be recognized as an integral part of Poland. Mr. President. let us hope that Poland will spawn more Pulaskis in order to help restore democracy to that country. just as the original Pulaski helped bring democracy to our own country.",

There is an element in the present controversy that is of deep concern to the Senator from Iowa. and which he thinks may be at the root of some of the problems as far as the House Membership is concerned. What I have to say is not applicable to the distinguished Senator from Virginia. but there is a feeling on the part of a good many Members of the House that there is too much of a tendency on the Senate side to increase appropriations. I invite the attention of Senators to what happened during the previous session with respect to the HEW appropriation bill. The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. BusH] offered an amendment that would have cut back appropriations which had been increased by the Senate Appropriations Committee to what the President of the United States had requested. The amendment failed. But that amendment indicated that the Senate Appropriations Committee had increased the House figures for appropriations above and beyond what the President himself had requested. Then. acting in accordance with the Appropriations Committees wishes. the Senate decided to leave the appropriation as reported. I believe that the problem would be greatly relieved if there were not so great a tendency on the part of the Senate Appropriations Committee to increase the appropriations approved by the House. That question is of great and immediate concern to the American people today. The senior colleague of the Senator from Virginia has been preaching on the floor of the Senate for the past 2 weeks against the increasing expenditures by the Federal Government. He has pointed out that there cannot be meaningful tax cuts until those unnecessary or increasing expenditures are cut back to make possible meaningful tax cuts. That factor may be at the root of some of the concern on the part of the House. While as a Member of the Senate I would certainly like to support my own Appropriations Committee. I must say that I am distressedand I know that my concern is shared by many othersover the tendency of the Senate Committee on Appropriations to increase expenditures once the House has acted.",

I wonder if you could tell us why you regard the restrictions on our aid to Yugoslavia. that Congress has imposed. as a demonstration of. to use your words again. appalling ignorance? He asked for documentation. In the course of this discussion. Mr. Kennan gave only two examples. He said: Ive met many people whove thought that we were still continuing to give these people military aid. who dont know that no military aid has flowed to Yugoslavia since 1957 or 1958. His second point was: I find many people who dont know that the Yugoslav internal system differs from that of the Soviet Union. who dont know that the Yugoslavs apply an entirely different system of relations with foreign countries. including with ourselves. than do the countries of the Soviet bloc. I am convinced that the Senator from Connecticut and I recognize this.

The impression I have of this ignorance comes from other trips that I have made back to this country during the period since Ive been Ambassador there. and Ive encountered one person after another in the public. in the press. on the Hill. who dont understand lots of very important things about Yugoslavia. Ive met many people whove thought that we were still continuing to give these people military aid. who dont know that no military aid has flowed to Yugoslavia since 1957 or 1958. I recently read a report of a congressional committee which expressed doubt as to whether Yugoslavia was really Independent of the Soviet bloc. I dont know a single competent foreign observer in Belgrade or anyone whos been there in that capacity over the past decade who doubts that Yugoslavia is independent of the Soviet bloc. I find many people who dont know that the Yugoslav internal system differs from that of the Soviet Union. who dont know that the Yugoslavs apply an entirely different system of relations with foreign countries. including ourselves. than do the countries of the Soviet bloc. We have a very sizable major informational effort going in Yugoslavia. We operate public reading rooms there for American literature.",

The bill I introduced in the Senate last week in behalf of myself and my colleague from Minnesota embodied the very principles which were built into the feed grain storage measure. and into the amendment which the Senate adopted yesterday. namely. to provide allotments and controls to enable the farmer to get better prices for his commodities. If one does not accept allotments and controls under the referendum. he will have to accept a drop in base support each yearfrom 75 to 70 percent. from 70 to 65 percent. from 65 to 60 percent. and so onfor a 5year period. In other words. adjustments would be made in terms of lower costs to the Government for shorter supplies. That is a rather farreaching proposal. But I have come to the conclusion that that proposal would be better handled by taking it before the committee in the regular order of legislative procedure. However. the point is made that so far as the principle of the bill is concernedthe principle in the HumphreyMcCarthy proposal introduced last weekit is one of a flexible type of price support schedules with allotments and a base period. If one does not accept the referendum allotment in the base period. and the plan of penalty payments for overproduction and incentive payments for cooperation. the price support levels will drop 5 percent each year for 5 years. That is tough legislation. it is farreaching legislation. I had not intended to offer it today. but unless we can obtain some relief from an incredibly difficult economic problem. possibly we shall have to revise our calculations and consider whether to offer the proposal.",

As the program now operates. the Commodity Credit Corporation can be expected to purchase about 10 percent of this amount. or 10.000 pounds. in a single marketing year. With a support price of $3.11. it costs the Commodity Credit Corporation about $4.15 for each 100 pounds to purchase this surplus. plus handling and storage costs. Under my amendment. the producer might agree to reduce his production by 10 percent and become eligible for payments. For reducing production he could receive payments up to $2.50 a hundred pounds. or a payment of $250 if he reduced his production by 10.000 pounds. This would keep his net income at exactly what it was if he were producing 10.000 more pounds of milk. In addition. there would be $165the difference between $415 and $250which could be used to increase his income on the milk he produced. That would be $165 with which to work on the income side of the production of the particular farmer. The $415 cost under the present program. if all of it were paid to the farmer on 90 percent of his production. instead of being used to buy butter and place it in storage. would actually increase his return to $3.57 a hundred poundsan increase from $3.11. This would increase his net income. if he complied to the full extent. from $150 to $200 above that which he gets at the present time. If he produced it all and got $3.11. he would receive about $3.110 in income for the year. If he participated fully in this program. the $250 paid to him for cutting down production and the other $165 by way of supplemental payments. the income on milk alone would be $3.213. or something more than a $100 increase. If we take into consideration the reduction in feed costs and the cost of handling. his income would be increased from $150 to $200 a year. as a result of this program. with no increase whatsoever to the Government. I think this example. applied to a very small producer. is an indication of how. depending upon compliance. the proposal would affect the total dairy industry. and how the Government program would be benefited.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. throughout my years in public life one of the most distressing problems with which I have been involved is the tragic and unnecessary story of drinking teenagers and the death. destruction and disfigurement which has resulted. On previous occasions. I have brought this matter to the attention of our colleagues and pointed out the great harm which is being done to the young people and the law enforcement activities of New Jersey. Pennsylvania. Connecticut. Massachusetts. Vermont. and Canada by the refusal of New York State to raise its drinking age from 18 to 21 in conformity with all its neighbors. Neither morally nor realistically can this situation be dismissed as being New Yorks responsibility alone. So long as New York provides a drinking haven for the youngsters of other States. then those States have a legitimate complaint. Their own residents are being encouraged to break the law. Their law enforcement agencies are being handicapped in carrying out their obligations. Highway deaths directly resulting from teenagers returning from drinking sessions in New York are increasing. The Governors of Vermont. Connecticut. and New Jersey have been outspoken in their criticism of New Yorks 18yearold drinking law. Because of its interstate implications. Mr. Speaker. I believe our colleagues should be aware of this difficult situation. and I propose to continue to inform the Congress of the need for corrective action. Under leave to extend my remarks in the RECORD. I include an editorial which appeared in the March 6 issue of the Daily Journal of Elizabeth. N.J.. and an editorial from the Utica (N.Y.)

In the 3 years since Smith Kline & French Laboratories originated its program. 92 American medical students have received Smith Kline & French fellowships under which senior medical students visit remote areas of the world for a minimum of 10 weeks of work and study. They learn how medicine is practiced in cultures greatly different from our -own. they study diseases not common in the United States. and they gain firsthand experience as to the acute need for medical knowledge in distant lands. In addition. they serve as informal goodwill ambassadors for the United States. The fellowships are. of course. confined to the medical field. for Smith Kline & French Laboratories believe that medicine in all its aspects presents one of the best possible avenues toward increased understanding among nations.

In this spirit. last week I introduced a bill. H.R. 10706. to bring about some much needed improvements in the Civil Service Retirement Act. Basically. the bill would provide: An automatic costofliving increase for retired Federal employees each year. if the increase exceeds 1 percent. a corresponding Increase in the annuities of retired civil servants when currently employed Government workers get a pay raise. stabilization of civil service retirement with social security benefits. I believe these changes are vital to the strengthening of the current Civil Service Act. In this rapidly changing world of ours. the value of the dollar has not remained constant. Accordingly. those who depend upon fixed annuities for their income suffer when the value of the dollar decreases. Without these changes. I feel we are penalizing. rather than rewarding. a Federal employee at his retirement for his long service to his country.

I am certain that our taxpayers must have been greatly disturbed when our Budget Director recently estimated that \"within a few years\" our budget will be $100 billion. They should have been stunned when another alarming prediction indicated that by 1965 our Federal spending could very well rise to $125 billion a year. Mr. Speaker. our heavily burdened taxpayers are entitled to know exactly where they stand. They are entitled to know what they can expect for the future. As for the President. he has already said a tax cut in the next few years depends on continued prosperity. None of us. Mr. Speaker. has to be a fiscal expert to know that more spending will mean higher taxes and Increased debts. In the last year. our national debt has risen to over $298 billion which figures out to $17.700 every minute. $25.888.000 every day and about $9.4 billion a year in interest charges alone. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. we can tell our taxpayers to forget whatever hopes or dreams they had about tax relief. We can tell them that the future looks dismal unless. yes. unless this Congress has the guts to face the fiscal facts of life. unless we have the Intestinal fortitude to tax a lucrative industry which can produce more than $10 billion a year in additional revenue. The American gambling spirit in this country has made this business a $50 billion a year industry which remains untapped. We can easily. through a national lottery. tap this new source of revenue and pump into our Treasury more than $10 billion a year in additional income. Mr. Speaker. as far as our taxpayers are concerned. only through a national lottery can they find an avenue of relief. Only through a national lottery can we raise. voluntarily and painlessly. enough money to provide Mr. and Mrs. American taxpayer with a tax cut and start to reduce our gigantic national debt.",

The purpose of S. 2533 is to permit wheat farmers in the summer fallow wheat area who also produce feed grains to participate in both the wheat and the feed grain reduction program for 1962 on an equitable basis. In areas where wheat is planted on a summer fallow rotation. land had already been fallowed in preparation for seeding wheat before the enactment of the 1962 wheat program. which requires a reduction of 10 per cent in wheat acreage. Unless the land which has been fallowed this year is seeded to a cover crop this fall. it is subject to serious wind erosion. In much of this summer fallow area. farmers also produce feed grains. chiefly grain sorghums. which are planted in the spring. The bill will permit a farmer who produces both wheat and grain sorghum and who wants to participate both in the wheat reduction and the feed grain reduction programs -for 1962 to plant his acreage which has been prepared for wheat but cannot be planted to wheat this fall in barley and to count that as part of his feed grain planting for 1962. in lieu of the feed grain which would normally be planted next spring.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on Sunday. September 17. the Prince Edward School Foundation dedicated the Prince Edward Academy. This represents a great milestone in the fight of the white people of Prince Edward County to preserve liberty. freedom. and constitutional government in America. They have been waging this fight over many years in spite of many obstacles and. ofttimes. almost alone. I commend them for their determination to preserve for themselves the right to choose their associates and to educate their children as they deem best. They have made a gallant fight and in my opinion. victory is theirs. They have been successful because they were willing to sacrifice. to work hard. and to follow in the footsteps of our Founding Fathers who were willing to sacrifice for the things they knew to be right and in which they believed. I am fearful that the majority of the people of Virginia fail to realize the importance of the efforts that have been expended by the white people of Prince Edward County nor do they realize the opposition and obstacles that they have faced and finally overcome. I commend these people. I stand shoulder to shoulder with them. I attended the exercises Sunday and heard the wonderful address of the Honorable T. Coleman Andrews. of Richmond. Va.. when he expounded high principles and concepts of constitutional government. individual freedom. and liberty. Mr. Andrews is a noble Virginian and an outstanding American. I commend him for the great work he is doing in trying to bring home to the American people the evils of socialistic government and the necessity of maintaining constitutional government in America if we are to preserve our heritage as well as our liberties and freedoms. Under leave to extend my remarks. I include herewith the splendid address of the Honorable T. Coleman Andrews. which he delivered at the dedicatioti exercises of the Prince Edward Academy this past Sunday. September 17. 1961:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Mr. Edward J. Mowery is currently writing a series of articles on the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. These articles are appearing in a number of newspapers throughout the country. Since the Committee on UnAmerican Activities is under constant attack from the Communists and extreme leftwing. it is my feeling that the Members of Congress should have the benefit of Edward Mowerys findings. Mr. Speaker. first we should know something about the author of these articles. Pulitzer Prizewinner Edward J. Mowery is no novice in the field of civil liberties. He has been described by Time as a specialist in the \"Story Behind the News.\" In the midforties. his documented series on the false conviction of a Wall Street broker became a nationwide sensation. winning redress and vindication for the accused. In the fifties. the writers articles concerning a man facing a third trial for murder are largely credited with achieving the defendants acquittal. And in 1953. after a 7year fight to prove the innocence of another person selving a life term for murder. Mr. Mowery watched Louis Hoffner walk out of a courtrooma free man. This crusade brought the writer the Pulitzer Prize and created a new category in the annual awards. A7528 Mowerys expos6 of the teenage drug menace led to scores of new laws in the Nation which tightened controls on the illicit narcotics traffic. His defense of the FBI against Communist harassment became a U.S. Senate document. Among his 14 awards and citations. including honors from three universities. are the American Legions Four Chaplains Interfaith Gold Medal and the New York Criminal and Civil Courts Bar Association citation.",

They. on so many occasions. sponsor or participate in significant community and civic projects. By so doing. they become even more a motivating force for good citizenship. During the past year the Jersey Journal. published in Jersey City. N.J.. sponsored several important and very worthwhile activities. These have generally been in the field of education and included such things as Hudson County. N.J.. first science fair in which schoolchildren of all grades participated. A countywide spelling bee has been sponsored by this paper for the last 6 years. These projects are undertaken in an effort to \"create a greater interest among youth in the written word. the history of our country. and the frontiers of science.\" Particularly significant and timely was an essay contest sponsored this year by the Jersey Journal for high school students of Hudson County. So impressed were the editors of that newspaper with the inspiring message delivered by President Kennedy on the occasion of his inaugural that they proposed and sponsored this contest. with the purpose of keeping alive in the minds of the young citizens of that county and giving greater emphasis to the thoughts so splendidly expressed in that message. These endeavors to spark ever increasing interest in good citizenship. government and history. to assure a greater understanding by our students of the problems of the Nation and of the world and the role we must play as a nation and as citizens. are. in my opinion outstanding contributions above and beyond the primary responsibility of a newspaper in a community. These programs designed to stimulate the thinking and encourage the students in the schools in Hudson County evidence the personal interest of the editor of the Jersey Journal. Mr. Eugene Farrell. in the youth of the communities which his paper serves. I respectfully request that the text of the essay contest winner. Justin Camerlengo. be printed as part of my remarks as it appeared in the Jersey Journal newspaper:",

Let us appraise it and assess It as best we can. If the program merits extension. that will be an easy thing to do.

If we vote for a 3year extension. we will lose the first year. anyway. because it will be necessary to accommodate ourselves to the new setup.

Now they seek to cut its throat. by limiting it to 3 years. If Senators will examine the bill. they will find that there are more provisions in it for negotiation than in any bill previously passed by the Congress. There are pages setting forth requirements concerning negotiations. advice from departments. and public hearings. It could not take less than a year to place the administration in a posture of beginning the negotiations. We do not know when the Common Market identity will be known. when the various members joining the Common Market will be identified and made a part of it. If Senators do not trust the administration. they should not pass the bill. The Senate is considering a bill to give to the administration authority to cut the remaining tariffs by 50 percent. Would Senators not rather provide for 5 years to do this. if the Executive is to use the authority? Would Senators not prefer to have that done in 5 years. instead of 3 or 2? It will require a year for the administration to begin negotiating. and a year to complete the negotiations. following which they could implement them within a 3year period under the 5year program. Instead of having a longer period of time and more years in which to permit the new rates to phase in. would Senators wish to require that it be done in 1 year. or 2?

Congress has a duty to state clearly that domestic industries which are disadvantaged in international competition by governmental policies which directly raise their costs of production deserve the maximum safeguards compatible with the broad purposes of trade expansion. Furthermore. there are certain industriesespecially in the agricultural fieldwhich are not susceptible to real immediate help from a program of adjustment assistance. In order to meet these special problems in the broadest and most flexible way. and without seriously diminishing the Presidents trade negotiation authority. I have offered. together with the Senators from New York . an amendment intended to reserve from trade negotiations such items as are produced by industries which meet the conditions stated above. Also. a review procedure by the Tariff Commission would be provided for. and the President would have the additional choice of entering into international commodity agreements on these items. In effect. any domestically produced item. for which the chief cost of processing derives from an agricultural product which is under a domestic price support program which causes the domestic price of the agricultural product to be at least 10 percent higher than the world market price. would be reserved from negotiations. This reservation. of course. would be subject to review by the Tariff Commission and would cease to be in effect once an international commodity agreement is entered into. Further. an article referred to in Agricultural Handbook No. 143. of which the United States exports 5 percent or less of annual production. and the U.S. production and sales of which are not a substantial factor in determining the world market price. would also be reserved from negotiations. Again this reservation would be subject to review by the Tariff Commission and would cease to be in effect once an international commodity agreement was entered into.

Our farmers provided the arsenals of food in World War II. They produced the food that forestalled starvation in the battletorn world in the postwar era. I believe that Americas farms saved Europe from communism. I believe that the abundance of food and fiber from these broad lands of ours should used in the cause of freedom. in the crucial struggle for world peace. America has made food for peace a reality around the world. This is a great humanitarian program. It is a symbol of the spirit of brotherhood in the free world. This program is ably directed by our former colleague in the House. Hon. George McGovern. Mr. McGovern recently called my attention to a penetrating and forceful article on the place of food in the struggle for peace. written by Mr. Grant Cannon. editor of the Farm Quarterly. and appearing in the fall 1961 issue of that publication. It occurs to me that what Mr. Cannon has to say deserves broad attention. Therefore. with the permission of the House. I am inserting the article in the Appendix of the RECORD.",

As has been stated. we had been advised that he was recuperating from a recent operation. and it was our hope and expectation that he would rejoin us here on the floor this week. OVERTON BROOKS possessed in full measure those personal qualities of honor. integrity. and patriotism. of which our colleagues have heretofore spoken. He was a leader and a statesman and his work in establishing our Armed Forces Reserve and the Committee on Science and Astronautics on a sound basis is well known to everyone. However. I would like to address my brief comments at this time to another quality. that of conscientious devotion to duty. OVERTON BROOKS spent all his working life in taking care of the needs of his district. his committee. and the Nation. He literally worked about a 20hour day. 7 days a week. He was a man of temperate habits who diligently deCompany A7371 Percent voted attention to the best interests of the Nation.

It appears that Secretary of Agriculture Freeman has the answer. One mighty reasonably ask why are actions such as the one just instituted of such importance. An examination of the statutes discloses the fact that in providing for the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act. it was clearly specified that the Federal Trade Commission shall have no power or jurisdiction relating to any matter which by that law was made subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture except when he should request the Federal Trade Commission that it make investigations7 U.S.C. 227.

President Kennedy said on this subject \"since education is a matter of national concern. the Federal Government should assist in expediting the use of television as a tested aid to education in the schools and colleges of the Nation. and as a means of meeting the needs of adult educators.\" The bill at least accelerates the establishment of additional educational television stations by assisting the several States in the development of State programs for the construction of educational television broadcasting facilities. and by aiding government and private nonprofit agencies concerned with educational television through Federal matching grants in the construction of educational television broadcasting facilities.",

I want to compliment the members of the committee. and particularly the members of the subcommittee for reporting this legislation. and to thank them for coming to the city and county of Denver more than 3 years ago to inspect the educational television station that has been operated by school district No. 1. in the city and county of Denver. The experience resulting from the operation by the school district shows the need of educational television. I am hopeful that when this legislation is adopted it can be extended and used not only in the city and county of Denver. but also throughout the State of Colorado.

My interest in the development of educational television extends back to 1949 when as a New York State senator I sponsored the first legislation for support of State educational television in New York State. New York State has been a leader in the field of educational television. In New York City we have the National Educational Television and Radio Center and through its efforts the Metropolitan New York area has obtained Channel 13 which will provide fullscale educational television service for our great metropolitan area. Our New York experience. however. highlights the need for Federal and State assistance to communities in the establishment of educational television. Mr. Speaker. it is obvious that television has the capability to expand a massive upgrading in the quality of American education for a cost which we can easily afford. a cost in fact which we cannot afford not to pay.

I hope and believe the great majority of the Members here. if not all. will promptly approve this measureH.R. 132before us. which provides for the establishment of a program of Federal matching grants for the construction of television facilities to be used for educational purposes. It clearly appears. from the testimony revealed. that some 200 of the Nations television channels reserved for educational use have not been activated primarily because of a lack of funds for construction of television transmission facilities. At this time. particularly. when education in this country faces serious challenges. when the need is imperative for additional physical facilities and teachers for proper instruction of the increasing numbers of students. when subjects must be taught which only relatively few instructors are qualified and prepared to teach adequately. it seems unthinkable that this great promising medium of instruction through television should not be fully utilized as a modern and progressive teaching instrument. We have. further. the authoritative convictions of the most highly regarded experts in this field that instruction by educational television promises to be greatly superior to conventional methods of classroom teaching in a number of subjects. particularly in science studies involving technical demonstrations for better understanding. This bill is modeled after the HillBurton Act which has proven so successful in stimulating. with the aid of Federal matching grants. the construction of hospital facilities throughout the country. This projection of instruction through television is completely in line with the recommendations of the President on this subject and there can be no doubt whatsoever that the expanded educational and cultural development objectives inherent in this legislative proposal would be in the national interest. I most earnestly urge the adoption of this measure.",

This bill. as it came to the floor. was a worthwhile measure and I thoroughly supported its system of matching Federal grants for the construction of television facilities to be used for educational purposes. In the original version. under section 393. construction grants were available to public agencies in the elementary and secondary school category. to a State TV agency. to public colleges. and under paragraph (a). subparagraph (1) (D). to nonprofit community educational television organizations which could include private colleges and universities as well as other community groups which might be organized on a nonprofit basis to contribute to the excellence of television programing. The effect of the amendment which struck section D and substituted therefor language limiting participation of this program to public agencies only is discriminatory and unfair. Its effect is to deny participation in this very important field of educational television to wellqualified educators who are in a position to make a most valuable contribution in many fields of learning. For example. among others. great universities located in my district. such as Long Island and St. Johns Universities. St. Francis and St. Joseph Colleges would be barred from the program by this amendment. It does not make sense to initiate a broad system of educational benefits to the public at the same time narrowing its base by cutting off and silencing institutions of higher learning merely because they are supported by other than public funds. It is my hope in the HouseSenate conference the original language in the bill will be restored and I will have an opportunity to cast my vote in favor of the conference report.",

Haj Mohammed Marzouk. has retired after spending 85 of his years embroidering quotations from the Koran in gold thread on the enormous black plush covers used to cover the Kaba stone in Mecca. toward which all devout followers of Islam face when they pray. His covers for the holy shrine reach Mecca each year before the arrival of the faithful on their pilgrimage. Mohammed began this service to the Prophet as an apprentice of 10. A few days ago. when his final embroidery was finished. he was retired. receiving a pension of seven Egyptian pounds. or $20. a month after having been classified as a civil servant in the ministry of religion. Then around came the tax collector. to say that the classification was wrong and that Mohammed really was a craftsman who should have been paying income tax at a A2351 rate 5 percent higher than had been deducted from his pay during his working life. The collector thereupon presented a bill for \ufffd212 ($615) in back taxes. To satisfy it. Mohammed was obliged to sell his few household effects. among them his bed and blanket. At 95. he Is down to a ragged coat. without a piastre to his name. The man who covered the Prophets shrine for 85 years hasnt a blanket to sleep under. Somehow we see in this pathetic person a symbol and forerunner of that merciful governmental dispensation known in this country at the moment as the New Frontier.

April 9.-The New England Council announced today that it has asked the White House to conduct a full scale investigation of residual oil import restrictions and resulting increased fuel prices to the New England consumer. The regional economic development organization petitioned the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization to restudy their original recommendations which resulted in PresiA2355 dent Eisenhowers March 1959 proclamation imposing mandatory quotas. Charles W. Colson. Washington counsel for the New England group. said that \"the new quota system announced by Secretary Udall last month is totally unsatisfactory. The Secretary of Interior has said that the new system is intended to permit an adequate supply of residual oil and that the quota would compensate between domestic production and domestic demand. This new system makes the existence of the quota program even more fruitless since it can no longer be said that the system is designed to limit imports. \"We think it is fair to ask why quotas should be imposed at all if they are no longer intended to restrict Importation. Even more than before. the quota system is an artificial restriction on the normal competitive process and tends only to create monopolies in fuel oil distribution. its only result can be increased prices to the consumer.\" The councils formal petition seeks removal of the mandatory quota system and asks for \"an immediate investigation to determine the effect of the residual oil import program on the price of residual oil and other fuels in the East. and to determine the efficacy of the program with respect to the purpose for which it was establishedto promote national security. \"We are convinced that an impartial study by the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization would demonstrate clearly that the residual oil restrictions have not fulfilled in any way the national security objectives of this proclamation. but rather have resulted only in increasing hardships to industry and consumers.\" Nearly 1.000 in Orleans Learn Now.

They have built 625.000 classrooms in the past 10 years. which is over 200.000 more than would have been needed to take care of the 11 million increase in the number of children. In 1950 Congress ordered a national school facilities survey which was completed at a cost of over $5 million and reported a shortage of 312.000 classrooms. In 1954 the U.S. Commissioner of Education said that we were 370.000 classrooms short. Then the figures started coming down. and 2 months ago the Office of Education said that we are 142.000 classrooms shortwhich is 230.000 fewer than 6 years ago. Now. most of these shortages are purely fictitious but. even if they were correct. there would still be no need for Federal action. The Office of Education. taking all of these claims at face value. has estimated that we shall need to build 600.000 classrooms in the next 10 years. or 60.000 classrooms a year. That is the figure which President Kennedy used in his education message. But. States and communities have been building 70.000 classrooms in each of the past 5 years. So. the volume of school construction could substantially decline from its present level and still produce all the classrooms we can possibly use. But. the year 1960 established a new alltime record in school bond approvals. which suggests that school construction will continue at a record level. The State school superintendents reported. In a survey of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. that only 237 school districts. out of a national total of 40.000. were unable to build the schools they need. So. the facts dont add up to a situation which calls for action by the National Government. Dean MANION.

Russian teachers are poorly paid. contrary to some claims. and need two salaries to earn enough for . decent living. They get $100 a month or less for one shift. The Russians have reported that they have built schools to accommodate 9 million children since World War IIand they are not likely to understate their case. American public schools have built classrooms for more than twice that many children and private schools have added space for another 1 / to 2 million. Moreover.

Our great chairman has been exceedingly effective in leading the committee with respect to its decisions on these important legislative matters so that the committee has produced an exceedingly fine record of achievement in the 87th Congress. It is an honor for me to be a member of the committee under the leadership of our admired and respected chairman. and it is a great pleasure for me to subscribe to all the other fine things which have been said about him here today.",

And nowhere has national freedom been in such constant jeopardy as in that part of the world. This is true in the case of many peoples there. and certainly it characterizes the modern history of the Hungarian people. A1847 For centuries these sturdy peasants of Hungary maintained their national independence. fighting their enemies on the east and in the southwest. Early in modern times a part of Hungary was overrun by the Turks. but they still maintained their independence until late in the 17th century when they were brought under the Austrian monarchy. Then for about 200 years they lived as unruly subjects of the government in Vienna. and strove to regain their freedom. In this they were not successful until 1848. In that year the European revolution offered them the chance to free themselves. Disturbances and uprisings in many parts of the Austrian empire weakened the government in Vienna. and the Hungarian patriots in Budapest were ready to take advantage of the situation. Early in March they petitioned the government and demand freedom. On the 15th they were granted freedom and autonomy. and that day of victory and jubilation became a Hungarian national holiday. their Freedom Day. Though the freedom thus regained was lost in the following year. to this day the Hungarian people celebrate the anniversary of March 15. the date that marked their freedom 113 years ago.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is a privilege to join in paying tribute to the heroic Hungarian people on the 113th anniversary of the Hungarian revolution of 1848. This memorable occasion is celebrated by Hungarians throughout the world as a national holiday. The revolution of 1848 in Europe constituted a landmark in the history of many nationalities there. for it was that stirring midcentury event which roused and revived the idea of nationalism and the desire of subject peoples to free themselves from the oppressive yoke of alien rulers. This was true in many parts of Europe. but particularly so in the Austrian Empire. The autocratic government in Vienna was successful in holding down a number of nationalities through the ruthlessly efficient despotism in Vienna headed by that sworn enemy of liberalism. Count Metternich. For more than 200 years Hungarians had been living under Austrian rule. subject to an alien regime in their homeland. Their past attempts to free themselves had not been successful. but the revolutionary events weakened the government in Vienna. and thus assured the Hungarians certain success in 1848. In March of that year they drew up a list of their grievances. presented it to the Austrian authorities in Budapest and demanded freedom. On March 15 the government granted these demands. thus allowing freedom and autonomy to the Hungarian people. That date became a turning point in their struggle for freedom. and to this day it remains as their national holiday. their Freedom Day. On the 113th anniversary celebration of that event we recall also the Hungarian revolution of October 1956 and its ruthless suppression by the Reds. But neither the loss of Hungarian freedom in 1849. nor their subsequent sacrifices in the October revolution of 1956. have dimmed the Hungarian spirit for freedom and independence. In that spirit A1852 they and their friends celebrate their Freedom Day. It is fitting that on this glorious date in Hungarian history Americans express their sympathy and concern for the brave Hungarian people. Basin Work Sped on the Arkansas",

I regret that some of my distinguished colleagues are as pessimistic as they are about the future of our country. about its financial stability. about its ability to meet its obligations and the needs of its people. I go back home also. I believe in the long look. The future of this country depends upon the improved economic position of the average citizen of this country. It depends upon the opportunity for work of the average worker in this country. It depends upon the opportunity for redevelopment of some of the areas heavily stricken by economic recession. Where is the Senator who feels that this Nation. with its increasing annual production. personal income. productive capacity. and production per unit of manhour labor is unable to move into a situation in which up to 40 percent of the people in some communities are unemployed? What Senator would say that the Federal Government cannot stand an authorization of an expenditure of $750 million a year for 1 year. and if the situation deteriorates and unemployment Increases by from 4 percent to 5 percent. we cannot do it the second year? I am astounded that men would talk about the International Monetary Fund as being determinative of what we should do for the employment. or the opportunity for employment of men and women. The action of the stock market has been alluded to. I am not sure but what the stock market reaction is a result of the unemployment in this country as well as other factors envisioned by the distinguished Senator from South Dakota. I hope that rather than to approach the problem from the standpoint of a $250 million grant. with a limitation of an additional $150 million of accelerated expenditure per year for 2 years. that we would take the broad scale view and say that we will move with precision. We will move with vigor. We will not cripple ourselves. We will not tell the people of America. \"Here is a program that will increase employment. It will increase the opportunity to eliminate poverty.\" Some will say. \"No. we will not take the broad view. We will take the program on the basis of $250 million. with the gross annual production at the rate we have.\" Mr. President. I hope that the substitute will not be agreed to.",

    "speech": "I thank the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. The Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress. Nowhere in that document is Congress authorized or empowered to delegate that function to either another branch of the Government or any agency which may be established by Congress. However. S. 2965 authorizes the President to initiate public works programs on a standby basis. These public works programs would be specified. not by Congress. but by the President. The power to appropriate money necessarily carries with it the power and duty to specify the exact programs for which that money is to be spent. In order to preserve the balance of powers between the three separate and distinct branches of our Government. it is necessary for each branch to perform the duties delegated to it and jealously guard against any usurpation of its powers. If this bill is enacted into law in its present form. Congress will have abdicated its sworn duties and have been a part to the diminution of its own powers. It is said that there are adequate safeguards written into the bill to prevent the exercise of indiscriminate power by the President. The safeguard is an administrative determination that the national unemployment rate has increased by 1 percent within a 3- to 9month period. This is no more than a halfhearted pretense at putting reins on arbitrary delegations of power. It by no means justifies the creation of this Presidential pork barrel which is unparalleled in the history of our country. The problems of the unemployed are. and should be. of major concern to all Senators. It is obligatory for us to seek ways and means to relieve the distress which accompanies unemployment for the misjudgments of Congress have contributed to the problem. Nevertheless. in our zeal to do so. we must guard against entrenching upon timehonored and constitutionally endowed responsibilities. I submit that the same endproviding relief for areas suffering from substantial unemploymentcan be accomplished within a framework consistent with the responsibilities of each branch of our Government. No one person. regardless of who he Is or what position he holds. should enjoy the almost unlimited exercise of powers bestowed upon the Office of President by this bill. For these reasons.

Prices are not going up or down because of what we are going to do in connection with the pending bill. We can have different views on that subject. but it does not necessarily mean that the people who are selling are right or that the people who are buying are wrong. It should be remembered that whenever someone Is selling on the stock market. someone else is buying. In my opinion. it must to some extent reflect the uncertainties in the American community as to the capability of this administration to deal with the private economy. There is at stake in all this discussion confidence in the administration to handle the economy of our country. That does not mean that it is the President who is running everything. Nevertheless. I deeply feel that people who are selling have that impression. It does not mean that Congress does not have a great deal to say about it. I hope that Congress will assert itself. I am not deluding myself in respect to this bill. that this is what Congress is going to do about it. The bill amounts to a billion dollars. and the money will have to be appropriated by the Congress. That does not mean very much when we are dealing with an economy of $550 billion and a personal income of $380 billion. So this is not very serious. The bill would give the President authority to do something about spotty situations. If we want to do something meaningful. we had better get to a tax bill and to the foreign aid appropriations. and deal with other measures which are fundamental to the whole economy. Congress had better assert itself to American business. to show that it proposes to participate in the process by which the American private economic system will be helped. and that the solution will not be left entirely to the President. I had intended to speak at length tomorrow on this subject. but I was brought to my feet by the feeling in some quarters that this measure would have to deal materially with the whole economy.

This amendment serves the most important purpose of providing all the funds authorized for fiscal year 1962 for both operation and maintenance and construction assistance to federally impacted school districts. As my colleagues know. last year Congress extended without amendment for 2 years legislation authorizing assistance to federally impacted school districts. School districts across the Nation planned their budgets in good faith and reliance on this congressional action. The existing appropriation is sufficient to pay only 92 percent of the funds authorized for our Nations federally impacted school districts. which now are faced with serious budget problems through no fault of their own. The Moss amendment would do simple justice by amending the LaborHEW appropriation bill to include the required appropriation so that these school districts might meet their budget commitments. This amendment is highly important to my own State of Rhode Island. Without the necessary appropriation authorized in this amendment. Rhode Island will lack anticipated Federal assistance in the form of $26.300 in construction funds and $169.700 in operation and maintenance funds to complete the fiscal year 1962. It seems perfectly clear to me that federally impacted school districts both in Rhode Island and throughout the Nation have every right to expect that the funds due them under the law as passed by Congress will be paid in full.",

Similar legislation was enacted for cornmeal. grits. and white flour in 1959 as section 201 of Public Law 86341. and the Senate has previously passed such legislation for rice. Section 201 originated in S. 651 of the 86th Congress. which included rice. Following hearings. S. 651 was incorporated in a clean bill reported as S. 2522. It passed the Senate as part of H.R. 8609. As it passed the Senate. it included rice. In conference rice was dropped from the provisions of section 201. The testimony on S. 651 pointed out that various jurisdictions require enrichment of rice offered for sale. and the 100pound burlap bags in which rice was donated were too heavy to handle for the women who prepare school lunches. and that they tear. and take in dirt and moisture with consequent loss. The committee has recommended two amendments. both of which were suggested by the Department of Agriculture. One amendment would provide that fortified parboiled rice of equal nutritional value not be required to be enriched. The other would permit donation of any commodities covered by section 201 of Public Law 86341 in containers in excess of 50 pounds when requested by the recipient.",

Mo.. under dateline of Wednesday. July 19. 1961. headed \"In Clinton. Flood Control Gains Big Support.\" It occurred to us that the editorial is worthy of reproduction for the reason that the meeting about which A6036 1961 CON( the editorial is centered becomes a rather unique event when 500 people attend and very few. If any. oppose a reservoir project. The editorial Is as follows: over the last -few decades. Federal flood control projects normally have encountered strong opposition. While most people recognize the imperative need of reservoirs and levees for farm and city protection. a few dissenters always have been highly vocal. It is significant to note therefore. that a. public hearing on flood control last week in Clinton. Mo.. failed to produce the usual objections. The Kansas City office of the Mississippi Valley Association reports that \"the meeting was utique in that there was no opposition voiced\" to the proposed Kaysinger Bluff Reservoir project. Some 500 people attended. Kaysinger has stirred much enthusiasm among the people of west central Missouri who realize the tremendous recreational possibilities. Aid It is Interesting to recall the controversies that other big reservoir plans have occasioned In the past. Tuttle Creek. for example. The bitterness caused unfortunate delays. Obviously. the general public cannot be expected to react with unanimous favor to flood control projects that take over large agricultural areas and townsites. But the Clinton meeting suggests that more and more people realize how essential are the protection and excellent recreation that flood control provides. Higher Education and the 87th Congress",

The timing of this release on the eve of consideration of the foreign aid authorization bill underscores the obvious hope that pressures will be generated back home to bring Members of Congress in line in support of this bill. I can assure the Housethat the strategy will not work so far as I am concerned. and I suspect will not work so far as the overwhelming majority of my constituents is concerned. The report shows that for the 6 year period. foreign aid expenditures in the State of Michigan totaled $20.044.067. The expenditures during this period in cities in the Third Congressional District of Michigan are listed as follows: Battle Creek. $444.906. Coldwater. $408.089. and Kalamazoo. $278.532. or a total of $1.131.527 for the Third District. In my judgment the attempt to sell foreign aid on this basis Is a phony. Whatever the immediate and transitory economic benefits to my State. district. or communities. It is the type of economic benefit and gain which would reA6045 suit in a far more solid fashion from normal trade relations or transactions abroad. It is a charge against the taxpayers of the Nation. including the taxpayers of Michigan and the Third Congressional District. I would venture the guess that taxpayers of my district would be ahead in terms of financial benefit through tax savings if the foreign aid expenditures were sharply reduced or eliminated. and I am positive they would welcome the tax relief which this would involve. The simple truth is that if and insofar as there is any justification for foreign aid in terms of the national interest and security of the United States. that is the sole justification for such expenditures of tax funds. The effort to justify this program and its expansion on the basis of dollar returns in my district strikes me as lacking economic validity. The attempt to promulgate this type of information as part of the lobbying campaign for the foreign aid bill strikes me as political blackmail. In Today Already Walks Tomorrow",

In selecting Worcester as the outstanding Massachusetts City of 1960. the government research bureau of the University of Massachusetts remarked on the amount of citizen action here. The same point won Worcester an All America City Award from the National Municipal League. These awards are encouraging. They should stimulate further effort at community improvement. not blur over the difficulties we face. As the Arthur D. Little. Inc.. report brought out. Greater Worcester has economic problems of some substance. Such episodes as the rejectionat least temporarilyof a new zoning ordinance demonstrate that there are political problems. too. It is hard for everyone to agree on what the common welfare demands. Yet this Is basic to a united effort to meet that demand. We think the awards for Worcester are well deserved. This is a good city. and it is getting better. How much betterand how fastdepends on the time and energy that all those who caxe about the community are willing to invest in improving it.

Hacker before the Womans Club of Teaneck. N.J.. on February 27 of this year. has just been brought to my attention. It is an excellent reminder of the immense contributions which three great Americans. Washington Lincoln. and Edison. have made to oir great country. Mrs. Hacker is the wife of Ralph E. Hacker. one of our leading New Jersey architects. In June she was presented with a well deserved citation in commemoration of her great patriotic and civic work upon the occasion of her retirement as president of the New Jersey chapter. National Society for Constitutional Security. A Baxnard graduate. Mrs. Hacker received her master or arts degree in public law from Columbia University. She served on the committee which rewrote New Jerseys State constitution in 1947 and was the recipient of a Latin American citation for her work in the field of education and toward world peace. She also served as chairman of legislation and civics for the New Jersey State Federation of Womens Clubs and of the Barnard development fund in Bergen County. She also has held the office of vice president in the Womans Club of Teaneck. Affiliated with many civic. educational. and university groups. Mrs. Hacker is presently first vice president of the National Society for Constitutional Security. Under unanimous consent I include her fine remarks printed in full in the Appendix of the RECORD:",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. I realize that the marketing agreement provisions of agricultural legislation are very complicated. However. I am moving to strike this provision because this amendment was not given consideration except in executive session of the committee. There are in the potato industry the socalled late States. a tier of northern States from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Seventy percent of the production and marketing of the potato crops come under the marketing agreement regulations. These are agreements under which growers have participated and which were established through exhaustive hearings. To amend this legislation at this point without giving the growers an opportunity to be heard is. I think. improper legislative procedure. I am familiar with the background of this amendment. I am not quarreling with the sincerity of those who are proposing the amendment. but I do object to the procedure. I think the growers ought to be heard. They have a very deep interest in these marketing agreements and. in my opinion. this type of procedure is not the constructive way to amend such complicated legislation. I would point out to the members of this Committee that the marketing orders used by the potato industry in the Lake States. from California to Maine. are not price orders in any sense of the word. They are grade and size orders which are used to help market the best portion of the crop and reserve for other uses. particularly nonfood uses. those portions of the crop which are not of high marketability. What the processors have in mind. and this is a legitimate request. of course. is to have access to those off grades and sizes. particularly to those potatoes which are not required to be in their original form or are mashed or dehydrated. This is a matter in which both the processors and the growers have an interest. I do not think this legislative procedure in this context is constructive. nor is it in the growers interest. If you are interested in the growers and processors having an equal opportunity to present their views before amendments of this type are made. I sincerely urge the committee to approve the amendment and to strike this provision in order that this subject matter can be presented in a sound. legislative way. giving all parties concerned an opportunity to express their views.",

Packers who can or freeze potatoes are exempt from marketing orders. Dehydrators are subject to marketing orders. This could promote unfair competition between a processor who cans and freezes potatoes and is not subject to marketing orders and one who dehydrates potatoes and is subject to marketing orders. This section of the bill clarifies this situation. It is not right for a processor who is a canner and freezer and dehydrator to have half of his line subject to the marketing orders and half exempt. Think of the confusion and unworkability. This section merely puts dehydrators in exactly the same exempt position as canners and freezers.

N. Mex. Howard McMurray lived a fruitful life. a life in which he was able to weave together his deep interest in both politics and education. He was born at Mount Hope. Kans.. on March 3. 1901. After working for a life insurance firm. he was able to complete his education and obtain his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin in 1936. After his graduation. he joined the faculty as an instructor in political science while he continued his own studies. He obtained his doctorate in 1940. He was serving as an assistant professor when in 1942 he was elected to the House of Representatives from the Fifth District of Wisconsin. He left his seat in the House of Representatives in 1944 to wage an unsuccessful race for the Senate. In 1946. he followed this with a courageous campaign against the late Senator Joseph McCarthy. During his term in the House of Representatives. he was a strong supporter of our war effort against Hitler and an even stronger supporter of moves to secure the postwar peace. He had a deep interest in the Atlantic Union and other international organizations which could provide a way to settle international disputes without resorting to war. As the war drew to a close. he often spoke out for sanity in reconversion to a peacetime economy. and he worked hard toward that end. After his retirement from politics. he went to teach at the University of New Mexico. He was a professor of government there at the time of his death. I know.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. yesterday. when the very able and sincere gentleman from Michigan . a member of the Committee on Appropriations. was discussing this bill. he told us he had always supported the policy in the past but that he could not go along as long as the bill contained that provision for backdoor spending. I assume that a compromise will be offered to us in order to sweeten the bill and. speaking in common language. to buy a few votes for its support. That is all very well. but as far as I am concerned. the bill. in my judgment. is not good and I cannot go along with it no matter what amendments are adopted. Of course. those who are opposed to backdoor spending can get off the hook if we put in the Gary amendment. or some other amendments but that does not seem to me to be the answer the people are entitled to have. The gentleman from Michigan also condemned the waste and worse which has been inherent in our spending in connection with this program and. as proof of that waste. cited four reports of the Hardy subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations. Since 1952. the gentleman from Michigan . and since 1959 the gentleman from Michigan have served faithfully and consistently on that subcommittee and both have joined their chairman. the gentleman from Virginia . a lifetime Democrat. in his critical conclusions and recommendations. The conclusions of the subcommittee show that. in the most charitable view. our money has been spent neither wisely nor economically. Those subcommittee reports were adopted by the full committee. As a matter of fact. there are eight reports by the Hardy subcommittee. all adopted by the full committee. and. as I read them again this morning. each and every oneand the conclusions cover many pageshave little. if anything. complimentary to say about the efficiency of our spending or the good which may grow out of it. Each and every one is bitterly critical of the inefficiency and waste. 1 (1) U.S. technical assistance in Latin America14th intermediate report. Committee on Government Operations. H. Rept.

I have not yet found anybody who knows why that figure was picked. There does not seem to be even In the illustrative presentations such as have been made In the annual appropriation processes of the past. The figure of $8.8 billion appears to have been picked out of the air. It might have been $10 billion or $2 billion. There is not a shred of evidence I have heard anywhere to prove that this $8.8 billion is the amount of money needed to do the job. This Is also a surplus property disposal bill. Look at section 608 on page 46. line 3. to page 47. line 19. Do you realize that all foreign excess property. whatever the amount. is available for the economic part of this program? It will never be sold. In addition domestic surplus property to the extent of $35 million in any 1 year is a socalled advance fund. Now. we have generated in 1959 $1.3 billion worth of foreign excess property. in 1960. $1 billion. and in the 9 months of 1961. $700 million. Now. these amounts. by the sections I have referred to. are made available for aid to schools and hospitals overseas with American sponsors. By the way. we have Federal aid to education in this bill. Look at section 214. pages 12 and 13. Now. H.R. 8400 waives all kinds of restrictions and standards for contracting except for the Renegotiation Act. Look at page 75. H.R. 8400 waives civil service classification laws on certain personnel. And. this is a good one. I just heard the gentleman refer to Cuba. It permits aid to Cuba if the President wants to give it. Look at page 61. Then look at the very next sentence which says that no aid shall be given to any country dominated by international Communists.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in wholehearted support of the necessity for a substantial and effective program of foreign aid. It is the most promising instrumentality by which we can hope to advance the social and economic attainments of peoples less fortunate than ourselves. Humanitarian considerations therefore require it of us. It is one of the most effective weapons we possess for winning the cold war. Selfpreservation therefore. also requires it of us. For we cannot escape the cold war. We have no choice. The Communists have chosen to make us their enemiesnot we they. To abandon foreign aid at this point would be to capitulate in the cold waraction which is intolerable. Furthermore. it is plain that an effective foreign aid program needs to be based upon planning extended over several years. Nevertheless. in making provision to allow such planning. we must act within the framework of our own basic law. To do otherwise is to undermine the very principles upon which our greatness rests. To me. the issue on this question is simple. On January 3. 1961. all of us took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. Article 1. section 9 of that Constitution provides that \"no money shall be drawn from the Treasury. but In consequence of appropriation made by law.\" In my opinion the provisions of the legislation before us which authorizes Treasury borrowing over a 5year period. violates the spirit of this portion of our Constitution. It is my fervent hope that its provisions authorizing Treasury borrowing. will be eliminated. They are not essential to longrange planning. Such planning can as easily take place under an authorization from Congress for a program of foreign aid extending forward for a period of years. Four years would be a sensible time period because it would not extend beyond the administrations present term. Such authorization. requiring annual appropriations from Congress for its progressive implementation. would not do violence to our Nations organic law. I could enthusiastically support an amendment making such a change. I hope to have the opportunity of doing so.",

I served with him on the Committee on Armed Services and for a time his office was on the same corridor as mine in the New House Office Building. I passed it daily. And I sometimes wondered if his office was ever closed. Even on Sundays he would invariably be at his office. He was a tireless worker who loved his work. I do not believe anyone could be more conscientious. If anything. he was too conscientious. He asked more of himself than could possibly be expected of any man. It is typical of him that he did not allow himself sufficient time to fully recover from an operation. with the result that he had to be readmitted to the hospital and a few days later passed on to eternity. OVERTON gave his life in his conscientious effort to serve his people of Louisiafia and his country. As chairman of the important Committee on Science and Astronautics. he carried more than an ordinary burden. He had the innumerable and truly perplexing problems that one faces in organizing a new committee and of a committee which would have jurisdiction over a subject only in the embryonic stages. OVERTON BROOKS served as a pioneer and his dedication to his work resulted in the many things that have been accomplished by this new standing committee of the House. No job was too big for OVERTON. Nor could he be assigned too many jobs. The bigger the job. the more duties and responsibilities he had. the better he liked A7908 it. H eought always to serve. And he served well.

As chairman of this subcommittee. it is my hope that the National Labor Relations Board and the General Counsel will implement the findings of our subcommittee as quickly as possible. I believe the findings and conclusions of this subcommittee represent a sincere effort to make the National Labor Relations Board a more effective instrument for carrying out national labor policy in our country. I do not agree with the views expressed in the minority report that our hearings were either a forum for criticism of the Board as constituted under the previous administration. or that our recommendations are a forerunner to the repeal of the TaftHartley Act. Anyone who will take the trouble to study the transcript of proceedings of this subcommittee will find that the hearings were conducted in a completely impartial manner and that exceptional efforts were made to assure the minority on the subcommittee full opportunity to crossexamine at length those witnesses who had presented testimony criticizing Board procedures. The transcript will further show that this subcommittee had analyzed procedures of the Board prior to the Eisenhower administration and that indeed the sole purpose of this investigation was to afford Congress an opportunity to review the operating procedures of this very important agency of Government established by an act of Congress. As regards any suggestion that the findings and conclusions represent an effort to repeal the TaftHartley Act. anyone taking the time to read the subcommittees report will have to conclude such a conclusion is totally unfounded. It would appear that those who make such suggestions have not read the subcommittees recommendations. As chairman of this subcommittee. I am in complete agreement with the Honorable ROBERT GRIFFIN. of Michigan. a member of the subcommittee. who. in his separate views of the report. stated that these hearings have served a useful purpose and that they can indeed serve as a basis for some constructive legislation. The subcommittees findings and conclusions follow:",

Hadassah has grown from a handful of dedicated individuals devoted to the ideals of their religion and the problems of public health nursing to the largest Jewish womens organization in the world with active interests in public health. medical research. child rescue work. vocational education. social welfare. and land reclamation. Clearly. this is no organization withdrawn from society or prone to righteous pleading: it is an actual organization. There is no gap between its beliefs and its practical undertakings. The expansion of the activities of the association came in response to the calamities of disease. ignorance. poverty. and war. Its devotion to these universal and unending tasks has not eroded its patience nor its energies in coping with them. Its health activities have fulfilled pioneering roles not only in Israel but also in the newly developing AfroAsian countries. Hospitals and medical teams have conducted work in Monrovia and Tanganyika. and medical education is supplied to students from many countries of Africa and Asia. Hadassah is an example of the close affinity of spiritual values and practical service to mankind. Its outlook is not narrowly sectarian but broadly humanitarian. In pursuit of its aims it has cooperated with other service organizations. such as the National Citizens Committee of the WHO and the National Civil Liberties Clearing House. I congratulate Hadassah in its golden jubilee year as an outstanding group dedicated to the highest ideals of democracy and good will. Ceremonies Honoring Wisconsin Decendant of Civil War Hero",

He also used every opportunity to keep in touch with America and his countrymen. And in return. American Slovaks responded generously to his pleas for aid and relief. especially after World War II. when eastern Slovakia was mutilated and over 170 villages were razed. During these crucial years. Bishop Cirsky made the best out of the worst situations and kept the faith and hope alive in the hearts of his flock. Thousands of Slovak visitors from America. especially before World War II. made special trips to his historic cathedral in Kosice. metropolis of eastern Slovakia. just to receive his blessing.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the city of Anchorage. Alaska. is fast becoming a major center of international air travel. This summer about 10.000 people will stop at Anchorage every month on their way to Europe. Japan. and other destinations in the Far East. One particularly interesting aspect of this travel is that many who stop at Anchorage are passengers from one foreign country to another. They stop at Anchorage while their planes refuel and go on to a country other than the United States. Anchorage is the only American city ever seen by these passengers. For many of them it will be their only chance in a lifetime to see the United States. It is a regrettable brief glimpse of our country. Mayor George Byer. of Anchorage. has sponsored a unique program for showing America off to the visitors to Anchorage to the limited extent that it may be possible in so short a time. Mayor Byer. seeing the opportunity to inform travelers from other countries about America during their stop in Anchorage. is now seeking assistance from the Federal Government to make this possible. It is a most worthy and worthwhile objective. The mayor envisages an international reception center at the Anchorage Airport where there would be interesting displays of Americas cities. its culture. and its way of life. Here our foreign visitors in transit would glimpse a little bit of the United States and. it is hoped. gain a friendly feeling toward this country which should show good results in all our international relations. I take this opportunity to salute Mayor Byer for his good idea in behalf of better international relations. and for his energy in seeking his goal. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of these remarks a news story about Mayor Byer and the international reception center at Anchorage which appeared in the Washington Post and Times Herald on June 21. 1961. be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. recently the Vice President of the United States. speaking in California. called attention to the very serious situation that has resulted from Khrushchevs recent and continuous remarks in relation to Berlin. Communismthe international conspiracy aiming at world conquestcontinues to be the major threat to our security and peace. To win against this harddriving system will require a greater dedication by the American people and the free world. Particularly in the propaganda battle. Mr. Khrushchev and his henchmen are especially effective. Regrettably. for example. there is increasing evidence that Communist propaganda is convincing people not only inside and outside the Iron and Bamboo Curtains. but also even more gravely. convincing people in America. To my just dismay. there is a prevalentand growingfatalistic feeling among the American people that Khrushchev may be right: that communism will one day surpass our free system. This is a tragic and dangerous trend in U.S. thinking. If we cannot dispel such apathy and fatalism then. indeed. we may be doomed for failure. Fortunately. this kind of thinking still represents only a minority. not majority view. nevertheless. it is evident enough to be alarming. It is true that. following World War II. U.S. citizensparticularly through taxes. mutual aid. and other programscontributed substantially to stopping Communist expansionism. However this is not enough. Whether we want to become aware of it or not. this is an allout lifeanddeath battle. We will not survive by a \"let Georgeor Uncle Sam alonedo it\" attitude.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in the entire history of our Nation the most important and farreaching legislation in the field of Federal aid to education. next to the LandGrant College Act of 1862. was the World War II GI bill. Educators. legislators. and professional men of both major political parties state almost to a man that the World War II GI bill and the Korean conflict GI bill had an invaluable impact on the lives of millions of Americans and upon the progress and development of our national economy. The need for a similar education bill to educate and train veterans of the cold war is so overwhelming that it is astonishing to me that we have not already established such a program. For example. statistics show that the previous GI bills gave this Nation 450.000 engineers. 150.000 physicists. chemists and other scientists. 180.000 doctors. nurses. and medical technicians. and hundreds of thousands of other professionally and technically trained citizens. This Nation sorely needs hundreds of thousands of additional professionally and technically trained people today. One phase of this need for greater numbers of technically trained Americans was pointed up in an excellent article by Mr. Frank C. Porter. a staff writer for the Washington Post. He reported: The Engineers Joint Council estimates that some 264.000 young men and women will graduate from Russian technical institutes this year against 16.000 from equivalent U.S. schools. This single stark statistic throws into relief Americas lagging performance in the scientific race. Our output of toplevel scientists and engineers is bad enoughfor every American university graduate in technological fields the Russians graduate three. But in the category of engineering support personnel. which includes graduates of technical institutes. our showing is even worse. The ratio is better than 15 to 1 in favor of the Soviet. Mr. President. the cold war veterans GI education bill. S. 349. would be a long step in the right direction for meeting this problem. It offers us the opportunity to reestablish a proven program that would be of vast national interest as well as beneficial to millions of individuals. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the RECORD the text of the aforementioned article by Mr. Porter. which appeared in the June 17. 1961. issue of the Washington Post under the heading. \"The Gap in Technical Training: 34YearOld CREI Seeks to Relieve Shortage.\"",

House Resolution 572 which makes in order the consideration of a bill from the Committee on Agriculture. the Senate bill. S. 2533. I would merely point out further. Mr. Speaker. that this bill should not be construed as authorizing or bestowing any special benefit on any special area or to any special group of farmers. It merely provides that. due to the lateness in the passage of the wheat program for 1963. farmers in the Great Plains area who planted winter barley as a cover crop on some wheat ground to prevent wind erosion may harvest that barley under certain conditions. Perhaps you can remember back during the Dust Bowl days. the great devastation that took place in the high plains area in the spring of thc year when the ground was not covered with some kind of vegetation that would prevent this wind erosion. The farmers this year went ahead and planted barley for a cover crop on ground retired from wheat production under the 1961 act. This bill merely provides that they may proceed to harvest the barley since they went to the expense of planting it and preparing the ground. But they must take from their feed grain allotment for this one year the number of acres that will be harvested from this fall planted barley. It is just as simple as that. It will not cost the Department of Agriculture anything. in my opinion. It will not increase the feed grain supply by any measurable amount of bushels at all. So I certainly urge the adoption of the rule and favorable consideration of the bill. I do not know why there has been so much delay and why this failed once under suspension of the rules and failed once on the Consent Calendar.

We have the wording of Senator CARLSONS bill before us. which makes the meaning of this legislation abundantly clear. Farmers have made their decision on the land in their fall plantings. Last year. I felt that the bill which we considered was an inducement for a farmer to plant additional barley and thereby create additional competition for the historic barley growers. However. they have made their decision. but some have planted winter barley on the acres to be diverted from wheat. If we do not pass this bill they will have to plow under that barley and go to the expense of putting in grain sorghums. In order to save the farmers that cost and at no greater governmental expense. we have this legislation now pending before us. If we save the farmers that cost. undoubtedly more of them will want to take part in the 1962 feed grains program and the feed grain program will then be more of a success. Mr. Chairman. I might point out. however. that the farmers who chose to plant their diverted acres to wheat in order to prevent the land from blowing will have to plow under that wheat. whether this is sensible or not. For those who chose to plant barley this bill comes as a real break. This is not in any way going to add to the total acreage of feed grains. but only substitutes barley for grain sorghum.

His amendment would have done practically the same as the bill we are now considering. But in the processing of this legislation. the other body did not have it included in their bill. Later it was taken out in conference and that is the reason for the introduction of H.R. 8914 on August 28. 1961. I appreciate the help we have had from the committee on this bill. I appreciate the help we have had from both sides of the political aisle here. I appreciate the support from the gentleman on the north side. Mr. DOLE. who represents practically the same area of Kansas as I do. We are both in unity on this bill and we both support it.",

At this time last year the passage of the captive nations resolution caused great stir in the Kremlin. with Mr. Khrushchev openly admitting his concern. This is understandable. for the captive satellite nations together comprise the Achilles heel of international communism. The courageous uprisings in Hungary. Poland. and East Germany vividly evidenced great internal unrest within the Soviet Empire. Each refugee is dramatic living proof of growing dissatisfaction with totalitarian puppet regimes thinly disguised as \"peoples republics.\" It is significant that this last weekend a record flow of over 4.000 refugees sought freedom from such tyranny in West Berlin. In reaffirming that these existing Communist satellite regimes do not legitimately represent them. we offer some hope to these captive peoples. Unfortunately. in the past. we have not always acted in accordance with our expressions of support for their struggle for freedom. Nevertheless. by refusing to recognize Soviet domination. we assure these people of our continuing inA5516 terest in their cause and admiration of their spirit. In the meantime. we express our sympathy not only to them. but to the newly emerging nations that are endeavoring to realize their destinies by selfdetermination. This observance emphasizes to the world that we still adhere to the principles of our Founding Fathersthat governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. and that when government becomes destructive of these ends. it is the right of citizens to alter or abolish it. In brief. Mr. Speaker. we proclaim the right of people everywhere to be their own master and not to remain captives of any commissar or dictator. nor be obliged to confess any creed except one compatible with conscience.

Since World War II. millions of people in the captive nations who once knew freedom and national independence have been held under the domination of Soviet Russia and have suffered the denial of individual liberty and have been subjected to the cruel tyranny of Communist rule. The United States as a nation is dedicated to the principles of national independence and freedom of the individual. The people of this Nation stand firm in their determination that liberation must come to those nations now held against their will and subjugated by the Soviet Union. The United States will never compromise with liberty and freedom. and \"it is important that the people of the captive nations know that the position of this Nation and the American people is firm. and that the free world will not waver in its determined stand for the liberation of the captive nations. Observance of Captive Nations Week in the United States serves notice once again to Communist Russia that this Nation supports the cause of freeedom throughout the world. and that our efforts will continue ceaselessly to achieve deliverance of the captive nations from Soviet bondage.

Against this we must consider the proposal by five electric companies to market power from the project to the Departments customers over a joint system of utility company and Federal lines. This issue will involve basic congressional policy with respect to the marketing of Federal power and it would be well for us to know just what that policy is and how it has evolved over the years. The need for a Federal power marketing policy came to a head when large quantities of Federal power began to be available from large multiplepurpose projects that had been authorized in the late thirties and early forties. It was not until the Flood Control Act of 1944 that the policy was first expressed in legislative language. It was further evolved in connection with the Southwestern and Southeastern Power Administrations. and the Bureau of Reclamation. From the outset this policy has sought to strike a balance between Government and industry. It has avoided encouraging the growth of one at the expense of the other. but at the same time it has striven for maximum results in terms of benefits to the Nation as a whole. It has at no time permitted the Department of Interior. the sole marketing agent for most Federal power. to assume an allinclusive. dominant role by constructing allFederal power systems to the exclusion of industry or nonFederal groups. Instead. it has encouraged and promoted cooperative. joint development in every- case possible. As a result. no Interior Department power marketing agency today has a completely allFederal system.

A number of years ago when I was the ranking minority member of the Comnittee on the District of Columbia an incident arose which caused me to have some part in the recognition and the advancement of Mr. Duncan. The then President Truman had sent up a nomination for the position of Recorder of Deeds in the District. which upon examination in the Committee on the District of Columbia. did not appeal to the members of that committee. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. PASTORE I. who is now in the Senate Chamber. may recall that following some interrogation of the nominee for the position of Recorder. members of the committee felt a little reluctant to recommend favorably the nomination that had been submitted. As a result of that hesitation. I introduced a bill to give tc the Commissioners of the District the responsibility for the selection and appointment of a Recorder. That bill was acted upon favorably. Then the Commissioners named Mr. Duncan to the position of Recorder. which position he has held and conducted with honor. I never knew anything about his politics at that time. Therefore he is primarily a bipartisan in office. He believes in serving the people well in whatever responsibility is assigned to him. As I have known of him and his activity. I have come to have a very high regard for his ability.

I wish to commend my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee who have worked so diligently to bring to the floor H.R. 8028. the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act of 1961. This gives the Members a chance to support a very important measure for the welfare of our future citizens and for the welfare of our society in general. The need for Federal legislation in this field has been amply demonstrated. The conditions involved not only affect the large communities of our country. but spread like a contagious disease to suburban and rural areas. I have sponsored the forestry camp legislation in Pennsylvania in 1955 and had the pleasure of seeing the law enacted which created the two camps now in operation. Gov. David L. Lawrence in his testimony predicted the opening of a third camp in a very short while. This effort on the State level represents supplementary action to the $51/2 million spent in the present fiscal year for the operation of delinquency institutions in the Commonwealth. The city of Philadelphia has also tackled the problem with a special program started in July of 1959. using the social group method. The Philadelphia Youth Conservation Corps operates as a preventive program for potentially Juvenile delinquent boys. The main objective of the corps is to combat. prevent. and diminish juvenile delinquency. The city budget for this purpose is $174.000. The city of Philadelphia has had splendid leadership in this field under Commisisoner of Welfare Randolph E. Wise and for many years has had professional guidance from Dr. John 0. Reinemann. director of probation of the municipal court of Philadelphia. Dr. Reinemann said: In the juvenile delinquency field. specifically. Federal aid to States and their political subdivisions for demonstration projects in the area of prevention. control. and treatment of this social ill. as well as for more adequate training of personnel in police departments. courts. training schools. correctional institutions. and other agencies engaged in any phase of this vitally Important work. Is urgently called for. I am glad to join the committee in support of this bill and I hope that the measure is enacted into law in this session of the 87th Congress.",

My understanding of this measure is precisely the same as that of the gentleman from California. so I will not repeat his statement but simply ask to be associated with his remarks. May I simply say in addition to his remarks that the maintenance of General Aniline & Film Corp. as a strong. productive. and competitive organization under the control of nonalien interests is important to the public interest and welfare and would promote the national interest. The proposed legislation would accomplish this. while at the same time safeguarding private interests through Its provision for substituting the proceeds of sale or just compensation for the property itself. Also important is the factor that this legislation would make it possible for the Government to rid itself of its unnatural role as owner of a private competitive business. The property will be sold to the highest bidder. The money will go into the U.S. Treasury. In my opinion this legislation is long overdue. We ought to get rid of the ownership of this last piece of property which we are operating as a going concern and dispose of it in this particular way.",

There were major U.S. loans to our wartime allies (the largest of which was the British loan in 1946 of over $3.7 billion on easy terms) and loans by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank).

He was our first modern President with a concept of the world mission of the United States. The Manhattan brownstone was owned by the Roosevelt family when Theodore was born there October 27. 1858.

I also noticeand this has particular reference to my own section of the countrythat corn prices have dropped 6 percent since last year. in a comparable period. These are matters of high interest. in view of the fact that the omnibus farm bill is presently before the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. and I apprehend that in one form or another it will be before the Senate at possibly a reasonably early date. So this is a matter of information that I want to impart for the information of the Senate from time to time.",

I have beenI have been often critical of the broadcasting industry. I have often questioned some of the things that they were doing in the way of programing or in the way of allocations. I have been critical of the FCC on some occasions. I know they have a most difficult problem. I have been critical of the FCC mai:nly because they have sometimes it seems to me they have failed to face up to decisions. they let them sweep them under the rug. just let them go. That was the allocation situation. I think Mr. Minow. who made this dramatic appearance before the national association here last week. stated a lot of things that I had been thinking about or maybe I had talked about here and there and put them together. I think its good to have in this new industry with all its problems too. to have \"a pike in the carp pond.\" once in a while. And. Mr. Minow surely evidenced the fact that he is going to be a pike in a carp pond. Now. sometimes we fall into patterns in business or what seems to the people in the broadcasting business to be right to them but they fall into patterns and we drift along. I wouldnt quite say that it was a vast wasteland. I think there are many practical problems that are involved. But programing. of course. all of us want to be programers. I have my idea of what programs should be but I am not going to censure programing because the people there want to do as good a job as they can. I think the broadcasting industry has done more in the past 2 years to become better. to fulfill their responsibility better than it did in the prior 10. and I have lived with them forwell. they made me a pioneer the other day of broadcastinga long time. but I think they have done an excellent job in the past 2 years.

This is a very complicated issue which relates directly both to the public interest and to the rights of inventors to keep the fruits of their inventions. America has been known for its creative genius. It is important that we help preserve it. There are different points of view with regard to the Government patent policy. Some believe that the general public interest takes precedence and that the Government should. therefore. take the patent rights to all inventions produced by individuals or corporations under contract to the Government. Others have claimed that while the public interests must be preservedit is contrary to the system of free enterprise for the Government to accumulate patent rights. It has been believed of the latter group that patent rights should be kept by the inventors. while the Government merely takes a license. I believe that these hearings of the Patent Subcommittee will help clarify the thinking in this area. Recently there has come to my attention a statement by one of the leading patent attorneys of the State of Wisconsin. William E. Van Taay. on this matter.

This is not only the anniversary of founding of the Republic. which took place on June 2. 1946. 15 years ago. but this year marks the centennial of the unification of Italy. One hundred years ago. when our own Nation was in the struggle between the States. the people of Italy were having their own struggle for unification. Italy was united. and 85 years later. they formed their Republic. The relations between our country and the Italian Government have been most friendly. The international relations between our Governments have been in every way pleasant and agreeable during the time Ambassador Manlio Brosio has been his countrys representative here in Washington. and I am sure that the same agreeable relationship will continue under Ambassador Sergio Fenoaltea. the Italian Governments new Ambassador to Washington. We say a fond farewell to Ambassador Brosio. who has been transferred to another important post. and a welcome greeting to Ambassador Fenoaltea. Soon after the formation of the Republic of Italy. it became a strong ally of the United States in the fight against communism. and since that time Italy has been a stanch and indispensable partner in the European recovery program and in the North Atlantic Alliance. Italys identification with the aims of Western democracies has been reaffirmed by its leaders throughout this period. The stalwart support of NATO by Italy has been constantly evident. Indeed. our partnership with Italy is firmly rooted. as has been shown in our harmonious dealings with international issues as they arise. Furthermore. in the family of free nations. Italy has shown her sincere desire to do her part toward the solution of the world problems. I am not. on this occasion. going into the long list of gifts which Italy has given us. That has been done on previous occasions. We are all fully aware of these thingsand we are grateful to Italy. At this time. I simply want to extend congratulations and best wishes to the Italian people and their leaders. I also want to extend congratulations and best wishes to the many Americans of Italian descent who celebrate this day.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I oppose the omnibus housing bill. S. 1922. It is both extravagant and inflationary. This 89page bill would authorize as much as $9.3 billion in additional Federal loans and grants for housing. Nearly all of that vast sum would require some kind of backdoor Treasury financing. Excluding public housing. the bill contains $6.2 billion for new and existing housing programsonly slightly less than the $6.4 billion legislated for the same existing programs ever since they were started. Everyone recognizes the need for sound housing and better neighborhoods. These and other needs. in fact. seem almost unbounded. In contrast. Federal resources available to meet them are limited and are already strained. Even without this bill. the budget deficit for the fiscal year 1962 will be at least $4 billion. and probably much more. Contributing to next years deficit will be an estimated $949 million in net outlays for existing housing programs involved in this bill. Enactment of S. 1922 would further increase the budget deficit in fiscal 1962 by an estimated $462 million. or by nearly half a billion dollars more. Under these circumstances. the Federal Government should not underwrite the additional inflationary burden that this excessive housing bill could impose. The bill contains more than $9.2 billion in loans and grants requiring some sort of backdoor Treasury financing. Approval of the bill would mean that. subject to specified limits. the Congress would lose control over the amount and timing of these backdoor housing loans and grants. in some instances for as long as 40 years. This would be true. regardless of other demands upon the Federal budget and regardless of future conditions in the general economy or in the housing market. The additional $2.5 billion in grants for urban renewal in this bill. for example. would be finally expended from 4 to 10 years hence. For public housing. the additional $3.1 billion in this bill could be laid out in annual grants of as much as $78.7 million each year until at least 2001 A.D. Already. the budget for fiscal 1962 will include $426 million in net outlays for urban renewal and public housing which will be made under previous authorizations enacted as long ago as",

This aid will go into works and projects that can be expected directly to affect the peoples of Latin American countries and bringing about perceptible improvements in living conditions and aspirations. The program. which was outlined last year by President Eisenhower and authorized at that time. is not a hasty move to combat Castros efforts. It has been under study and development since 1958 when then President Kubitschek of Brazil suggested Operation Pan American to meet the problem of social and economic betterment as well as development throughout the hemisphere. The aim of the program is social progress. by overcoming the barriers of geographical and social isolation. individual illiteracy and lack of educational opportunities. archaic tax and land structures. and any other such institutional or traditional obstacles to broad participation in economic growth. The cooperative efforts that are beingexerted by the United States and other Latin American nations present a stark and vivid contrast to the tactics now being pursued by Castro and his Communist mentors. Government by firing squad. expulsion of priests. closing of mission schools. and a continued influx of Soviet military advisers reveal beyond doubt that Castro is a lot more concerned with maintaining his own position than he is with helping the people of Cuba. Under Castros guidance. Cuba is rapidly becoming a horrible example for the whole hemisphere. a warning more effective than mere words. as to what communism really means. The appropriation now under consideration should give the United States a welcome opportunity to show our true colors. our genuine concern for economic progress and for political freedoms. I hope that the Government will administer the program with good judgment and sympathetic understanding for Latin American problems so that the money here appropriated will bring maximum benefits for our neighbors to the South.",

Get a group of dedicated women committed to you and working for you and you have it made.\" These dedicated women have always been devoted to Speaker MARTIN.

Restricted stock options are bad policy and they should be prohibited. If no publicly owned company and no bank were permitted to grant these incentives. their use in the competition for executive talent would. of course. be eliminated. I strongly believe that this is a source of very bad competition. since every institution or company. in order to keep its management and/or employees. must constantly vie with others in the same field by granting more and better incentives. This is bad enough in industry generally. but is directly contrary to the public interest in the banking field.

Although the Federal Reserve and Treasury officials had been following the balanceofpayments situation over a number of years. the October 1960 gold crisis dramatized the longdeveloping problems in the U.S. balance of payments and helped to bring about a decision to meet with European treasury and monetary authorities on a regular basis. The working party meetings were set up in May 1961 and have continued since that time. as follows: (a) Working party No. 2Economic growth: The Treasury is represented by J. Dewey Daane.

While local and State authorities in recent years have made valiant efforts within their resources to provide additional compensation to teachers commensurate with their positions.

Much has been said. but still far too little done. to help meet the continuing crisis in our schools caused by the flight of teachers to betterpaying jobs. With this in mind I have introduced legislationH.R. 11527which would allow teachers of public and nonprofit private schools to exclude from their gross incomes in any one year the first $1.500 of their salary earned.

However. the wise man and the prudent Nation profit from the lessons of history. There is an old saying that history repeats. which brings to mind the terror and destruction caused by enemy submarines off the Atlantic coast only a generation ago. Exactly 20 years ago this month of May. German Uboats sent 14 U.S. tankers to the bottom. after sinking 12 in February. a dozen more in March and the same number in April. The loss of 50 tankers in 4 months is a grim reminder that the Nazis were in almost undisputed possession of the waters of the entire Atlantic coast during the early months of the war. Could history repeat? Does any foreign power possess a submarine fleet sufficiently large and powerful to cut off military installations and defense industries located along the east coast from their supplies of foreign residual oil? Are our defense mobilization planners taking into consideration the proper precautions to avoid dependence on an unreliable source of energy? Senator ROBERT C. BYRD recently has recommended to the President that a survey be made of our military installations and defense industries. from Florida to Maine. to determine the extent to which they have become reliant on foreign fuel. transported by tankers. conceivably menaced by another formidable wolfpack. I wish to commend the gentleman from West Virginia for his perspicacity. vigilance. and sense of public responsibility in focusing attention upon a vital matter. The survey he has called for could prove of tremendous future benefit to the security of our Nation.

Freedom of the human spirit. he says \"is at the core of positive thought. it is the driving power between creativity and progress.\" I agree with this inspired Oklahoman that \"we must search our souls. minds. and hearts.\" about what we are doing to keep trimmed and burning this torch of freedom. and that \"thinking and praying people must meet the challenge of our century.\"",

So was her interest in veterans welfare. In both respects. Mrs. ROGERS excelled In committee work. and during World War II she served as the lone woman on the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Her pen it was that set down the terms of a law curbing American trade with the Japanese dictatorship.

Recently. a $100 million loan was made by our Government to that regime. making a total of $1.8 billion in loans and grants since 1949. On practically every occasion when our country has extended help. the Tito regime. practically concommitant with our Governments granting of help. has designedly. it seems. redeclared his intense faith and loyalty in the Communist cause. These declarations have occurred with such similarity and repetition that the inference is justifiably made that the recipient. Tito. feels obliged to tell the Communist governments around the world that while he accepts our help. he wants them to understand that they are still the governments by which he will stand in the event of international difficulty. We have provided $75 billion by way of help to foreign countries since World War I. We have been unselfish in our purpose to help the devastated nations of World War II. and the undeveloped countries in the world at present. Our people have been magnanimous and willing to be of help. At present. we are having serious difficulties as a consequence of the adverse balances that we are suffering in our international trade resulting in a measure from the outflow of our dollars as they are being supplied to help foreign countries. I feel quite certain that our citizenry groans in agony when it reads of these words of praise expressed by Tito on the philosophy of communism and which impliedly constitute a tirade upon our system of government and life.

The extractive industries. such as a mining company. may go into a country that offers unusual tax incentives- There is an incentive by the Canadian Government of 3 years with no taxes. Such a corporation sets up a subsidiary in Canada. ships ore into the United States. into the American domestic market. for the American domestic blast furnaces for the American steel industry. and displaces American industry. American miners. and American workers. The Senators amendment simply provides that if the purpose of a foreign subsidiary is not that of developing an international market for a commodity produced under an American name by an American corporation. but if the purpose is to displace American products in the American market with foreign commodities or foreign products owned or controlled or manufactured or extracted by an American company. and if such companys interest is over 10 percent of the total volume of the business. it shall be taxed at American corporate rates. This is the amendment that really gets at some of the problems some Representatives and Senators have been concerned about. namely. taking jobs from American workers and displacing American workers and American production. The same thing happened with respect to the radio industry. wherein radio parts that are manufactured in another country are brought into this country under the terms of the American corporations foreign subsidiary. and are placed on the American market after they are packaged into a unit called a radio. and sold on the American market. with little or no American labor or plant involved.",

It deals with the amount of income or earnings a beneficiary under social security might have before there would be a reduction in benefits. Under existing law it is $1.200. plus the formula which takes it up to $1.750. This would simplify it by making it $1.800 without any reduction in benefits. I think the amendment needs no further discussion. because it has been before the Senate for a period of years.",

There have been times when the Senator from Oklahoma has been the author of a similar amendment. However. that was in connection with a social security bill. and in connection with action by the Congress to provide the additional revenue for the trust fund which would be required to meet the cost of benefits which would accrue to the beneficiaries by reason of the amendment. Much as I sympathize with the objective of the distinguished Senator. I know he is aware that adoption of the amendment would cost hundreds of millions of dollars a year. which money would be taken out of the oldage and survivors insurance or social security trust fund. I urge the Senator not to press the amendment to this bill. but to wait until a social security bill is before the Senate. when we shall also be considering raising additional revenue to meet the costs of additional benefits which would be created by the amendment.",

I have stricken out that amount and inserted $12.000. The bill provides that $20.000 of earned income may be excluded from the individuals tax base if he lives abroad for up to 3 years. However. in the case of a U.S. citizen who has been a bona fide resident of a foreign country for more than 3 years. the total amount which may be excluded under the bill in this case is to be $35.000 per year instead of $20.000. The Gore amendment would reduce the earned income exclusion to $6.000 for a taxpayer who lives abroad for an uninterrupted period which includes an entire taxable year. My amendment is identical to the Gore amendment except that the amount excluded is $12.000. I hope the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma will give serious consideration to accepting the amendment. Since I live in close proximity to Mexico. I know that people earning a dollar abroad have a higher purchasing power than people in the United States. That is true in many countries. It seems to me that $1.000 a month is a pretty generous exemption from taxation to allow a person. I invite attention to the fact that that is twice as much as was contained in the amendment proposed by the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. He would have exempted $6.000 a year. or $500 a month. The proposed amendment would exempt $1.000 a month. or $12.000 a year. of the years income. I have no further statement to make.

The amendment would treat them all in the same category and exempt the first $12.000 of earnings abroad from any taxation here. I have taken the language of the proposed Gore amendment. which would reduce the exempt amount to $6.000 and. in my amendment. changed the figure to $12.000. It would apply to both categories. It would apply to the U.S. citizen who had been a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries more than 3 years. and it would apply to the U.S. citizen who had been a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries less than 3 years.

Dr. Sterling McMurrin. who had served as U.S. Commissioner of Education for something less than 2 years. called together the staff of the Office of Education to bid them adieu. But he gave more than a warm personal message. He spoke to them of his philosophy. his philosophy of education of public service. of life in all its aspects. Dr. McMurrin is a scholar. and a civilized man. But scholar though he is. he has never confined himself or his thoughts to an ivory tower. to a world limited by academic walls. He was appointed by a Democratic President. but Sterling McMurrin followed no partisan political pattern. no partisan political procedures. he followed the dictates of his conscience and the mandates of great thinkers of all ages: the eastern wise men. the classic Greek philosophers. the leaders who gave the world the JudeanChristian code of moral living. and the thoughtful writings of the scholasticists of the Middle Ages to the beginning of modern philosophy. With this knowledge he sought to give direction. but never directives to education. He spoke of the tremendous importance of the individual and sought to emphasize the overwhelming necessity today for the personal and the intellectual integrity of the individual. I do not plan here to comment editorially on the speech he made. extemporaneously to his staff on his last day in office. His speech calls for widest dispersal. All thoughtful Americans should have the opportunity to read it and ponder its message. American education may well be guided by it. all thoughtful school people will be inspired by it. I trust it will not mark the departure of Dr. McMurrin from an active role in shaping policy for American education.

To fortify this conclusion one needs but to look at the results which our foreign aid program has attained in these few short years. Rather than extending freedom throughout the four corners of the globe. we are now faced with the firm entrenchment of the international Communist conspiracy just 90 miles from our shores in Cuba. It is readily apparent to me. and I believe that it should be to everyone. that it is folly to assume that we can buy the respect and friendship of foreign nations. The respect which the United States deserves as the foremost defender of liberty in the world has. from the inception of our Republic. been earned and not bought. The undeveloped and underdeveloped socalled emerging nations should be treated with the same firmness of purpose and honesty which has gained the United States the respect of our longtime allies. It should be considered by them to be an act of international blackmail if we attempt to gain their respect and friendship through the coercive influence of the root of all evil--money. I submit that this is exactly the case in the world today. These socalled emerging nations will naturally turn their allegiance toward any nation or group of nations which wields power. and by that power. commands the respect of the socalled uncommitted nations. If the United States is to maintain and strengthen its role in international affairs. we must seek to gain. not just the friendship of the peoples of other countries. but the respect of all peoples in other countries. even our enemies. To do this we must remain strong economically. as well as militarily. and stand firm in our convictions. demanding what is our right through treaties and international law.

I ask unanimous consent that this newsletter. entitled \"Foreign AidBoon or Boondoggle?\" be inserted in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I believe that the Senate has abdicated its constitutional duty when the wording of the House of Representatives in sections 107 and 109 of this bill. H.R. 13175. was rejected. It has been argued both during the consideration of the appropriation and when the authorization legislation was before the Senate. that the executive branch has the responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs. I certainly agree with this argument. but I fail to see that it has any application in this instance. Congress. and Congress alone. has the duty to appropriate funds from the Treasury of the United States. The power of appropriation carries with it the power to determine who or what country will be the recipient of these funds. By adopting the Senate Appropriations Committee language. the Senate has said: \"We dont want to make this determination. We will leave it to the President.\" I firmly believe that this is too great a burden for any one man to shoulder. The President should welcome a congressional determination in this field. and Congress should. by all means. be willing to face up to the problem.

Federal legislation may in effect continue the migrant worker many. many years longer than he would be continued If we continue the way we have with research and emphasis on ways to eliminate the problem by eliminating the work. Now. our basic belief is that the centralization of power in the central Government or Federal Government. power and authority. and encouragement of lack of responsibility by individual citizens is one of the greatest perils that we have to the future of our Republic and to our competitive enterprise system. It has not been demonstrated that increased Federal responsibility improves the conditions for these people and this Federal legislation is an entering wedge to be broadened out. its really a part of the campaign on the part of the monopoly powers in labor to organize and control the food industries just as they are commencing to control the transportation industry.",

Well I want to first of all give Mr. Shuman every credit for good will and a good heart. but the fact is. notwithstanding the good will expressed here. the average American migratory farmworker right now makes less than $900 a year. His youngsters are falling further and further behind in education. He does not receive any of the public health and welfare services that all other poor Americans receive. He las not had the opportunity to benefit from a floor for wages. there is no minimum wage that applies. His youngsters are not protected. they are excluded from the provisions of the child labor law except for during school hours. Wherever you look for those legislative efforts to make the beginning of a better life. the American migrant farmer and his family have been left out. They are truly outcasts. Our legislative program deals with every. almost every item. those that we understand at least. the wages. economic conditions. the situation of the children. and opportunity to join in labor unions. yes.

This matter was brought to the attention of my colleague and myself when the Range Telephone Coop. Inc.. at Forsyth. Mont.. made an application to purchase the telephone system of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. at Lame Deer. Mont.. on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. The local community was not receiving telephone service. and the agency switchboard was not being used to capacity. because its services were limited to the local Bureau offices and facilities. When there are existing utilities and when there is a demand for the service.

The purchase or construction contract is a private undertaking between the seller and buyer. and the rights and obligations of the parties would. in the final analysis. depend upon the provisions of such contract as interpreted by the courts of the particular State. In other words. these poor fellows must hire a lawyer. go to court. and sue a vast corporation in order to get their rights. despite the fact that the words \"FHA insured\" are attached to every contract and are used in advertising the house.

If it be our national policy. as has so often been declared by successive administrations to promote peace in the world. it seems to me this would be one area in which we would try to bring about our desire. If we used the means at our disposal we could do it. I see no reason why we should make these large loans and grants to Nasser without requiring or at the very least requesting a promise from him to cease his belligerent tactics and his determination to destroy the little State of Israel. which is wholly inoffensive and nonaggressive. It desires only to live and let live. Instead of planning to exterminate Israel the Arab States should emulate Israel. which has been engaged in programs of sanitation. irrigation. and education to lift the standards of living of its people.

I have always thought that this subject was a very difficult area in which to legislate. The basic consideration of the conflictofinterest statute is that a Government official should not do business with himself. Technically. the Government official should meet that requirement by divesting himself of his stocks or financial interests in an enterprise which. by reason of background or by reason of his philosophy. might operate in such a way that there could be a definite conflict between the best interests of the Government and the interests the official might pursue. I have always thought that it was a difficult field in which to legislate. We might say to an individual. \"You divest yourself of your stocks. You divest yourself of your holdings.\" However. I know of no way in which we can legislate to have a man divest himself of his basic philosophy of life or his basic interest. The problem is. in the final analysis. to determine whether a man has that kind of character and those convictions and ability which will let him operate on the basis of the interest of the Government. whether or not he holds certain business interests. I believe that a statute states the Government shall not receive uncompensated services. The purpose of that statute certainly is that when a man works for the Government he is supposed to work for the Government. and place that employment in the primary and not secondary position. So I hope the Senator from Wisconsin will proceed with his statement. I recognize that he has assigned to himself an unpleasant duty. to go into this subject.

It was my pleasure to appear before the committee in Mr. Connallys behalf. Perhaps my statement now could be considered to be somewhat biased. in a sense. It is my unusual pleasure to have known Mr. Connally for a great many years. both personally and businesswise. Therefore. I wish to express especial appreciation to the Senator from Wisconsin for accepting Mr. Connallys position as that of a man of high moral standing in our Nation. One further thought: In reaching the position of conflict of interest. would It be considered that because a person had been associated or closely allied with a certain particular industry. that he might have influenced. he might be accused or suspected of a conflict of interest? For instance. only a day or so ago I had the great pleasure of voting to confirm the nomination of former Governor Freeman to be Secretary of Agriculture. I thought one of the outstanding supports for Governor Freeman was not only his understanding and knowledge of the problems of agriculture. but also his interest in agricultural problems. With that statement. and not desiring to speak any longer. I was wondering if this theory were to follow: If the great. distinguished. outstanding military record of Mr. Connally in the Navy would be called upon to stand against his qualifications to be Secretary of the Navy.",

The Comptroller General cited several instances in which these two carriers charged the Government far in excess of the rates which were being charged at the same time to the commercial shippers between the same points.

These shipments involved the transportation mostly of wheat and barley. The Bloomfield Steamship Co. overcharged the Government $270.380 on 19 shipments. while the Lykes Bros.

Mr. Chairman. if I may proceed to one additional point. the gentleman from Louisiana has already stated that he will offer an amendment to increase the military assistance appropriation by $175 million. I want to share with the committee the figures which I have. which will indicate the magnitude of the military assistance program as it will appear in this bill. if the amendment of the gentleman from Louisiana is adopted. The amount in the bill is $1.3 billion. The amendment which is to be proposed would increase that by $175 million. There is $100 million unobligated and available to the military assistance program. There is $50 million which has been deobligated and which has been authorized for reobligation. There is $300 million in the authorization bill which can be used as a transfer of stocks. Incidentally. it can also be used to pay people the salaries which they earn in teaching other nations how to use their stocks and can also be spent for packaging and crating. to ship goods abroad. and the like. Therefore this $300 million. a new military assistance contingency fund. must be added to other funds which are available for military assistance under this program. Mr. Chairman. this adds up to $1.925 billion as being available under the legislation which we will have adopted this year for military assistance. This compares with an authorization of $1.7 billion in the public law which has just been signed on yesterday by the President. and the request by the administration of $1.885 billion. In other words. if all of the matters which I have mentioned as contingencies should actually come to fruition. we will have appropriated or authorized the expenditure of $40 million more for military assistance than was requested by the administration. and $225 million more than was authorized.",

Mr. Chairman. I submit that the mutual security program is designed to assist these people. and that it is not imperialistic. Mr. Chairman. the question before us today in my opinion is not so much the dollars in this bill. although it would appear to some reading the newspapers that we had cut the appropriation.

As a member of the Appropriations Committee. although I am not a member of the subcommittee. there is nothing in this bill as I understand it that does not give the administration everything it needs. It has received all the money it has requested from the Appropriations Committee. It is my understanding that in some of these areas it is more money than they had expected.

I do not recall any amendments being offered in the full committee to replace the military reductions. and. as stated. I was in touch with the top echelons in Government. including our distinguished majority leader. It was indicated and agreed upon that they would like to see $150 million restored to the military item. All hands agreed that this was sufficient. The gentleman from Virginia . understood it. I said: \"Let us put in an additional $25 million. so there can be no misunderstanding whatsoever.\" When you have satisfied the people downtown and satisfied the leadership on either side of the aisle. why all the pressure now? To be perfectly candid with you. we are giving them in excess of what the minimum requirements would be. After we reported the bill last year you put $200 million back in the military item here on the floor only to find they did not need it. This year we recommended $1.300 million. I am going to recommend $175 million more. after these consultations. which is more than the people downtown agreed they would be satisfied with. We are reappropriating $50 million of unobligated funds. They will also have $100 million available in deobligated or dereserved funds. They also have available authority to draw $300 million from Defense Department military stocks. These sums total $1.925 million. So. who are we trying to satisfy here?

In short. Mr. President. the proposal is endorsed by the entire domestic sugar producing and refining industry. All the differences. all the issues to which the Secretary of Agriculture referred last August. have been resolved since January. Ever since we took the necessary step of barring Castro sugar from the American market. the domestic industry has labored under the handicap of a series of shortterm extensions of the Sugar Act. It is high time wethe administration and the Congressfaced up to the situation and enacted a realistic longrange Sugar Act. The uncertainties which have attended the series of shortterm extensions of the Sugar Act have plagued the entire domestic sugar industry. not the beet sugar industry alone. The cane sugar refiners. for example. are equally hampered in their operations. The largest of those refiners. the American Sugar Refining Co.. in its annual report issued last month. said: The outlook for 1962 remains unsettled. The temporary extension of the Sugar Act expires June 30. 1962. Although shortterm legislation was a necessary expedient following the cutoff of supplies of raw sugar from Cuba. the entire sugar industry needs equitable longterm legislation to remove the uncertainties that have been hampering operations. Mr. President. this underscores the urgency of congressional action on longrange sugar legislation at the earliest possible time. I am indeed hopeful that an administration recommendation will come to the Congress soon. and that it will realistically recognize the place the domestic sugar industry should have in our sugar market.

Communists have received indoctrination In the strategy and tactics of revolution in the Lenin Institute of Political Warfarein the Academy of Red Professorsin the Sun Yatsen Universityin other training schools in Moscow. Leningrad. Prague. and other Communist cities. These institutions graduate Russian and foreign students as professional fighters in all forms of conflictpolitical. ideological. psychological. economic. cultural. and technological. We have nothing comparable in America. On February 9 this year a bipartisan group of 12 Senators. including myself. joined in sponsoring a bill. Senate bill 822. to establish a Freedom Commission and a Freedom Academy to outthink. outsmart. and outmaneuver the Communists on cold war battlefronts all over the world. The Freedom Commission would have the task of developing a systematic. integrated applied science of nonmilitary action appropriate to the cold war struggle. The Freedom Academy would offer courses in this applied science of nonmilitary warfare to persons from many walks of life: Government personnel. teachers. trade unionists. businessmen. clergymen. and others. Foreign students also could receive instruction at the Academy. Last August a similar bill passed the Senate without objection. President Kennedy was serving in the Senate at the time.

John Sylvester. U.S. Navy. furnished on March 10 of this year. presents an alarming. yet not insoluble situation: Under the most optimistic assumptions. and on a quantitative basis only. the United States still possesses a marginal capability to carry out the sea transportation tasks of a general war. There are serious qualitative deficiencies in our overall sealift capability. particularly in the drycargo ship and the transportpassenger ship categories. The further aging of outmoded ships will aggravate this situation. The present rate of new shipbuilding will not offset the rapidly approaching block obsolescence of the vast proportion of U.S.controlled merchanttype tonnageboth active and reserve. There is an urgent need for increased emphasis on orderly ship construction. The continued depreciation of ships in the national defense reserve fleet without cyclic purification will soon generate serious quantitative deficiencies in our total sealift capability. Crash building programs in wartime can only be avoided by maintaining a modern and adequate maritime posture in peacetime. In limited or general warfare. as well as in times of cold war. the merchant marine has an important function. and if the administration and the Congress take resolute action. the conditions which the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations describes can be promptly and economically corrected.

Time and time again. over a long period of time. I have urged that these laws be reappraised. reevaluated and modified to enable American industry to survive and keep our faithful American workers employed. Day by day the situation is getting worse and is drastically affecting a broad spectrum of American industries. old and new. I hope that every Member of the Congress will read this excellent article because it points out very clearly the dire threat that current socalled reciprocal trade is posing for American industries and millions of workers and their families--indeed for our entire economic system. It is clear that if some way cannot be found to check the impact of this increasing cutthroat competition from abroad. our industrial strength will wane and our economic system will be facing disaster with business failures and widespread unemployment. As I stated so many times. I strongly favor every possible measure of profitable trade and commerce with other friendly nations. I am very anxious to support every and any law that would bring about this desirable result. But foreign trade. as it is now being conducted under the trade treaties. is a oneway street. and while imports rise. exports decrease. It should be evident that the Congress must take early action. if we would preserve here in this country the proper climate for our free enterprise. industrial prosperity. fulltime employment and national progress and advancement commensurate with the dynamic demands of the space age.

Lets have no more talk about the Joint Chiefs of Staff and/or the CIA being responsible for this fiasco. Mr. Speaker. the record is clear and I submit herewith the article by Mr. Murphy that does in fact set the record straight. I urge all Americans to read it and request unanimous consent to Include herewith as a portion of my remarks the abovereferenced article.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday I was privileged and pleased to join 360 Members of this House in support of the postal longevity bill. legislation designed to establish a more equitable method for granting longevity step increases for postal employees and thereby correct a gross injustice in the Government service that has existed far too long. A7694 During the course of the debate on this bill some very interesting facts were revealed. For instance. in excess of 80 percent of postal clerks and carriers spend all their working lives in one salary level while other Federal employees who come under the Classification Act advance to other salary levels. And. further. that twothirds of the employees of the postal service are in level 4 and are frozen there. rarely having the opportunity to move to higher levels. For this reason longevity pay is vitally important to them. We. in this country. have come to expect and indeed. demand prompt and efficient handling of our mail and we do not hesitate to complain on those rare occasions when orderly delivery is disrupted. However. the Congress. whose responsibility it is to provide compensation for Federal employees. has not been - so prompt and efficient in giving recognition to and rewarding the dedicated postal clerks and carriers who provide us with good and faithful service. I was not appointed a member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee of the House in time to vote for the postal longevity bill in committee but I wish to express my appreciation to the committee on behalf of the postal employees in my district for their favorable action on this legislation. It is my hope that the measure will become law as quickly as possible. Mr. Public Health",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a very important gathering of nutritionists and marine scientists from throughouf the world is currently underway in the Capital. the FAO International Conference on Fish in Nutrition. More than 300 delegates from some 50 nations are in attendance. They are here to evaluate the place and potential of fishery products in the health and diets of the peoples of the worldmore than half of whom suffer some varying degree of malnutrition. The most important business of the conference is the presentation of more than 100 scientific papers. Particularly stressed during the meeting will be the importance of fish as a source of animal protein in forms which can be made available to remote sections of the world. such as the recently developed highprotein food: fish flour. I have spoken in this Chamber before on the subject of fish flour and of the unnecessarily restrictive Food and Drug Administration ruling that it should be considered unfit for human food because it is. made of the whole fish. This is an unfortunately narrow interpretation of the food laws and one that does not consider the urgent worldwide need for such a remarkable new food. Other nations. as evidenced by the wide participation in the FAO conference. recognize the potential of fish flour and I am very hopeful this present obstacle to fullscale production can be overcome. I am inserting in the RECORD for the consideration of my colleagues two important papers on fish in nutrition. I urge my colleagues to note also the comments and insertions on this same subject by the Honorable OTIS PIKE. of New York. and Senators SMITH and SALTONSTALL. of Massachusetts. all three of whom were quick to recognize the importance of whole fish flour. The first paper I commend to your attention is titled \"Evaluation of Fish Flour in the Treatment of Infantile Malnutrition.\" was prepared by a team of scientists at the BritishAmerican hospital in Lima. Peru. I am excluding charts that accompanying the report. as they would mean little to the laymen. The second paper. by B. C. Guha of the University of Science and Technology of Calcutta.

Mr. Lucki and Mr. Fingulin are members of the United Auto Workers Local 971. which has a collective bargaining agreement with an employer there. The collective bargaining agreement provided that if a worker produced more than 100 percent of the standard production agreed upon. the worker would be paid for the extra work. Mr. Lucki is the father of eight children. Working on a normal basis. producing 100 percent. he would have earned $114 in 1 week. Because of the financial need of his household. Mr. Lucki worked in excess of 100 percent. and thus earned $144 in a week. The officers of the union. in spite of the right of the members of the union to produce in excess of 100 percent. told Mr. Lucki and Mr. Fingulin that they will not be permitted to work to their full capacity. and that if they did. charges would be preferred against them by these union leaders. Mr. President. here is an example of dictatorship within a uniondirecting a worker not to do what. as a citizen and under the collectivebargaining agreement. he had a right to do. The newspapers of Ohio have published the story under the heading of \"The Crime of Working.\" Mr. President. I merely wish to warn that this type of action does not lend credit to those who are trying to promote the cause of labor. No citizen. especially under the Constitution. and also when proceeding under rights given by a collectivebargaining agreement.. should have his rights denied him by arbitrary dictatorial orders. issued by anyone including labor leaders.

If we leave it out we will be misunderstood around the world. Let us not forget that when Mr. Stevenson offered the U.S. resolution in the United Nations in respect to the socalled commendatory resolution. agreed to by the United States and Russia. he talked about a global satellite system. and he talked about the role of the United Nations in respect of international rights of all nations in space.

Obviously. the Senate is not in a mood to consider these amendments fully on their merit at this point. at least. that is the impression I have gained. The language in the Morse amendment was offered by the administration. It is the opinion of those who represent this Nation in the United Nations that this language should be contained in the bill. Without this language in the bill. it fails to recognize that this is an international problem which cannot be settled alone by any nation. Our Acting Ambassador to the United Nations testified before the Foreign Relation.. Committee that there is a real question as to the legal rights of any nation in space. It was agreed that during the International Geophysical Year any nation could put a socalled satellite in orbit. but there is even a real legal question as to whether any nation can properly possess any satellite in orbit around the planet. because it could well fall within the definition of a celestial body. which is free to be explored and used by any nation. In my judgment. the case made for the amendment before the Committee on Foreign Relations was a most compelling one. and the amendment should have been agreed to. Unfortunately. the Committee on Foreign Relations did not agree to any amendments. I believe this is one amendment which should be agreed to. There is a serious question whether a nation has the right to park a satellite over the property of another nation. or even be in a position to spy on another nation at all times of day and night over what could be claimed as that nations air space. These are international problems which must be negotiated. and the role of the United Nations is most important in that connection.

My colleagues on both sides of the aisle. and the Members of the Senate are fully aware of my activities to give FedA424 eral assistance to areas of chronic unemployment.

For 5 years in a row former President Eisenhower recommended area assistance legislation. In his veto messages Mr. Eisenhower pointed out that the legislation passed \"would have frittered the taxpayers money away in areas where it was not needed and on programs that would not have benefited those truly in need of help.\" In his budget message submitted before the new administration took over. Mr. Eisenhower again recommended Federal aid for areas of chronic unemployment.

The pride that I personally feel on the completion and utilization of the Wilkesboro Dam is exceeded only by the vastness of this reservoir and the sustaining waters which it controls. The long and tedious efforts of all those responsible for this wonderful project is relegated now into the archives of mans efforts to constantly improve his environment and harness the forces of nature to meet his everexpanding needs. Progress is born of sacrifice. and sacrifice is the element that makes for a more sincere appreciation of all progressive endeavors. The community and the area which has provided this lastingly useful project is to be congratulated for giving this monument of achievement to the State of North Carolina and deserves the congratulations of all. This hardwon proj ect carries with it the great lesson that always where there is a will there is a way. Secretary Hodges was Governor of North Carolina during a crucial period when this project developed.

This is a thorough committee of which I am proud to be a member. We listened to many witnesses. including the Deputy Attorney General. and also the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. One witness surprised me because he objected to the bill. During the course of the testimony it developed that he had never read it.

My colleague the senior Senator from Oregon knows of my respect for him and his principles. and in most cases. his thoughts. but I would dissent from what I heard earlier: If the Senate does not now face up to this bill. and either pass it or reject it after debate. in my opinion. it will not be of advantage to our party in November.

Leaving out all other arguments of those who are for the bill. the point that bothers me is that if we have an operable communications satellite system. we would have a better position in that meeting. The U.S. Government cannot be in a strong position at the meeting if the United States does not have an operable system. The satellite today is only an experimental satellite. Unless we pass a bill to spell out policy regarding the system. we shall be sitting in left field at the meeting. For that primary reason we went ahead expeditiously with consideration of the bill. I assure the Senate that Russia will have a communications satellite in space before that meeting. So will some of the other countries. So we must pass some kind of measure to put the U.S. policy regarding our system in order so that the U.S. position at the conference would be strengthened if the operable system was operated by private carriers or a combination of private carriers with others.

The dual objectives of this bill that the Internal Revenue Service be authorized: (a) to perform special statistical services for State and local governments. and (b) to admit State and local tax enforcement personnel Into its training programs originated with the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. on which I am privileged to represent this House together with the gentlewoman from New Jersey and the gentleman from New York . Last year I introduced H.R. 9413 to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission in this connection. The bill now before the House contains the provisions of H.R. 9413 with certain improvements worked out by the Committee on Ways and Means with the advice of the Treasury Department. It will make statistical services available on a cost basis to all eligible parties requesting them. and will open the training programs to employees of local and State governments. It is a good constructive piece of legislation. It will make it possible for the Internal Revenue Service to assist State tax agencies on a reimbursement basis. as contemplated by the Advisory Commission in H.R. 9413. Also. it will permit the Internal Revenue Service to apply the amounts received in payment for these services to reimburse its own appropriation account. I commend the Committee on Ways and Means and especially its very able chairman for a fine contribution to FederalState cooperation in tax administration. a contribution all the more noteworthy in view of the large volume of legislation which that committee has had to handle this session. Mr. Speaker. this legislation will be extremely helpful to local and State tax administrators.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. reserving the right to objectand I shall not object because this bill is one I introducedthis bill was introduced at the suggestion of the Tariff Commission as the only way in which a discriminatory situation could be corrected. What is involved here is the elimination of import duties on certain foliages. most of them grown in northern Italy. which are not grown in the United States. These foliages are used in this country in the manufacture of items for decorative and display purposes. They are sun bleached. The bill does not affect domestically grown foliages which are bleached chemically. including. for example. holly. Present tariff protection for these raw materials remains unchanged. Favorable reports have been received for this legislation from all administrative departments concerned. as well as the Tariff Commission and the Bureau of the Budget. The Department of Commerce pointed out in its report. and I quote: The products for which duty free treatment is proposed are raw materials for use in manufacturing products which must meet heavy import competition. The net effect of this legislation would be a reduction in the materials costs of U.S. manufacturers and hence an improvement in their competitive position. This Department is not aware of any domestic industry that would be adversely affected by H.R. 12109. It therefore favors adoption of the bill and removal of the duties as proposed. I might add that the Department of Labor also called attention to this same desirable effect. While this action on the part of the Congress in approving H.R. 12109 would have beneficial effects for a few small firms dealing in these foliages. and no known adverse effect on any other segments of our domestic economy. the overall effect on our exportimport picture is insignificant. Total value of imports on these foliages in 1961 amounted to only $168.000. I mention this figure only to assure the house that H.R. 12109 was introduced simply as an attempt to correct a discriminatory situation that is working a hardship on a few small manufacturers over the country.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the purpose of H.R. 12109. which was introduced by the distinguished minority leader of the House and unanimously reported by the Committee on Ways and Means. is to transfer to the free list of the Tariff Act of 1930 certain bleached foliages used as ornaments and decorations. Foliages of the kind covered by the bill are sold principally to jobbers who in turn sell to floristsupply houses and decorators for use in making wreaths and other ornaments. The imports consist chiefly of bleached ruscus. wheat. and eryanthus. The Tariff Commission reported as follows: Imported articles consist mainly of foliages not grown in this country. Only the better grade eryanthus competes to some degree with the pampas grass grown in the United States. Domestically grown wheat is not used for purposes of ornamentation or decoration because of the difficulties involved in treating it and because of the high cost of gathering it. It appears that imported foliage complements rather than competes with domestic production. The Department of Agriculture reported as follows: U.S. imports of bleached natural grasses and other natural materials have increased markedly since 1948. amounting to $168.000 in 1961. These imports. virtually all from Italy. consist chiefly of sunbleached natural foliages. not grown in the United States. Hence imports tend to complement. rather than compete directly with domestic varieties. In addition to the reports from the Tariff Commission and the Department of Agriculture. your committee received favorable reports on this legislation from the Departments of Commerce. Interior.

Mr. Speaker. under present law. situations covered by this bill are not covered since a woman who is married but does not file a joint return is not entitled to claim a childcare expense deduction unless she is legally separated from her husband under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance at the close of the taxable year. Present law places a limitation on the childcare expense deduction allowed a married couple which requires them to file a joint return and further requires that the maximum $600 deduction be reduced on a dollarfordollar basis to the extent that the joint incomes of husband and wife reported on such a return exceed $4.500. In the situation with which the pending bill deals. however. the wife has been deserted by and cannot locate her husband. thereby patently precluding her filing a joint return with him. The bill provides that the fact that this situation exists must. in effect. be verified by having the wife apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate legal process to compel the husband to pay support or otherwise comply with the law or judicial order regarding such matters. In this situation. Mr. Speaker. the Committee on Ways and Means was of the opinion that it is only reasonable and equitable to subject a woman in these circumstances to no stricter limitation on the allowance of a childcare expense deduction than would be true in the case of an unmarried woman or a widow.

KNox. and which. as amended. is unanimously recommended. is to provide for the imposition of a duty on imports of certain bread and for the removal of such duty under certain conditions. This bill will provide for the assessment of a duty of 71/2 percent ad valorem on imports of certain bread. This duty will not be applicable during any period when the principal supplying country of such bread in calendar year 1961 extends dutyfree treatment to U.S. bread of the same kind imported into that country. For several years now. imports of bread from Canada have created a problem for U.S. bakers who market their products in cities located along the Canadian border. This imported bread sells at a lower price than domestically produced bread and because of this lower price such bread imports are adversely affecting the U.S. border bakeries in the markets in which the two products compete. While the United States grants dutyfree treatment to imports of Canadian bread. Canada maintains a duty on U.S. bread which currently amounts to 7 V2 percent. The circumstances concerning this border trade in bread are such that your committee does not believe that there should be a differential in tariff treatment as between the two countries. For this reason. the bill. as amended. provides that the 7/2percent duty will not be applicable during any period when Canada extends dutyfree treatment to the types of U.S. bread in question.",

Currently we extend dutyfree treatment to imports of like Canadian bread into the United States. Canada. on the other hand. maintains a duty on U.S. bread amounting to 71/2 percent. This has caused a problem for U.S. bakeries along our northern border in States such as Michigan. Domestic bakeriesparticularly those which are of local origin and are independent from the large national chainsare not able to compete with cheaper Canadian breads entering duty free. Furthermore. they are not able to create Canadian markets because of the duty which Canada maintains. At such time as Canada sees fit to open its markets to our bakeries. the duty imposed under the bill will automatically cease to apply. It is necessary that we pass this legislation to insure the continued existence of these domestic bakeries. Therefore. I urge your favorable consideration.",

We find a trend. too often. to teach young Americans how to fit into our social structure with the result that they assume no real identity at all. satisfy themselves with little more than economic security. and contribute less. eventually. than if they were robust individuals. Dr. Marcella R. Kelly. asssistant superintendent of schools in Holyoke. Mass.. has devoted her life to education. Even more than this. though. she has made a lasting contribtuion to a vital area within the realm of education. She has developed comprehensive programs to give our youngsters the theoretical and factual background of our democratic way of life.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the Nation braces each year for a new onslaught from the taxhungry bureaucracy we have developed in Washington. it is well for us to realize that the money appropriated by the Congress must first be raised through the sweat and blood of the Ameriaen workingman. The inconsistency of the New Frontier in piously promoting what it terms social progress while at the same time breaking the back of the taxpayer with these huge spending schemes is indefensible. An outstanding community newspaper of my district. the Southwest Messenger Press. in an editorial this April 20 entitled \"Long Arm.\" discusses the effect of our crushing tax structure and makes the most effective point that reductions in nonessential governmental spending would certainly be in order: LONG AaM Another income tax time has cone and gone. And millions of us feel a sad flatness in the pocketbook. Once the income tax was a rich mans taxpeople of small and moderate earnings A3392 1961 CON( paid little or nothing. But now. as Citizens Public Expenditure Survey observes. \"the long arm of the Internal Revenue Service reaches out to nearly everybody.\" Heres the cold statistical story: Of the total Federal tax. people who earn under $5.000 a year pay 21 percent. The $5.000$10.000 group pays 39 percent. The $10.000$15.000 earners pay 11 percent. The $15.000$50.000 people pay 17 percent. And the real big income group--50.000 and overpays only 12 percent.. This isnt because the rich are favoredincome tax rates reach a top bracket of 91 percent. It simply reflects the fact that there are not enough wealthy people to foot the bill for governmentbut there are millions of individuals in the modest income brackets. So. inevitably. the latter must pay the great bulk of government costs. And they. collectively. would gain the most from reductions in nonessential governmental spending. Hon. A. R. Stout",

First of all. I should say that our Blue CrossBlue Shield program in St. Louis was among the first such plan in the country to make it possible for retired persons over 65 to obtain coverage on an individual basis. It is my understanding that in many areas of the country. A3402 the worker who goes on retirement under social security can no longer obtain insurance coverage from Blue CrossBlue Shield. whether he can afford it or not.

I agree with my colleague from Michigan that certainly the committee ought to find out in any of these cases. and should designate the officer who made the mistake. but to go back now and penalize these men because something has not been done on their part I think compounds the mistake against these men. A committee of Congress is making a mistake. and it may be corrected. I hope that the Committee on the Judiciary will - correct the mistake. However. two mistakes will have been made. These men should receive this pay and not be penalized and have to pay it back to the Government.",

They are now being used by the Government.

He says that the only limit is that if one of them should stay on the payroll for more than a year. that his salary would have to be limited by $15.000. But he said in effect that that would not apply if his services were for only a few days. So. apparently. there is not the great rigidity that we hear about.

Quoting further from this letter from the Deputy Attorney General: This jam could be broken by inaugurating. on a selective basis. raises of $500 to $1.000 a year depending on the experience. ability. and character of the work of the individual. The same would apply to the 29 attorneys now in the $15.800 to $16.500 bracket and the 9 receiving from $16.500 to $17.500. As indicated in my previous letter. only a small percentage of the Department lawyers would be affected by the proposed amendment. We would expect that no more than 100 (including present supergrades) of the Departments 1.014 attorneys (exclusive of those in U.S. attorneys offices) would be receiving compensation in excess of grade 15 salaries at the end of the next 5 years. As for those attorneys now covered by lower Classification Act pay scales. as I stated in my June 23 letter. the compensation of only a relatively small number of attorneys would be affected and in these instances based upon exceptional performance. I think I made it clear in my letter how we would handle their compensation. A lot has been said as to what this bill will do in reference to conflicting interests and the salaries of attorneys in other departments. This is a very simple. a very reasonable. a very excellent chance and opportunity to give the Attorney General the law and the power that he needs to adjust salaries of some 100 or more attorneys now working for him and who will come into the Department so that he can properly do the job that he has stated he wants to do properly. Certainly when he has asked the Congress for this. when he has appeared before the committee. when he has explained it in detail and stated he needs this to properly run his Department. Congress should certainly have enough confidence in him to give him what he wants when it is at a very low cost as far as the overall budget is concerned. It is bound to tremendously aid the Department and thereby aid the American people and will thus enable him to do the excellent job he has promised he will do if given the opportunity by passage of this bill.",

The gentleman from Ohio is not fooling anyone. If the gentleman thinks he is. I may say there are some people here who have a little intelligence. The amazing thing is that all these resolutions were suddenly put down on the agenda of the Rules Committee without anybody being consulted. The committee had a perfect right to do that. but we are capable of evaluating such action and interpreting the state of mind of some of the members of the Rules Committee. The gentleman from Ohio talks about having the House work its will. These rules were before the Rules Committee as a standing committee. they were not bills reported out of a standing committee with a request to the Rules Committee for a rule to bring them before the House. bills that had been considered by a standing committee. So when the gentlemans committee was considering these resolutions to amend the rules of the House. the committee was sitting as a committee that had original jurisdiction over the question. and. of course. the situation exists there that exists in any standing committee. Hundreds of bills. yes. thousands of bills. are referred to our standing committees. but never reported out of committee. The members of the committee vote upon a particular bill as it comes up in executive session. So the situation on these resolutions is entirely different than it was. for example. in the case of the school construction bill last year. That bill passed the House. passed the Senate. but it could not go to conference because there was one objection. and we could not get a resolution out of the Rules Committee to permit that bill to be sent to conference.

Now. why should we wait? We all know what is needed. We can recall the saying attributed to William H. Vanderbilt. the railroad tycoon. When a reporter suggested the publics interest was not protected. he is said to have replied: \"The public be damned.\" That seems to be our attitude at the moment. The real issue is clear. It is the same which has so often troubled the U.S. Supreme Court. It is this: When must the right granted to the individual by the Constitution yield to the welfare of the people? For years. it has been my contention that when the governmentlocal. State. or Federalfound it necessary to limit the income of an enterprise which furnished a necessary public service. the rights of individuals or organizations must yield.

While everyone on a fixed income is a victim of any increase in the cost of living. certainly no segment of our society is more hard hit than are our elderly citizens who are living on their social security benefits. The high cost of medical care. food. clothing. and housing has increased to the point where thousands of our elderly people are finding it impossible to live on their social security payments and the limited amount which they are permitted to earn from outside sources. As a result they have been forced. in many instances. to turn to their relatives and public assistance agencies for help. Mr. Speaker. one of the factors which makes it difficult for our social security beneficiaries to support themselves. is their inability under existing law to earn enough from outside sources to supplement their social security checks. The present limitation in the social security law on outside income is unrealistic and inadequate. It fails to compensate for the cost of living increase we are experiencing. Our social security beneficiaries. Mr. Speaker. are caught between high prices and a legal limitation on the amount of income they may earn from outside sources. I believe it is time for the Congress to do something about this situation and I have. therefore. introduced a bill which will permit social security beneficiaries to earn as much as $2.000 in outside income. This increase will do much to help our older citizens secure enough income to meet the challenge of inflation and maintain an adequate standard of living.",

His service in the House ran from 1912 to 1926. with time out only for military service as a major in World War I. He was first elected to the Senate in 1926. and has served in the Senate ever since. Mr. President. things were much different when Senator HAYDEN first came to Congress. Transportation was a problem. for example. and it took him the better part of a week on the train to reach Washington from Arizona. Now it is a matter of hours by air. The Senate should know also that Senator HAYDENS public life began before he arrived in Congress. It began in 1904. when he was elected a member of the Tempe. Ariz.. Town Council. The town formerly had been called Haydens Ferry. in honor of the Senators father. Before coming to Congress. CARL HAYDEN also served as treasurer of Maricopa County. and had a taste of the rough and tough life of an Arizona sheriff. Mr. President.

With the observance of Lincolns birthday still fresh in our minds. I am reminded of his eloquent Gettysburg statement which is so appropriate at this time: The world will little note nor long remember what we say here. but it can never forget what they did here. True. our Nation and. indeed. the world will never forget that Senator HENNINGS was a fightera fighter who had the respect of his opponents. Born in St. Louis in 1903. Tom HENNINGS graduated from Cornell University and Washington University Law School. He served the people as assistant circuit attorney in St. Louis. as Congressman. as circuit attorney. and as Senator. His entire career in public service was marked by a high degree of independent judgment. The London Times summed up his career in the Senate with this statement: Senator HENNINGS emerged as an acknowledged expert on the Constitution and constitutional law. and fought this and other battles in a number of capacities. including chairman of the Senate Rules Committee and of Judiciary Subcommittees on Constitutional Rights. Juvenile Delinquency. and Federal Penitentiaries. I first met Tom HENNINGS when we were prosecuting attorneys for our home counties in Missouri. It was with pride that I watched his meteoric rise in the Democratic Party and in the Senate of the United States. Therefore. it is with the deepest humility that I accepted my election by the people of Missouri to fill Senator HENNINGS unexpired term. One could speak at length on Tom HENNINGS work in the Senate. But. to me. the high points of his career were his fights in opposition to measures he thought contrary to the Constitution or to the welfare of the people. He could always be depended upon to protect the rights of the people from governmental interference. I know of no higher tribute that can be said of any man. Upon the death of Tom HENNINGS many newspapers throughout our land and abroad spoke of the loss. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that editorials published in the London Times.

Senator HENNINGS was a true public servant and a loyal American. He was devoted to his friends and was loyal to his friends. and he was esteemed by them. Senator HENNINGS possessed the qualities that the Supreme Court of South Carolina said are essential for a good lawyer. First. integrity. Integrity is the heart of character. A man may possess many qualities. but without integrity he is most certainly doomed to failure. Senator HENNINGS was a man of strong integrity. Second. industry. A man may have intregity. and he may have other qualities. but if he is not willing to work he will probably not go very far. Senator HENNINGS was a prodigious worker. Third. knowledge. Senator HENNINGS was a man of broad experience. He was widely read. He could discuss with interest and intelligence almost any subject on the scene today and in past history. He possessed these three essential qualities of a good lawyer to a marked degree. He was an attractive man. He was a great athlete. and possessed a fine physique. He was personable. He attracted people and was attracted to people. Personally I felt many times that his heart was with the South in many matters before the Senate. but. because of his constituency. he felt he must represent them. It was with much regret that I learned of the death of TOM HENNINGS. He was fortunate in having a devoted and loyal and fine wife. who was a great inspiration to him. I know that she has undergone a great deal of suffering in the loss of her fine husband. and she has my deepest sympathy.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I yield to myself all my time. Mr. President. for many years now. I have felt that the Nations pension program for veterans of World War I has not only been inadequate. but has been reduced to little more than a welfare program for men who happened to serve in World War I. The 1959 Congress went further in this direction than it has ever gone before. putting veterans pensions on a sliding scale related inversely to income. In my opinion. that makes it a welfare program. I think the Nations veterans are entitled to better than that. Pensions should not be a part of a welfare program. They should be a form of recognition. of obligation on the part of the Nation. The amendment I offer today is the same as the bill I have introduced before on this subject. It is S. 2985 of the current Congress. It provides a pension for veterans of World War I by establishing as a matter of law that such a veteran shall be considered permanently and totally disabled at age 65. and entitled to pension benefits. The veteran would also be considered permanently and totally disabled for pension purposes if he has been so rated for an aggregate period of 10 years. He would receive a pension of $90 a month. plus a 10 percent Increment for service overseas of at least 30 days during World War I. This proposal is not nearly as generous as many pension proposals for this group have been. In fact. I would favor and vote for a more comprehensive program than this one I am offering. It is not as liberal a measure. for example. as H.R. 3745. in the other body. This is because my bill does not change the existing income limits of $1.800 for a single veteran and $3.000 for a married veteran.",

We also need to keep in mind the moral obligation we owe those men. because. considering every war since World War I. the World War I veterans are the forgotten veterans of America. It is perfectly clear that the World War I veterans have never received the benefits which veterans of other wars have received. including wars before World War I and World War II and the Korean war. When we speak about a pension which is to be given veterans having low income earning. we are talking about pensions which will be used to buy the necessities of life. We are talking about pensions which will be poured immediately into the economic stream of this country. They are going to be used to buy consumer goods and the necessities of life.

I think 5 years is long enough to wait for hearings on any bill. I think the time has come for the Senate to take action on the floor of the Senate on a bill which seeks to do justice to World War I veterans. In the other body. Members signed a discharge petition which came close to bringing H.R. 3745 to the House floor before hearings were obtained on the general subject. I have been advised by friends in the House that the only way the discharge petition was stopped was to take the bill to hearings. but it has bogged down on the House side. There is not much more time for this issue to be considered at this session of Congress. I do not doubt that the opponents of broader pension provisions know this very well. Time is on their side. because time is running out for the veterans of World War I. If the opponents of the pension bill. to do Justice to World War I veterans. stall long enough. wait long enough. the problem will automatically disappear through the death of the veterans themselves. But that is an ugly thought. if we will reflect for a moment upon our moral obligation to those veterans.

Those backing a general pension for World War I veterans are united behind H.R. 3745. which they do not have a chance to get passed at this session. My bill does not go as far as that bill. which substantially raises income limits and excludes many forms of income from the computation of income limits.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have had printed two amendments. which are at the desk. I have offered neither of them. One amendment relates to the engraving by the Bureau of Engraving of the portrait of -the Chief Justice of the: Supreme Court. in accordance with a timehonored custom going back to 1873. I do not feel that this is the kind of measure which should be pressed as an amendment. I feel that the request should properly come from the Bureau of the Budget. following the longstanding tradition in which this has been done for Chief Justices of the Supreme Court. Incidentally. this is a practice which has paid for itself through the purchases of prints of the engraving by the public. I shall refrain from offering the amendment. but I request the Bureau of the Budget to consider the introduction of such an item into the proposed budget for next year. Second. Mr. President. I had printed an amendment with respect to increasing the sum allowed by the committee for the informational media guarantee fund from $1 million to $1.5 million. I am satisfied that such an amendment probably would not carry. I am satisfied also that the committee will approach these discussions in conference with the other body with the utmost fairness. I made a speech this morning in which I pointed out that the big problem in the USIA was that it was altogether too narrowly confined in what we were asking for and in its general design. I said. and I repeat. that I thought powerful Uncle Sam had a pipsqueak voice because we were not asking for all that was needed to do the job commensurate with $50 billion for defense and about $5 billion for foreign aid. But that problem will not be corrected by what I might or might not be able to do on these small amounts. Therefore. I have decided to leave that question to the conference.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I modify my amendment by striking out the date. \"1961\". and inserting \"1962\". so that the words to be inserted will read \"after January 1. 1962\". I believe the consideration of this amendment will not take long. The amendment goes to the provision already adopted by the Senate. an amendment added by the Foreign Relations Committee. in connection with expropriation of American property by other countries. The committee adopted an amendment--which now has been adopted by the Senateproviding that in any case in which the President determines that a nation or political subdivision thereof has expropriated or otherwise seized property of Americans. unless it sets up the proper machinery to accomplish the payment for the property so seized. it cannot obtain any help from our foreignassistance program. until such payment is made. However. the amendment provides for such prohibition in any case hereafter in which the President determines that a nation or political subdivision thereof has expropriated such property. I propose to have the language read \"has expropriated after January 1. 1962\"-in other words. last January. There are several reasons for this amendment. Today. three expropriations which are going on in the world have taken place since January 1. 1962two in Brazil. and one in Ceylon. Another one is now proposed in Burma. and today there are in the legislatures of almost all the Latin American States bills proposing the expropriation of American property of various kinds. If we do not do something to stop that kind of nonsense. or to see that payment is made for property when it is seized. we shall see a wave of expropriations of property of Americans going throughout the world like a prairie fire. The amendment which the committee adopted is not adequate. I had an amendment that I liked better. I think it was a little tighter. But I am not quarreling at this time with the general purpose of the amendment adopted by the committee. I first want to put in the RECORD the decree of expropriation of the Communist dictatorship of Cuba. which was posted July 7. 1960. I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the RECORD at this point in my remarks.",

Sovereign nations have a right to do that. but I do not think the Congress of the United States has any right to vote funds. loans. and gifts to be given to a country that deliberately expropriates American taxpayers property and does not immediately pay for it in full. To me the situation is ridiculous. Unless it is stopped. American private enterprise will not invest in many of these countries. and we as legislators have no right to spend the American taxpayers money in those countries. I agree with the able Senator from Iowa that there will be nothing but chaos. both in this country and other countries. unless we stop expropriation through such an amendment as the committee offered. plus the Senators amendment to that amendment. making the provision retroactive for a couple of years.

I wish to say at the beginning of my remarks. as I have told the able Senator from Iowa. I am willing to take the amendment to conference. but I wish to make a few very brief remarks in regard to it. The Senator from Iowa has made the record. and it is a record on which all of us can agree. Every member of the committee was greatly concerned over the question of expropriation. We feared. as the Senator from Iowa pointed out. that there might be a wave of expropriations. We recognize. as was pointed out by the Senator from Indiana and by the Senator from Iowa. that every sovereign nation has the right of expropriation. We do not dispute that. However. under international law and under good practice there should be adequate compensation. \"Adequate compensation\" carries with it. by implication. timely compensation as well as sufficiency of compensation. I do not believe there was any other provision in the bill on which we worked harder than we worked on this particular provision. The Senator from Iowa was most helpful and most instrumental in working out an amendment which was accepted by the committee as a whole and I think was fairly satisfactory to the committee as a whole. When the Senator from Iowa offered his original amendment. it had a much earlier date. In fact. it would have applied to any expropriation which had taken place in the past or which might take place in the future. Now the Senator has pinned the date down to exactly January 1. 1962. which would cover the most recent acts of expropriation. I do not wish to bind myself to the exact language. I think the Senator from Iowa understands that. Of course. the Senator from Iowa will be one of the conferees when the bill goes to conference. This language will give us ample latitude for discussion in the conference committee. for arriving at a suitable arrangement. For that reason I am willing to take the amendment to conference. I am ready to yield back the remainder of my time.",

The amendment provides \"and no other provision of this act shall be construed to authorize the President to waive the provisions of this subsection.\" I sincerely believe that the adoption of the amendment would be of great service to the President and to the administration in connection with the expropriation matters. because the pressures put on the Executive to waive provisions of the law. under the argument that it is in the national interest to do so in this case or in that case. are very great indeed.

It is designed to secure the improvement. if possible. of the plans for economic development of the countries we help. and also to secure the participation of other countries in programs of aid to the countries we help. In February 1959. the then Senator Kennedy and I introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution 11. That resolution asked that the U.S. Government invite friendly democratic nations to join with the United States. and to consult with countries in south Asia for the purpose of determining two things: First. whether a better program of economic development could be formulated. second. whether other countries could be persuaded to join the United States in financing such a program. That resolution was passed by the Senate on September 10. 1959. The State Department acted upon the resolution. It requested the help of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The World Bank obtained the cooperation of Mr. Hermann J. Abs of Frankfurt. Germany. Sir Oliver Franks of England. and Mr. Allen Sproul. former chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Those three men went to south Asia. to India. and Pakistan. They consulted with the governments of those countries. returned. and made their recommendations. I think that the resolution which the then Senator Kennedy and I introduced encouraged a consortium composed of countries such as Western Germany. the United Kingdom. Japan. Canada. and France. which are now helping to finance the economic development of India and Pakistan. The amendment I have offered today follows the language and purposes of the resolution the Senate adopted in 1959. It would urge the President. where he thought it feasible. to invite other countries to join with the United States in consulting with the countries we are helping. and in exploring the possibilities of joining with us in two projects: First. to provide better plans for the economic development of these countries. and second. to help to provide the funds for their economic development. The method worked in the case of India and Pakistan. I think it could be used effectively in the case of other countries we aid.",

I recall being in Vienna last September at the meeting of the World Bank and its subsidiary organizations. I recall the brilliant speech made at the time of his retirement by Robert L. Garner on the question of foreign aid. I recall in the month of October hearing the President of the World Bank. Mr. Eugene Black. make a very brilliant speech on the subject in New York after a big dinner at the Waldorf. The one point that stood out in the remarks of both of those men. in the light of their long experience in lending money around the world to promote the welfare of countries. was that the quality of the loan is the important consideration. Their feeling was that we spent or lent too much money on projects in which the net result is not clearly seen. and the loan fails to accomplish the purpose for which it was originally intended. So I compliment the Senator on bringing out that point. The question in my mind regarding the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky is in respect to what sort of advisory committee the Senator has in mind. The Senator has said that the programs would be reviewed by an advisory committee appointed by the President. Does he mean committees within the Government or outside authorities? Could we develop the Senators view as to what he means by an advisory committee?",

Our population is increasing. and the demand for foodstuffs is increasing. It is good. common horsesense for Congress to ask the Secretary of Agriculture. who has all the facts concerning this subject. to come forth with a plan to phase out the Governments control of agriculture over a period of 4 to 6 years. I agree we cannot phase it out in 1 year or 2 years. It seems to me that both Congress and the administration. whether it be a Democratic or a Republican administration. should give a great deal of thought to this subject. I know the farmers are doing it. I call attention to the fact that farm products that are at the moment not under controls are doing well. One of the troubles at the moment is that we have thrown the whole farm economy completely out of gear. We have helped here and hurt there. For that reason I am happy to support the amendment. and I am happy to be a coauthor of it. because I think we ought to start giving some real attention to phasing the program out over a period of years in a way that will not hurt anyone.

Thus the people of America are being denied and are denying themselves the stirring experience of visiting these truly fantastic and aweinspiring areas.

I have reviewed the facts about which the proposed joint resolution treats. I find present an incredible mixup or failure of understanding or communication between the Federal Bureau of Roads and the State of Massachusetts. However. the relief sought jointly by the Senators from Massachusetts does not in fact set a precedent for permitting a State to violate the maximum standards set in the act. I should like to point out that the joint resolution provides not only that the apportionment may be made. but it also provides that the money may not be obligated or expended so long as the State of Massachusetts has a legal maximum load limit above the maximum limits set by Federal law.

We had theretofore proceeded to build highways sufficient to carry loads of a given dimension. only to have those limits increased. thereby making the highways inadequate. With the initiation of this vast highway program. on a bipartisan basis. costing many billions of dollars. Congress determined that it would be in the national interest and also in the interest of the trucking industry to establish uniform national standards and then to construct highways sufficient to accommodate traffic under such standards. This decision having been made. we are proceeding now to build highways to accommodate traffic with these maximum limits now provided in law. Therefore I am sure both Senators from Massachusetts and other Members of the Senate also will see how fallacious it would be now to build highways to carry certain weight limits and then to allow exceptions to be made which would render the highways. which are not even completed. already inadequate even before completion. So it is with this understanding that I will not interpose an objection.",

House Joint Resolution 472 is a resolution which calls for emergency action. The Massachusetts Legislature in June of this year passed a law increasing the tonnage of trucks on the Interstate Highways from 60.000 to 73.000 pounds. The Bureau of Public Roads has advised the State and the attorney general of Massachusetts agrees that this Massachusetts act is in violation with Federal law. The result of this is that Massachusetts will be disqualified from receiving its apportionment of Federal Interstate Highway funds for the fiscal year 1963 unless the law is corrected. Unfortunately. the Massachusetts Legislature has convened for this year and will not meet again until January of 1962. I am. therefore. asking that this joint resolution be adopted so that the Massachusetts Legislature will be able to correct this oversight in its regular session.

It is still the foundation of the wildlife laws of the Old Dominion. In 1926. the administration of commercial fishing was divorced from fresh water fishing and upland game. the latter two being put under a game commission. consisting of five members. Governor HARRY F. BYRD appointed ROBERTSON as the first chairman of that new commission. in which capacity he served for the next 6 years. In 1934. Senator ROBERTSON organized in the House of Representatives the Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation. on which he served as chairman for the next 12 years. That committee sponsored the Duck Stamp Act for the protection of migratory birds. the PittmanRobertson Act. giving Federal aid to States for wildlife conservation. the Coordination Act. which was designed to protect wildlife interests in all water impoundments by the Army Engineers. the development of hunting and recreational areas In the national forests. the construction on farm ponds by the Civilian Conservation Corps and later by the Soil Conservation Service. and so forth.

The bill provides that this aid shall only be given to those transportation systems which are operated by the Government. It is interesting to note that in the country there are 1.272 local trahsportation systems. and that of the 1.272. 60 are operated by the Government. As I said a moment ago. the aid will go only to governmentally operated transportation systems. That brings us to the interesting question of what will eventually happen to the privately operated systems if it is declared that to get Federal aid they must be publicly or governmentally owned. cvII1003 I submit that the proposal means the eventual conversion of all transportation. systems from private into governmental operations. Perhaps it is in accord with the trend of the times. Perhaps it conforms with the judgment of many in high places of public office. that the private operations of our railroads and mass transportation systems back home ought to be destroyed and converted into governmentally owned operations. I cannot subscribe to that philosophy. I cannot dismiss from my mind that the great abundance which we have in this country. especially when compared with the paucity of the economic strength around the world in Communist and Socialist countries. would not justify any course of action which would change our system. The bill. if passed. means the socialization of the local transportation systems throughout the country. Sixty of these 1.272 systems are operated by Government. These 60. in the buying of equipment and in the buying of roadbeds. would receive from the Federal Government $2 for every dollar they spent.",

The Senator from New York has just spoken about a tax cut. How wonderful it would be if we could prudently give the people of our country a tax cut. However. if we are to give them a tax cut. we will not be able to do it if the Government increasingly enters into subsidization.

The article makes clear that \"the economicpolitical advantages that the Soviets derive from their petroleum exports were considerable.\" The article. written by Ferdinand F.

What the article does not mention is the action being taken by the United States to meet this new Soviet economic threat. The omission is undoubtedly made for a very good reason. So far the United States has done next to nothing. Quite the contrary. in fact. the Department of Justice. through a rigid interpretation of conflictofinterest regulations. has made it impossible even for the oil companies represented in the National Petroleum Council to prepare a factual report on the problem.

I am very pleased that the President has issued an Executive order requiring submission to the Attorney General of all instances of identical bids of more than $10.000 to a Government agency. I certainly hope that all of this material will be made available to the Congress. and other interested public officials. upon request. The Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly has been looking Into this problem for a number of years. and has come up with many instancestoo manywhere sealed bids amounting to very large sums of money have been identical down to onethousandth of a penny. Since the bids are supposed to be arrived at in secret. it seems a startling coincidence that this should occur so frequently. I am hopeful that when the spotlight of publicity is turned on identical bidding. their frequency will lessen. Should this happen. it will help to strengthen the competitive character of the American economy. which Is so essential to our freeenterprise system. The Executive order will also be useful in providing leads to cases of price fixing. However. additional action may be required. For example. the subcommittee. In its current investigation of the electrical manufacturing industry. has come up against a conspiratorial pattern of agreement by companies to take turns in the submission of low bids. One of these conspiracies was known as the \"phase of the moon.\" As a result of these hearings. the question of corrective legislation will be considered by the subcommittee. It may well be that the subcommittee will find it necessary to draw up legislation to deal specifically with price fixing and bid rigging.",

The duty of committees of both Houses to develop pertinent facts is inescapable. The integrity of a committee. seeking facts from which to legislate. should be stoutly defended. Madam President. Walter Reuther assailed me for my endeavor to secure facts relating to a major legislative matter. His willingness to distort. his effort to conceal. and his characteristic abuse of persons not like minded. is an affront to this body. The incident that I speak of occurred in connection with the consideration by the Committee on Finance of the Senate of H.R. 4806. known as the temporary unemployment compensation extension. on Thursday. March 9. 1961. All the facts relating to our unemployment problem. such as the extent of the unemployment. its duration. the location of the areas where the problem is the most serious and the manner in which the unemployment statistics are gathered are certainly facts which the Congress should have. A committee would be derelict in its duty. and unfair to the unemployed and the public generally if it did not seek all of the facts available. The estimates of the number of unemployed each month are made by a sampling that takes place in a week occurring in the middle of the month. This week in which the samples are taken and from which the estimates are made of the number of unemployed is known as the count week. or sometimes the survey week. The count or sample is taken by the Bureau of the Census. Madam President. I now wish to quote from the hearings of the Finance Committee on this measure beginning near the middle of page 107 with the recognition by the chairman of the Senator from Utah and continuing to the bottom of page 110: Senator BENNETT. Mr. Chairman. before we leave this particular area. there are a couple of questions I would like to ask. if I may.",

    "speech": "Madam President. by Mr. Reuthers own words in his own press release. he did request the automobile companies to make layoffs to shut down the plant. His press release was published in the papers. By Mr. Reuthers own press release. the newspaper reports about which I inquired were true. The second part of the question was. \"If such layoffs were requested could they be covered in the count week?\" Here again. the facts speak for themselves. We do not need to rely upon conjecture or opinion. Secretary Goldbergs statement found on page 110 of the hearings carries this significant statement: These data give evidence since midJanuary of a regular pattern of layoffs 1 week followed by recalls the following week. In keeping with this pattern. initial claims during the week ending February 18. a census survey week. show an increase. followed by a decline during the following week. I wish to be fair to Secretary Goldberg. He went on to say: The fact that the rise occurred during the census week may be regarded as coincidental. The timing of the census survey simply appears to have coincided with this regular pattern of alternating weeks of layoffs and recalls. There then appears in the record a table on Michigans unemployment submitted by Secretary Goldberg. It shows that for the week ending February 18. the total insured unemployment in Michigan was 244.758. This was the count week. or. as has been referred to by the Secretary. the census survey week. In the week before that. which ended on February 11. Michigan has only 201.686 insured unemployed. and in the week that followed. that is. the week ended February 25. the number dropped back to 210.300. The number of insured unemployed for the week ending February 18. 1961. for the entire Nation increased by 31.656. The increase for Michigan alone was 43.072. Had Michigans insured unemployed stayed either at the figure that it was for the week prior to the count week or what it was in the week that followed the count week the total number of insured unemployed for the week in February used as the survey week or count week would have actually dropped instead of having been increased.",

He did what the newspapers said he did. He did what the Senator from Nebraska inquired about. Madam President. referring once again to my question put by Senator BENNETT which was: Mr. Secretary. are the reports in the papers true that Mr. Walter Reuther requested the automobile industry to make layoffs in the middle of last month which would be covered in this count week? The answer to that question is yes. Mr. Reuther did request a layoff or a closing of the plant. The plants did close. It did occur in the week that the census survey of the unemployed is made. It did cause an increase in the number of insured unemployed persons in Michigan. in the absence of which increase the national figure would have declined Instead of going up. The month that we have been talking about is the month of February of this year. Let us take a look at the month of March. The count week or the census survey week. whichever one may choose to call it. was the week ending March 18th. Was there a shutdown of the automobile plants where Mr. Reuthers workers are employed?

Undoubtedly stock options. even in reasonably limited amounts. are incentives. but one wonders about the \"added incentive\" to an officer who already possesses enormous stockholdings in the company and who. in addition. is the beneficiary of an unusually large salary. It was in this context that I cited Mr. Watsons compensation of $300.000 per annum and his enormous personal holdings of IBM stock. of which he can be justifiably proud. Mr. Watson makes it perfectly plain that insofar as he is concerned. stock options are a matter of compensation. He says: On the other hand. it has never seemed to me that my holdings in IBM should penalize me from being treated in the same way as other executives throughout American business. Apparently. Senator GORE would like to have stock options and perhaps even salary related to the financial means of the individual. Personally.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing a bill to extend the benefits of the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Act to certain retired employees entitled to deferred annuity. During the last Congress we enacted Public Law 86724. and to be eligible for benefits under this law. an employee must have retired on an immediate annuity after at least 12 years of service. or for disability. An immediate annuity is one which begins to accrue no later than 1 month after the date of the employees separation. To cite one example of the inequity of this law. one individual in my district left Government employment on October 19. 1956. at the age of 61. after 25 years. 7 months. and 4 days of service. Under the provisions of the Retirement Act in effect at that time. however. he was not eligible to begin receiving an annuity until he reached age 62. His annuity commenced on August 1. 1957. the 1st day of the month following his 62d birthday. Since this was more than 1 month after the date of his separation. his annuity was a deferred annuity. and he therefore is not eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Act. Public Law 86724 imposes the immediate annuity requirement by incorporating the same eligibility requirements for persons who retired before July 1. A681 Febru iy 2 1960. as were spelled out in Public Law 86382--the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959for employees retiring after July 1. 1960. Such employees. must. among other conditions. retire on an immediate annuity in order to continue after retirement the health benefits protection they had as employees. It is the purpose of my bill to correct this inequity. and I strongly urge that serious consideration be given to the passage of this corrective legislation. New Farm Leaders for a New Era",

[From the Los Angeles Examiner. Nov. 30. 1960] FBI ScoREs AGAIN Famous though the FBI is in all its activities. no other achievement gets such grateful and unanimous public approval as the solving of a kidnaping and the arrest of the kidnapers. A dramatic example has just been enacted In southern California. Five suspects have been caught with much of the $200.000 ransom money paid in the Anthony Alessio abduction. The victim has been restored uninjured to his family after a shocking experience. Kidnaping is a most repugnant crime. bringing terror and. in all too many instances. death to the immediate victims as well as agony to the victims families. Because of the general revulsion and also because of a great increase in the number of ranson kidnapings. authority was given under the Lindbergh law more than 25 years ago for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to aid the local authorities or to take over these cases entirely. There has been no finer performance in all criminal history than the record the FBI has made. Since the Lindbergh law there 1have been 517 kidnap cases handled by the FBI. And 515 of these have been solved through superior training. hard work and thorough organization. Of all the 517 kidnapings only 2 remain unsolved and you well know the FBI is working unceasingly on these. The great bureau of investigation built by J. Edgar Hoover has made this type of crime certain to be without profit and certain to result in arrest and punishment that ofttimes is death. Because of its almost unbelievable record we salute the FBI for a tremendous job excellently done. [From the Inglewood (Calif.) Daily News. Nov. 80. 1960]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the administrations action in sending Federal marshals into Alabama warrants our complete support. Federal officers were sent to insure the maintenance and enforcement of Federal law. Under the circumstances no other choice could be made. The administration has stated that an 1871 law served as the legal basis for its action. That Federal statute authorizes the President to take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress. in a State. any insurrection or domestic violence. The Presidents action was prompted by patent denials of the rights of citizens to travel freely and without harm. State and local authorities were apparently unwilling or unable to protect those rights. I stand firmly in support of the action taken by the Federal Government to meet this disgraceful situation. It is now doubly clear. however. that we must have new legislation arming the Attorney General with the legal tools necessary to initiate court actions where civil rights have been violated. There is. under existing law. legal basis to prevent obstruction of interstate commerce. but the Federal Government does not have the sanctions which it ought to have in order to prevent and to punish willful denials of the right of peaceful assembly. or of free and equal access to publicly supported institutions. or other constitutionally protected rights not necessarily tied to interstate commerce. Some time ago I introduced legislation which would authorize the Attorney General to initiate civil injunctive proceedings against persons who willfully and discriminatorily deprive any person or groups of persons of their right to the equal protection of the laws. Such proceedings could likewise prevent hindrances to Federal officials from carrying out orders of the court. There must be no doubt or equivocation. as there is now. about the authority of the Federal Government with respect to all constitutionally protected rights. As a member of the House Judiciary Committee. I must again request legislative action. Legislation is long overdue and we have a right to expect that the administration will support it. consistent with its platform.",

I am happy to join with millions of wellwishers in this country and abroad to extend felicitations and warmest greetings to our Chief Executive. With it go my sincerest wishes that the year ahead may prove to be a year of great achievement for him and for our Nation. It is said that every period of crisis in the Nations history brings forth its men of great vision and ability. We are fortunate indeed to have a man of the vision and stature of President Kennedy to lead our people at this crucial period in human affairs. I feel certain that under his leadership and guidance we can look forward to the future with courage and determination that our national goals will be achieved. On the eve of his departure for Europe. where he is to meet with the great French statesman General de Gaulle. with Soviet Premier Khrushchev and others. we wish him godspeed and success in his endeavors in behalf of world peace. Together with these wishes. go our assurances that the American people are united behind him and fully support him in these efforts. Millions in this country will be praying for his success. It is perhaps coincidental. but nevertheless momentous. that this mission to Europe should begin on his 44th birthday. Not many men in all of history. in all nations. have reached the pinnacle of leadership of a great nation at the age of 44. President Kennedy has emerged on the world scene as the leader of the greatest and the most powerful nation of all times at this relatively young age. and that is due to his great leadership. his ability. his understanding of world problems. and his unceasing desire to make this world a safer and a happier place for all mankind. May the good Lord bless him and his family with many years of good health. May we be privileged to benefit of his able leadership and wise counsel in the years ahead. and may he succeed in leading our Nation from strength to strength.

I am pleased to join in support of the resolution to establish a Special House Committee on Captive Nations. which is being sponsored by our distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania. the Honorable DANIEL J. FLOOD. The resolution is now pending before the House Rules Committee. which held hearings on it recently. I trust the committee will act speedily and favorably on the measure. I believe that it is in our national interest to provide every possible help and moral encouragement to the captive nations in their struggle to regain their national freedom. independence. and human dignity. We must give heart to these enslaved peoples by showing that they have not been forgotten during this black period in world affairs when they are enduring great mental and physical suffering. We must also provide all possible hope to them for their future survival. as nations and as individuals. so that they can reestablish and rehabilitate their national life and culture. The peoples of the captive nations are today silenced peoples. unable to speak their minds. unable to practice their religious beliefs. and unable to live as free human beings. Their indomitable will for freedom. however. has not been crushed. They may be silent and grim today. but they are waiting patiently and hopefully for tomorrow. This patience and hope must be kept alive under all circumstances. To give up hope. to lose courage. means to lose everything. The captive nations constitute a great symbol of mankinds struggle against its most ruthless enemy. international communism. which Is seeking to subjugate and enslave all of humanity. By encouraging and aiding the captive nations to continue their gallant struggle in the face of the most difficult odds. we are maintaining and building up a great reservoir of dissatisfaction and resentment within the iron curtain countries which may some day be of invaluable help to the free world. The creation of a committee as advocated in House Resolution 211 would render great assistance to the captive nations and would serve as a powerful weapon in our hands against communism.

Representatives of the Texas users of bracero labor have been in Washington this week in connection with the consideration of the pending legislation. I have conferred at length with members of the group. They are familiar with the content of this conference report. They feel that the conference report is so restrictive. that they cannot successfully continue to use braceros as they have in the past. and they have expressed to me the feeling that they would rather have no bill at all than to have the bill in the conference report. which is before us here today. I think this statement as to the users would probably give some aid and comfort to people who live in cities and who do not really understand farm labor problems and who feel that farm labor is being exploited by this legislation. Mr. Speaker. farm labor is not being exploited by this legislation and. certainly. the restrictions here would make it all the more true that domestic workers would not be discriminated against or thrown out of employment. This legislation is unsatisfactory because it is too restrictive on farmers. Under the circumstances it might be better to abandon the whole idea and try another approach to this problem at a later date. It may be that some of us will feel compelled in view of the wishes of our growers to vote against the entire conference report.

Congress ought to pass legislation to permit these young people to have gainful employment in our parks. in our forests. on our public lands and our State and national public domain. We can build good bodies. We can enlighten minds. We can refresh the spirit. We can conserve natural resources. We can do it for a very modest sum. The entire program about which we are talking would not cost as much as one Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier. which has been made subject to certain allegations. In other words. for half of the cost of an aircraft carrier we can make it possible for 50.000 or more young men to have gainful employment in the parks and forests. building their bodies and building America. I cannot understand what is wrong with the social values in this country. to cause us to wait so long to do something about this problem.

As we read Reorganization Plan No. 1. the Securities and Exchange Commission could delegate its rulemaking power to a Commissioner. to an employee. or to an employee board. Under its rulemakIng authority. the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted sound and reasonable minimum capital requirements which apply to more than 6.000 brokerdealers. A revision of these requirements could seriously restrict the ability of brokerdealersand even the entire securities industryto continue to serve the investing public effectively. The Commission has other vast powers. Under section 19 of the 1934 act the Commission has power to suspend or withdraw the registration of an exchange. to suspend trading in securities. and to revise the rules of exchanges in many important areas. Furthermore. section 15(b) of the 1934 act gives the Commission power to put a brokerdealer out of business by revoking his registration. In our view the Commission should not be permitted to delegate to anyone its legislative powers or its lifeanddeath authority over so important a segment of our economy. I close the quotation at that point. Does the Senator see how this Congress. which so carefully has delegated the powers to a bipartisan Commission. consisting of several well selected persons. could legislate a provision under which any of these importantthese \"life and death\"-powers could be delegated by the whole of that Commission to a humble employee?",

I feel that there is a major inconsistency in this bill. to wit: On page 7 of the report it states under paragraph 2(c) that the construction will be economical and it will not be elaborate or of extravagant design or materials. This presumes. Mr. Chairman. that neither shall there be an expenditure for elaborate or extravagant labor costs. Yet page 14. section 121 of the report states that \"before making a loan or grant the Commissioner will obtain assurances that the laborers and mechanics employed by contractors--and subcontractorsin working on a project will be paid wages at rates as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the DavisBacon Act.\" The history of that act in my State of Missouriespecially in rural areas--has been that it has artificially increased labor costs on public works projects by imposing wage scales in metropolitan areas on smaller communities where such construction is planned or instituted. Undoubtedly. this will increase construction costs and seems directly contrary to the \"economy\" statement on page 7. It would seem that \"wage standards.\" should be \"prevailing wages.\" in individual areas with local determinations based on normal bargaining between employer and the union representatives without thirdparty interference. on the part of the Government. The Missouri prevailing wage law had a drastic effect on local school construction and caused definite increases to the taxpayers for such construction. thereby causing a limited amount of funds to construct \"less building.\" The Federal law generally tends to be even more arbitrary than the State law. In any event. I feel that there should be an effort by all of the Congress to strike out part C establishing labor standards. including section 121 (a) and (b) on page 23 of this bill.",

Chairman HALEYS statement points up some of the significant problems facing Congress and the Departments of the Interior and Health. Education. and Welfare in administering the affairs of the 380.000 Indians presently under Federal jurisdiction. Within a few weeks the House will be asked to approve the budget for the Indian program for fiscal 1963. I wish to bring t the attention of the Members of Congress some pertinent data relative to the cost and scope of the program with which we on the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs concern ourselves in forwarding legislation to the House for consideration. In this respect. Mr. Speaker. I want to comment on the manner in which Chairman HALEY handles Indian legislation. No piece of Indian legislation is either too large or too small for Mr. HALEY. He studies each bill and proposal with skill and patience. He is firm. yet fair. with the Indians and their spokesmen as they present their testimony to the subcommittee. and he is generous with his time when they call at his office to discuss their problems. This Is especially commendable for a Member of Congress who has fewer than 100 Indians in his district. We are indeed fortunate that Mr. Haley continues year after year as subcommittee chairman. Mr. Speaker. our Indian population is increasing more rapidly than other segments of our population. Their needs are increasing proportionately. The cost of our Indian program is mounting year by year. The combined budget request for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Division of Indian Health for fiscal 1963 is $262 million. This represents an expenditure of approximately $700 on behalf of every Indian man. woman. and child. I seriously doubt that we are receiving full value from our expenditures. It is time that Congress and the Federal authorities sit down together and arrive at an overall policy that is more in keeping with present day needs than the one we have been working with during the past 30 years.",

Initially 38.000 manufacturers with 50.000 plants are going to be harassed by questionnaires. crusaders. and just plain meddlers. This directive requires manufacturers employing 50 or more people and holding Government contracts worth $50.000 or more with the Federal Government to file a detailed report on what they are doing about employment discrimination and how many minority group members they employ. As a part of the program. the Government can terminate a contract if willful noncompliance is found. recommend criminal prosecution. publish the names of manufacturers or unions that fail to comply and recommend that Government agencies not do business with those firms failing to comply.

The Committee on Education and Labor. under the chairmanship of the Honorable ADAM C.

Both writers were to be published uncensored. Neither the Chicago Tribune nor anyone else has had any answer from Izvestia. It is a matter that I hope Mr. Alexei Adzhubei. the editor of Izvestia. will clear up during his present visit to Washington. The Chicago Tribune quite properly raises the question whether the Soviet Government. which controls Izvestia and all other means of communications in the Soviet Union. is afraid to let the Russian people read anything but the Kremlins dogma. Mr. Adzhubei has an excellent opportunity to demonstrate to the world just how sincere he is in advocating better understanding between East and West. by announcingas editor of Izvestiaan acceptance of the Tribune invitation. Any effort by Mr. Adzhubei to delay a decision on the pretext that he must further consult with his advisers in Russia must lead us to the obvious conclusion that editors of the Soviet press have little. if anything. to say about the management of their publications in Russia. Once this assumption is forced upon us by Mr. Adzhubeis continued silence. then we must properly draw the final conclusion that our Government is wastlug Its time in extending any special courtesies to this Soviet visitor because he is not free to report his observations in the Russian publication he serves as editor. regardless of what he might say to the contrary in this country.

With respect to the question of whether we should or can have an incentive tax cut. that is an especially pertinent question. The Finance Committee has been considering a socalled tax reform bill which would have some effect on the tax structure. The socalled investment credit is designed to do that. I do not believe the proposed measure would do it very well. Many people in the business community do not think so. An announcement was made by the President that corporation income taxes will be reduced by $11/2 billion because depreciation allowances will be increased. It will be far easier for business to depreciate a plant and use those depreciation funds to acquire machinery and equipment. That. too. should provide an incentive tax cut in that sense. But I think the kind of tax cut that has been generally discusseda tax cut of 4 percentage points for individuals and 4 percentage points for corporationswould not. in my judgment. be the kind of incentive tax cut to which the Senator from New York is referring.

We can bring about a materially greater increase in Government buying if we change the fundamental formula by which depreciation is ascertained. which. incidentally. would also have a tendency to bring taxes down by perhaps another $1 billion in a very good area. The other point I had in mind is that provision would be made for corporations. Perhaps it would be as little as two points. The other point is that a measure should eliminate all taxes on people who axe earning less than $2.000. It is fantastic that people earning less than $2.000 still pay a tax. which results in an income to the Government of about $500 million. Also. we should do something about those in the very high brackets. There should be a reduction from a rate of 91 percent to 65 percent. It seems to me that what we are shooting forand I think it would be wonderful if we could get itis a measure of agreement between thoughtful people like the Senator from Wisconsin. perhaps myself. and others who have spoken on the subject on an incentive tax cut which would be accepted as an incentive.

Of course. there would have to be certain reasonable limitations on it. But I believe it would be to the advantage of the economy of our country and to the advantage of government in the long run to have a much freer depreciation arrangement than is provided for even under the new arrangement.",

It would be the first time that business would be enabled to depreciate more than 100 percent. That would be true even with the Long amendment. which would decrease the proportion of assets that could be depreciated from 100 percent to 93 percent That would be the first loophole. the first opening to enable a business to depreciate not 100 percent. but more than 100 percent. I think that this would be a serious technical mistake for us to make. Once we drive that kind of loophole into the tax laws. it could begin to spread out. as the depletion allowance has done. We would diminish the force of our revenue system and make mandatory the very high rates which are a drag on economy.",

I. as is true of many other Americans. am deeply concerned with the ruthless display of naked power in the sovereign State of Mississippi. I have a suggestion to make in connection with this situation. and any similar situations which might arise in the future. It seems to me that under the Constitution. article III. section 2. the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in but two instances and has no appellate jurisdiction except such as given it by the Congress on the terms that Congress sees fit to give it. That being the case. I recommend to the thoughtful consideration of my colleagues passage of an act of Congress. or if need be. a constitutional amendment which would provide in substance that whenever the Supreme Court of the United States decides a case in which the Constitution of the United States is drawn into question and the consequences of which will have a serious impact upon the people of a sovereign State. or when the domestic tranquillity is liable to be disrupted and our foreign relations embarrassed. that such opinions be advisory only and shall be enforced as law by the Executive only after an appropriate act passed by the Congress of the United States. I am not one who would undermine the Federal judicial system but as a thoughtful American. I cannot help but see the effect of \"judgemade\" law. not only on our economic life but on our religious life. I dread a judicial oligarchy as much as I dread any other form of tyranny. I think it is a great mistake for Americans to accept as a verity everything that the Supreme Court says merely because it is the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is wrong. was manifestly wrong in the school prayer case. and it has been wrong in many other instances. Indeed. it has reversed Itself on many occasions. There should be some check on their mistakes the same as there is a check on the executive and legislative power. I offer this as a suggestion. I hope that some day it will be adopted and through its adoption promote a greater unity among our people. insure our domestic tranquillity. and improve our Image abroad among foreign nations.",

An efficient. adaptable. mobile. and spirited Reserve Force is vital to our ability to meet crises in any part of the world. A fine illustration of all that we look and hope for in Reserve Forces. I believe. is the 452d Troop Carrier Wing at March Air Force Base in Riverside. Calif. For the second consecutive year. the unit has won first place in the annual Continental Air Command Reserve Troop Carrier competition at the Ellington Air Force Base in Texas. Entered in this years competition were the 3 best crews of each of the 15 Reserve wings throughout the United States. Each wing competed in three eventsthe first. a threeaircraft formation paratrooper drop. the second. a twoaircraft night navigational bundle drop. and the third. a twoaircraft lowlevel heavy equipment drop. This competition was designed to provide added recognition for the Air Force Reserve program. the professionalism of its personnel and provenready nowcapability to perform its wartime mission. The competition was scored in the most minute details such as takeoff times computed in seconds. landing times measured in seconds. maintenance of altitudes and assigned airspeeds. accuracy of the drops and rigging of the loads. On the basis of these results. the 452d has established itself as the outstanding troop carrier wing in the Reserve program under the Continental Command. In addition to the wing victory at Ellington. a 452d crew placed third in the Air Force Association competition at Las Vegas. This showing has given the crew recognition as the third best troop carrier crew in the United States and the Reserve program. I would like to take this occasion to publicly commend and congratulate Col. Earl 0. Anderson. the competition team captain and 452d wing commander. and his Reserve unit for their very fine performance and record. Being a flyer myself. I take special interest in this units activities. Being a Californian. I take special pride in knowing that my State is being so well represented in national Air Force competition. And being an American. I am heartened to know that this crack flying unit is prepared and ready to face any crisis that might develop anywhere in the world at any time.",

I pointed out that even though the appeal of the State of Mississippi was pending in the Supreme Court. the State of Mississippi had not been given an opportunity to argue the matter in open court. to have the Justices meet around the conference table to consider and discuss the case among themselves and render a decision. A highly objective approach to the entire subject is taken by the distinguished columnist. Mr. Arthur Krock. in the October 2 issue of the New York Times. Mr. Krocks statement is factually correct and is a fine commentary concerning the disposition of the Court to push the case through before rendering an actual judgment of their own.

The one major change in the substitute amendment from the main bill appears on page 5 of the bill. The major change is that there is included in the bill a prohibition against the labor unions or organizations that might attempt to coerce or influence or bargain an employer to violate the provisions of this act. Up to this point. it was the employer that was liable. But it is thought that. perhaps. in his bargaining activities between labor management and unions. there might come a point where because of the insistence of a labor union. he might be obliged to r1962 violate the law as it applies to discrimination regarding the sexes. As I said. during the debate. organized labor is in favor of this amendment. They are willing to be placed in this bill and to be subject to its penalties. if they are involved in any violation. As a matter of fact. as the gentleman pointed out during the debate. this will once and for all make it a labormanagement joint sponsorship on this bill for equal or comparable pay for comparable work and comparable skills. The remaining amendments are merely perfecting amendments. at the bottom of page 4. It is the sense of this bill that if there is a difference in the wage scale between the sexes that that difference would be resolved and the act would only apply in the very place where these people of opposite sexes are working. It does not establish a minimumn wage. It is not industrywide nor areawide. If. in a factory on A Street. a man is being paid 60 cents an hour and a woman is being paid 50 cents an hour in that plant. this law would apply and the wages or pay would be equalized.

I would like to point out that in the report on this bill. in the testimony given by the very distinguished Assistant Secretary of Labor. the Honorable Esther Peterson. she said: The absence of an equal pay clause in a union contract does not necessarily mean that pay is not equal. some contracts specify one rate for the job. and no equal pay provision is needed. Of the 315 contracts studied by the Womens Bureau that did not have equal pay clauses. some applied to firms with Job evaluation plans or other wage payment provisions based on a ratefortheJob policy. Four times in that one paragraph the word used is \"equal\" and not \"comparable.\" It seems to me quite evident.

I hesitate not only because of my deep respect and affection for the gentlewoman from New York to oppose her in most anything. but I regret that I must do so at this time. for if the gentlewomans amendment were adopted it would create a situation in which the law would be unenforcible. I was disturbed by the question as to whether \"equal\" is the same as \"comparable\" or identical. I discussed this with the Secretary of Labor. and I should like to read his answer to me in writing. It is as follows: The language as so changed. In our opinion. could spell defeat for the bills purpose. \"Equal\" may be interpreted to have a rigid connotation such as \"exact uniformity.\" \"of the same measure.\" and so on1 incompatible with an effective equal pay law which necessarily must be applied on the t basis of similarity between one job in relation to another job but not the exactness e of two Jobs. If a showing of equality was a requisite to establish the requirement of equal pay. the conscious introduction of one slight and trivial factor might be considered sufficient to Justify a lower wage rate. \"Comparable\" is a key word in our proposal. It is used in both tests which are l essential under the proposal to establish the an resemblance between jobs necessitating equal pay. that is. \"work of comparable character\" on Jobs requiring \"comparable skills.\" It connotes an Identity of work operation and .e sktll permitting a realistic and practical apIs praisal of two jobs to determine whether they have enough like characteristics and rS skill demands to warrant the same basic L- pay rate. I thought initially. after discussing this ith the Secretary. that this basis was a ew concept. But I see that there is gal precedent for the word \"comarable.\" The word \"comparable\" is the nly enforcible word to activate this tw. I find it in the National War abor Boards use of the word during orld War II. During that struggle and uring the time when the National War abor Board was in operation there was n effect an equal pay policy in which here was no discrimination on the basis f sex. Mrs. ST.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I move to strike out the requisite number of words. Madam Chairman. I rise to ask the chairman of the subcommittee questions on two subjects. One has to do with the mention during general debate of the difference in beginning job offers to men and women. indicating that womens pay offers generally are a little less than those of men graduating from college. I wonder if a part of that is based on the employers anticipation that in hiring a woman he is less likely to have her on the payroll for a long number of years after training her for the work and. therefore. some of the fixing of wages has that in mind. Is that a factor that is considered or not considered by the bill that is before the House today. or is it a legitimate thing to consider?",

In further response to the gentlemans question in which he asks whether this difference was due to the fact that perhaps some woman or women had worked in a place for some time. may I indicate that in a table which appears on page 63 of the hearings the job requests looking for workers are replete in every industry with requests for workers such as accounting clerks. assemblers. and many other types of available jobs.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the independent and sovereign State of Israel is a political and diplomatic miracle of the century. This may sound a bit overdrawn. but it is hardly that when one considers the expulsion and exclusion of the Jews from the land of Israel until the end of the First World War. their fate in Diaspora for 2.000 years. their ceaseless efforts to retain and revive their spiritual and cultural heritage. their gradual return to Israel. their studied and ingenious attempts toward the creation of a new state. and their remarkable success in the attainment of their longcherished national goal. At the end of World War I. when the British Government was entrusted with the mandate over Palestine. barely onetenth of the people of the country were Jews. the majority were Arabs. But from then on. indefatigable Jewish leaders worked hard and sacrificed much for the increase of Jews in the country. almost wholly by immigration. so that in two decades their number rose to onethird of Palestines total population. about 500.000 of the 1.529.000. Many more thousands had found their way during the last war. so that on the eve of the birth of the new State of Israel in 1948. Jews constituted better than 40 percent of the population. But the ensuing ArabIsraeli war proved that mere numbers did not count as much as the Jewish determination and inflexible will to fight for the attainment of their national goal. In that war more numerous Arabs were no match for the dedicated and disciplined Jews. And. as Jews were victorious against their combined foes. so they have proved themselves capable of organizing their defenses efficiently and effectively. so as to fend themselves against all comers. Todays Israel stands as the embodiment of the centuries old heritage of ancient Israel: It is the home of more than 1.800.000 Jews. At the same time. it is the most modern and most progressive state in the Middle East. This newest state in one of the oldest lands in that area. is a living democracy. a powerful force for advancement and for peace. and a stanch ally of the West in its relentless struggle against totalitarianism of the East. On this 13th anniversary of Israels independence day. we wish prosperity and peace to its devoted and dedicated people.",

This nation of one religious faith has opened its doors to thousands of unfortunates throughout the world who have been deprived of every vestige of property and human rights. These refugees have been molded into a powerful state unit with national integrity and constitutional stability. The strength of Israel has been through the generous contributions of money in the form of loans on the part of many of its sons and daughters throughout the world. In every field. dedicated persons came to establish and organize this new society on every plane of human endeavor known to man. The progress in education. culture. agriculture. and manufacturing have astounded all peoples. The reclaiming of desert lands and irrigational pursuits have been outstanding. Its courts and procedures are a model in justice and the protection of freedoms.

Born in the midst of turbulence and war this tiny nation proved to itself and to the world that it possessed the strength and determination to win its struggle for existence. Not only did it survive but it continued to thrive and prosper so that today it holds a respected position in the family of nations. Recent statistics indicate the rapid rate of growth and progress that has been achieved since 1941: [In thousands] Population --------------------Industrial production ---------Exports -----------------------Imports -----------------------Agricultural production --------Cultivated area ------------Irrigation ------ (in acres).. Afforestation ------------Water usage (in cubic meters) (I) 29. 680 253.120 24. 700 250. 000 2.128 $1. 070. 000 265.000 520. 000 183.000 1.100 64.5 1.400.000 I Negligible. In 1948. Israels 4 ships carried a total of 14.000 tons. In 1960. a fleet of 53 ships handled 445.000 tons of cargo. Elementary school education increased from 108.844 to 600.000 in this period. Arab students now number 42.700. in 1948 only 6.780 were enrolled. And Israels teachers grew in numbers from 5.964 in 1948. to 22.400 in 1960. Israel can be justly proud of this fine record. The early years of Israels life were not easy ones. She was faced with the dual task of creating a strong government and a stable economy while at the same time being forced to expend money and manpower in combating the opposition of the countries surrounding her who were hostile to the idea of her very presence in their midst. However. the spirit. dedication. and sacrifice of a people who from the beginning of their history have always faced a threat to their survival. never failed and their country took shape and developed. As a result Israel enters adulthood confident in the achievement and advancement of her youth yet acutely aware that in the future as in the past there are difficulties that must be met and problems that must be solved before she can enjoy complete peace. We in the United States have special reason to rejoice with Israel in celebrating her birthday. We were the first nation to recognize her independence in 1948 and we have continued to encourage her development and growth. Our faith and support have been justified for today Israel stands as an oasis of democracy in an area of tumult and chaos.",

The birth of the State of Israel constituted the fulfillment of the aspirations of persons of Jewish faith and ancestry all over the world. They have dreamed of creating a state which would stand as a beacon of democracy. peace. and progress in an area of the world historically beset by strife and turmoil. In this sense. the establishment of the State of Israel marked the beginning of a new epoch in the history of the Middle East. the cradle of the spiritual heritage of the western civilization. As we congratulate the State of Israel upon its 13th anniversary. we are mindful of the grave responsibilities and obligations which that country has assumed with its birth. By opening its doors to persons of Jewish faith and ancestry. by working hard with its limited resources and help provided by friends abroad. the State of Israel has achieved considerable material progress. and has provided the opportunity for a new life to many. many persons. But in addition to converting the desert into a garden. the State of Israel has a larger responsibility to mankind itselfthe responsibility to promote peace and amity in the Middle East. and to provide a living example of the vitality and endurance of free institutions. Herein lies its test and potentially its greatest contribution to the enlargement of the area of freedom and peace in our troubled world. As we extend our best wishes to the State of Israel upon this important anniversary. we also wish to express our strong hope that the future may witness the resolution of the complex problems and attitudes which still divide the peoples of the Middle East. so that peace. progress. and freedom may continue to advance in that strategic and vital area of the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the people of Israel and all her friends in America and elsewhere are today celebrating the 13th anniversary of Israels establishment as a free. independent. and democratic State. It was only yesterday. it seems. that we witnessed the historical events associated with the rebirth of Israel to statehoodand now we suddenly realize that 13 years have passed since then. Whatever trepidation or concern we may have had in this country for the welfare of Israel when it was born 13 years ago in the face of armed aggression by its Arab neighbors. we know today that its survival is firmly rooted in the strength of its evergrowing population and in the unflagging support that Israel is getting from the multitude of friends it has in the United States. In these 13 years Israel has demonstrated to the world not only its significance to the life of the Jewish people. but it has also provided a shining example of what a determined people can do when the love of freedom. the desire for national rebirth. and the instinct for social justice inspire its aims and its efforts. This Israel accomplished not by the force of arms. but by its advancement in the fields of agriculture. industry. science. education. and other phases of its national activity. Today Israel enjoys the admiration and good will of many nations and millions of individuals the world over who value Israels friendship and its achievements. I am particularly pleased that the Government and the people of the United States enjoy the most cordial relations with Israel and are cooperating in many spheres of human endeavor for the welfare of all mankind and the peace of the world. I am pleased to note also that President Kennedy has always shown a positive Interest in Israel and that this will lead to greater cooperation between our two countries in the future. On this great anniversary. I extend my best wishes to the people of Israel. to its capable leaders. and to the Jews of America who have a major share in Israels success. May we all soon achieve lasting peace in the world. as is prophesied in the Bible.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on the 13th anniversary of Israels Independence Day it is well to recall that for nearly 2.000 years Jews were practically banned from their historic homeland prior to the rise of todays State of Israel. During all that time they lived in dispersion in all parts of the world. In the course of that long period. In their misery and suffering. in times of troubles and in the face of almost unending adversity. they all cherished the dream of returning to their own ancestral home. After nursing this noble idea fervently. after clinging to it firmly and resolutely. at last Jewish leaders saw the possibility of attaining their goal soon after the First World War. When Palestine was placed under British mandate. the safety of Jews there was assured. and the gradual return of Jews to Palestine seemed guaranteed. Then utmost efforts were made. and Jews worked for the increase of the Jewish population there. In this task they were successful. during the interwar years the number of Jews in Palestine increased from about 80.000 to nearly 500.000. Thus a real beginning was made toward the creation of Israel. In May of 1948. when the British relinquished the mandate. the Jews in Palestine. numbering more than 650.000. pooled all their moral and material forces and proclaimed their independence. Since then the new State of Israel has gone through many ordeals. and happily has come out of them physically stronger and morally unscathed. Today she is a powerful. dynamic. democratic force in the Middle East. a decisive force to be reckoned with in all Middle Eastern affairs. On the 13th anniversary of the birth of Israel we all wish its citizens peace. prosperity and happiness.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today we join with Israel in celebration of the 13th anniversary of her independence. a milestone in the history of human freedom. In 1947. under the leadership of the United States. the General Assembly of the United Nations resolved that there would be established in Palestine an Arab and a Jewish state. A few months later the National Council of the Jewish community in Palestine proclaimed the State of Israel. Since that day the people of Israel have stood forthright as an independent state. a full member of the United Nations. The first task of the Israelis was to rebuild their country. They reclaimed the land. turning desert and swamp into green pastures. New cities were built. old ones expanded at a fantastic rate. Factories were built. and the standard of living of the citizens soared. Having rejuvenated their own country. the people of Israel did not stop. Their assistance was then channeled to the less developed countries. As the United States and other countries had helped Israel in her hour of need. so Israel is now helping the new nations of Asia and Africa. This year 1.000 Asian and African students are expected to study in schools throughout Israel. More than 400 Israeli technical experts have been sent abroad. In Ghana. Israel contributed 40 percent of the capital necessary to establish the countrys steamship line. the Black Star Line. Trained and experienced Israelis will run the line for 5 years. and then it will be turned over to the Ghanians. A similar procedure was followed with a construction firm and Israel has provided technical personnel for a Ghana nautical academy. and to teach civil engineering. Some of the other states which Israel has helped in similar ways are Burma. Liberia. the Congo. and Sierre Leone. It is this relationship between statesa mutual give and takewhich strengthens selfsufficiency and Independence. and which closes the door to Communist infiltration. I salute the people of Israel on this day of their independence.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 13 years ago a new nation was born and has taken its place among the nations of the world. The nation is Israel which was formed as the result of United Nations action with the strong support of the United States. The citizens of Israel are mostly Jewish immigrants from lands where that minority had been suppressed. Principally. of course. the people of Israel were survivors of the Nazi atrocities against the Jews all over Europe. atrocities in which millions perished and hundreds of thousands were left homeless at the end of World War II. The civilized nations of the world took cognizance of this deplorable state of affairs and granted to this segment of the Jewish people. through United Nations recognition of Israel. the right to return to the land of their ancestors. I find myself in the position where I can happily announce that Israel through the efforts of its hardworking people is developing into a model as a new state dedicated to reaffirming for its people the value of human dignity and the rewards of hard work and dedication to the ideals of freedom and democracy. With the formation of the Israeli State the United States has gained a friend in that allimportant part of the world. We salute Israel on the anniversary of its independence and we wish it the best of success in the fulfillments of its inspirations.",

As of midMarch. 101 out of 150 major labor market areas were designated as \"areas of substantial labor surplus\" with unemployment of 6 percent or more. Between January and March of this year. 25 major areas. including my city of Milwaukee. shifted from a category of moderate labor surplus to one of substantial labor surplus. In the Nation. 1 out of every 10 factory workers. 1 out of every 6 workers in steel and other primary metal industries. and 1 out of every 4 automobile workers are unemployed.

BLOODGOOD: We wish to call to your attention recent bidding to the Bureau of Reclamation in Denver of the U.S. Department of the Interior for four 70.000 horsepower hydraulic turbines for Yellowtail Dam in Montana under Invitation DSThe three low bidders were as follows: Mitsubishi (100percent Japanese) ---------------------- $1.053. 893 Hitachi (100percent Japanese)- 1.503. 138 AllisChalmers (100percent American) ------------------ 1.550. 000 There were nine additional bids offered at higher prices ranging to approximately $22 million including four 100percent foreign bids. three 100percent American bids. and two combination bids of American and foreign source qualifying as American bids. We believe that a possible award to one of the two low Japanese bidders wouldbe prejudicial to the American economy and American labor in the current period of business recession and anxiety which is causing a continuous curtailment of employment at American plants such as we possess. and which manufacture similar equipment to that bid in this Invitation. Further. award of this contract to a bidder utilizing foreign source components would aggravate the U.S. balanceofpayments problem. the outflow of gold. and contribute to additional unemployment. With approximately $10 million out of a total of some $29.500.000 worth of hydraulic turbine equipment purchased in the United States last year going to foreign sources and over 50 percent of the business let in 1959 going foreign. the AllisChalmers hydraulic turbine operation here in York. Pa.. has found it necessary to layoff 151 employees (out of a total starting employment of 1.163) thus far this year. We expect this situation to be further aggravated in the latter months of this year and continue unabated into the foreseeable future. We ask your very serious consideration in awarding the hydraulic turbine for Yellowtail Dam to the low 100percent American bidder. AllisChalmers.

We owe it to ourselves to take a good. hard look at what we are doing. We ought to consider seriously what our fiscal situation is. As you know. the deficit for this year is $7.3 billion. the deficit for 1963. estimated conservatively. will run somewhere between $10 billion and $15 billion. Yet we continue to run large international deficits. We have less than $5 billion to take care of $23 billion of obligations held by foreigners. One little country in Europe could force us into a fiscal crisis. If Switzerland alone were to demand gold for her U.S. dollars and other holdings. the United States could not meet its obligations and we would be forced to devalue our dollar. I think it is appropriate at this time to read an article by Constantine Brown appearing in the Washington Star a few days ago. Here is what the Swiss bankers think of the fiscal management of the United States. And. as you know. the Swiss bankers are the most able international students of finance. Here is what the Swiss bankers think of the United States and our fiscal management: The core of your troubles is the frenzied public expenditures and your inability to come near to balancing your budget. Frankly. your governments have acted In the past and are acting now like the proverbial improvident sailor who throws his money away without regard for the morrow. You have a deficit of $7 billion this year. Our estimates are that unless the Washington administration puts a stronger brake on expenditures. both domestic and foreign. your next years deficit will be at least as large. if not larger. I believe that unless you trim your sails considerably in domestic and foreign expenditures. you are facing the most serious crisis in your existence. And should this occur. you will drag us down with you. despite our present efforts to help you and at the same time take our precautions to meet what may be an economic hurricane.

It offers such opportunity under circumstances whereby the risk is shifted actually to the Bonneville power users. Mr. Chairman. there is a total of $131 million involved. If Bonneville raises its rates by 1 mill only. it will collect an additional $28.5 million a year. So they need only be raised by 1 mill for a period of 5 years in order to pay back more than this total investment. Therefore. it is a fairly good deal. Mr. Chairman. as to the specific amendment I offer. I offer it for two purposes: One. for fairness. Two. for technical reasons. Mr. Chairman. in fairness. I believe that the private utilities of this Pacific Northwest area should be allowed to come in on a nondiscriminatory basis and take up onehalf of the power that this promises. if they assume onehalf of the obligations that are involved. The amendment requires this: It requires the private utilities and the public utilities to come in promptly at the beginning and assume the same liability as anyone else. Second. my amendment provides that should for any reason the plant be recaptured or captured by the Federal Government. it can be done only by congressional authorization under arrangements by which the obligations to the various public and private utilities involved would be honored.

Mr. Chairman. may I say that I supported the Van Zandt amendment to the proposal when it was up before the House some months ago to provide $95 million in Federal financing to build the facility at Hanford. Let me say to my colleagues in the House that today we are discussing controversial legislation. and we are discussing discriminatory legislation. My basic reason for supporting the Van Zandt amendment then is my basic reason for supporting it today. This legislation is discriminatory against one of the Nations basic fuels. and I am speaking now of a major industry in my State. which is coal. I can remember a few years ago when the Northwest received its supply of coal from West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Today millions of cubic feet of natural gas pour in from Canada and Mexico in competition not only with your electricity which you are creating up there. but also in competition with coal. The condition of the coal industry today can be laid right at the doorstep of Congress for repeatedly passing discriminatory legislation. Permitting the import of residual fuel oil is another instance. My position on that is perfectly clear. To pass this legislation without the Van Zandt amendment limiting the authority of the Federal Government is just to encourage more discriminatory action against an industry that you cannot afford to destroy. and I am speaking about the coal industry.",

He has put his finger on one of the most important omissions in the pending bill. and on a proposal which has no parallel in American history. which cannot be successful. We will never be able to establish an international satellite communications system unless the sovereign Government of the United States negotiates treaties with other nations. We cannot delegate that authority to a private corporation. or to anyone else. We cannot do it. I do not believe the American people would sanction it. I do not believe governments of other nations would be anxious to negotiate with It. As to what the Senator said about Senators not being here. I agree with him. We do have many other duties. Senators are hard pressed for time. However. I have talked with a great many Senators who are not on any of the committees which have considered the bill and who did not have the privilege of hearing the testimony before the Space Committee. before the Commerce Committee. or before the Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee. There is a lack of full understanding of the provisions of the bill and what it does to us. not only from the standpoint of foreign policy. but also with respect to the development of a real system. These things are not fully understood by a great many Members of the Senate. So for that reason I hope that they will find time to come to the Chamber. engage in colloquy. and listen to the debate as much as possible. I thought the speech made by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana . Was a remarkable analysis of the bill and one of the finest presentations I have heard since I became a Member of the Senate.

Existing regulations. however. as contained in the Manual for CourtsMartial. provide that members of the Army and Air Force have the right to demand a trial by courtmartial in lieu of nonjudicial punishment prior to the imposition of the punishment. At the same time these regulationsparagraph 132provided that no member of the Navy or Coast Guard may demand trial by courtmartial in lieu of nonjudicial punishment. The bill extends to a considerable degree. as compared to existing law. the nonjudicial punishments which may be imposed by a commanding officer. Under such circumstances the committee feels that all military members. except those attached to or embarked in a vessel. should have the statutory right to demand a courtmartial in lieu of accepting nonjudicial punishment. Except for the military members aboard ship. the effect of the committee amendment will be to continue the existing practice in the Army and Air Force and. at the same time. extend the right to members of the Navy. Marine Corps. and Coast Guard. Because of testimony by the Navy. the right to demand a trial by courtmartial in lieu of nonjudicial punishment was not extended to those aboard ship. in view of the unique responsibilities of the ships captain and in the interest of maintaining morale and discipline aboard ship. Since it would be the ships commander who would impose nonjudicial punishment. the right to demand a trial would involve. first. the question of maintaining discipline where a person aboard ship could refuse the punishment to be imposed by the commanding officer for minor infractions. and second. the matter of a courtmartial being conducted by a junior officer appointed by the commanding officer to make a judgment on the same set of facts that have been considered by the commanding officer. The committee would like to emphasize that only in rare cases would it appear that personnel would demand a trial by courtmartial. It would be expected that nonjudicial punishment would be accepted for most minor infractions.",

Mr. Zabel. whose organization represents an industry employing over 300.000 people and some 28.000 companies. not including newspapers. points out that existing inadequate depreciation allowances prevent and hamper the replacement of wornout and technologically obsolescent machinery in the printing industry. Mr. Zabel writes: We are especially handicapped by the long periods of time over which we are required to write off the costs of heavy equipment. A classic example is a printing press installed in 1935 at a cost of $34.000. To replace it in 1958. 23 years later. an investment of $128.000 was required. Even conceding that the replacement was technologically improved. and more productive than the old one. the cost of the new press was four times the oldan obvious hardship on the taxpayer. As sponsor of legislation directed at modernizing our current depreciation tax policies. I am especially interested in Mr. Zabels views and in the graphic example he supplies concerning replacement costs in the printing industry. As we know. the printing industry is only one of many which are seriously hampered by existing depreciation laws. Mr. Zabels example can be applied throughout the economy. to every American business caught between rising replacement costs and static. unrealistic tax policies.",

Mr. Chairman. this bill. as the distinguished gentleman from Texas has said. comes to the floor with practically unanimous agreement in the committee. I would assume that if every member of the subcommittee could have written a bill there would have been seven different bills. This shows a substantial reduction. but it should be pointed out that this is not a savings of the amount which is indicated here. The amount for the Defense Department. which shows a reduction on the record of $263 million is in fact a transfer of funds. It is true we are not appropriating any new funds for the Department. but we are giving the right of transfer. so I do not know whether we are going to save any money or not. There are other transfers. We have new posts in Africa. I think we are sending too many people there. Perhaps when the regular bill comes to the floor there will be an improvement. It is interesting to note the amount that has been absorbed by some of the agencies of the pay raises. Some branches did a good job. others not so good. It would seem to me that we can try to answer the questions which the membership may have on this bill. but it is generally an agreement in the subcommittee.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on Wednesday of last week the President of the United States held a press conference. At that time he saw fit to announce that he would appoint Dr. Robert Weaver as Secretary of Urban Affairs and Housing should such a post be created in the future. At the time it seemed extremely strange to some of us that the President would designate an individual for a post not yet created by the Congress. The following day the chairman of the Democrat National Committee held a press conference in which he openly and blatantly charged that opposition to the proposed new Department of Urban Affairs and Housing was predicated on racial bias. and. in particular. opposition to the appointment of Dr. Weaver to a position in the Cabinet. It has. therefore. now become abundantly clear that some of the proponents of this legislation are stooping to sheer demagogery. and fanning the fires of racial prejudice in a vain effort to justify their demands for a Department of Urban Affairs and Housing. I am. therefore. very pleased to note that the National Association of Real Estate Boards. through its president. Arthur P. Wilcox. has issued a statement condemning this administration tactic. I include. therefore. with my remarks the statement issued on January 26. 1962. by Mr. Wilcox:",

REA estimated that 152.000 farms in the State or 98.3 percent of all farms recorded in the 1959 census of agriculture. were being served by June 30. 1960. Of these electrified farms. 51.8 percent were being served by REA borrowers.

One of these. the Suburban Electric Corp.. has discharged its financial obligation to REA. Mr. Speaker.I am pleased that 98 out of every 100 farm families in Illinois are served by electrical power and commend REA for their assistance in this project. Frankly. the REA and the coops it helps to finance have done such a good job that. in many places. they are running out of rural customers. Many people are now becoming alarmed over the fact that federally subsidized electric cooperatives are engaging in a new type of unfair competition with American business. They are moving into the field of industrial development. Among those who are concerned are the 1.600.994 paidup member families of the American Farm Bureau in 49 States.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have recently received a memorandum on foreign investment prepared by Mr. Percy L. Douglas. president of the Otis Elevator Co.. which takes issue with the Treasury Departments contention that foreign investment. particularly in advanced countries. adversely affects our balance of payments. Mr. Douglas points out that although Otis has preferred to supply foreign markets by exporting from the United States. it was at times necessary to locate abroad in order to maintain its position in elevator markets throughout the world. Despite an initial adverse effect on the balance of payments. Otis has over the past 15 years brought into the United States more than $12 million for each million sent out in loans and investment. Mr. Douglas also points out that over 90 percent of the $63 million worth of equipment Otis has exported over the past 15 years has gone to countries where Otis has its own organization. This investment. therefore. has not resulted in an export of jobs as claimed by the Treasury Department but is the direct cause of a great many jobs which otherwise would not exist. Mr. Speaker. we should not be too hasty to assume that socalled preferred treatment of income earned abroad by business firms is harmful to our domestic economy or to our balance of payments. The improved competiA659 Janvary 30 tive position of European manufacturers will leave many American industries with the choice of participating from within the European market through investment in Europe or leaving it altogether. Nor should we be mislead by the shortrange disadvantages of foreign investment without considering also the longrange returns which they provide. I can highly recommend Mr. Douglas report to those in the House who are concerned with the vital issues of reciprocal trade and tax reform now before the Congress and the country. and therefore would like to insert it in the RECORD at this point:",

Washington. and Wilcoxmade a magnificent contribution to the agriculture of this State last year. The work that county agents and their assistants carried out with farmers and their familiesand all others interested .in promoting agriculturewas done in a splendid way. Annunal records point out the agents outstanding accomplishments. Let us look at a few examples. Clarke County Agent 0. C. Helms assisted in some way all 1.494 farms in his county during 1961. Mobile County Agent Charles J. Brockway made an excellent record of 2.254 farm visits in his county. In Monroe County. Agent A. V. Culpepper assisted 2.183 out of 2.873 farm families sometime during the year. County Agent D. 0. Estes in Washington County was real active in 4H work. He has an outstanding number of 42 4H Clubs in the county. County Agent R. M. Barnett in Wilcox County was called on 3.030 times by farmers. Statistics for the entire district are even more impressive. For example. this district reports to me that county agents have made 11.725 visits to help farmers with their pressing problems. They have distributed 56.083 different bulletins over the counties. and have held 3.293 meetings throughout the district with the attendance totaling about 128.000. District No. 1 also has 191 active 4H Clubs. This is an average of 27 clubs per county. Timber was the districts highest income source. This item brought a total of $14.500.000. The beef cattle total was second with $14.293.000. Other Items which contributed to the districts rural income were cotton. dairying. poultry. hogs. sheep. grain crops. peanuts. fruits. vegetables. and other truck crops. Congressional District 1 throws out to these agents and their assistants a vote of thanks for their outstanding work for the year of 1961. It is with a great deal of pleasure and appreciation that I salute F. M. Barnett. Charles J. Brockway. A. V. Culpepper. D. 0. Estes. F. M. Jones. 0. C. Helms. and Matthew Sexton.

Many people believe that such magazines pay little for their mail service. I am sure they will be surprised to learn the Farm Journal spends an average of almost $300.000 per year for postage and that they have operated at a loss for the past 2 years. Farmers in every section of the United States have for decades depended to a large degree on the information and advice furnished them in farm magazines. and since all wellinformed people know that farming is our basic industry. it ill behooves this Congress to legislate these important periodicals out of existence. as the postal rate bill which this House passed on last Wednesday will help to do. At that time I made a determined effort to get some time to read the following letter into the RECORD. while the bill was being railroaded through the House. but failing to get the time. I have decided that since this matter is of such farreaching importance to our farmers. duty demands that I insert it in the RECORD. A number of farm magazines have already been forced to quit business because of high overhead. Now. Mr. Speaker.

The old Pennsylvania Dutch have a way of putting it much more eloquent than I.

We want our countrys economy to \"back up straight ahead.\" Let us quit looking atthe greener grass in the fields of our neighbors overseas while our fields go to seed.

By providing a less expensive. deepsea water route to the ports of the world for the products of our farms and factories. Now that the seaway is completed. however. I believe it would be a great mistake to forget about itto assume the attitude that progress \"will take care of itself.\" and that the desirable volume of trade and commerce will automatically find its way through the waterway. By experience. we have learned that this almost never happens. The American people have a $140 million investment in the waterway. Unless the project is made to \"pay off\" this will mean loss to the taxpayer. A far. greater loss. however. would be that of failing to take advantage of the new economic opportunity offered by the waterway. I have long felt that a vastly expanded effort is needed to encourage a larger flow of trade and commerce. I sincerely hope that members of the Appropriations Committee will sympathetically consider this matter when the appropriations bill comes up for consideration. Recently. I was privileged to receive a letter from Marvin Fast. executive director of the Great Lakes Commission. conveying the views of the commission. on the need for greater efforts to expand traffic through the seaway.

    "speech": "Mr. President. there is nothing new in the proposed legislation. The bill would simply extend the Reorganization Act. in all of its terms and provisions. identically as it is at present. It would extend until June 1963. the time for the President to exercise the authority and powers which the present act confers upon him. In times past. in the course of the development of the present law. controversies have arisen with respect to its provisions. its limitations. the authority it grants. and the veto power of Congress with respect to reorganization plans. The conflicting views. however. over the past dozen years. have finally been resolved. Each side has made some concessions. The result is that the statute now. in my opinion. adequately preserves the integrity of the legislative process. and. at the same time. confers upon the President the power to reorganize the executive branch of the Government. No agency of the executive branch of the Government is now exempt from that authority. This was not true in the original acts passed by Congress. So far as I know. there is no objection to the bill or to the statute in Its present form. The power to reorganize has been given to past Presidents. certainly the same authority should be accorded to President Kennedy and the new administration. I therefore trust the bill as reported by the committee will pass.",

First. the allocation formula is based upon the number of lunches served and the assistanceneed rate for the State. This was a necessary amendment since under existing law. the higher income States were in better position to provide lunches for their school population than many States that needed the lunches more. The assistanceneed rate. based upon average annual income. would apportion funds based upon the number of lunches served the previous year and on the income level of the State. This bill would also provide a 3year transition for applying the new formulathus giving the States sufficient time to adjust to the new program. Provision is also made for the apportionment of funds between public and private schools. Because certain States may not contribute directly to private institutions. such funds must be distributed through the Department of Agriculture. In so doing. more schoolchildren may profit from this very important program. Through the special assistance fund. certain schools drawing attendance from areas in which poor economic conditions exist and which are not financially able will be able to operate a lunch program to meet the needs for free or substantially reduced price lunches among those children unable to pay the full price of the lunch.

House Resolution 803 provides for the consideration of S. 1123. a bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to extend the child labor provisions thereof to certain children employed in agriculture. and for other purposes. The resolution provides an open rule with 1 hour of general debate. The exploitation of children in agriculture is one of the more objectionable aspects of the farm labor situation. Child labor has all but disappeared in industry. but it is still very much in evidence on some of our industrialized farms. Although the Fair Labor Standards Act regulates the employment of children in industry. and the employment of children in agriculture during school hours. there is no age limit for the employment of children in agriculture outside school hours. nor is there protection afforded these youngsters in the event of personal injury. S. 1123 seeks to extend the child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 so as to correct and/or eliminate labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health. efficiency. and general wellbeing of certain children employed in agriculture.

Almost all of this production is of the type called specialty crops which are harvested by what is commonly referred to as stoop labor. including children. affected by this law. Mr. Speaker. I am becoming increasingly resentful of the exaggerated. false. and untrue statements that are being made about the farmers I represent. We are not slave drivers. we are not Simon Legrees who seek to exploit little children. We really are quite human and we are quite decently motivated. I am tired of articles like the one that appeared on page 3 of the committee report. Just let me read it to you. This is an article quoted from the November 1960 issue of Good Housekeeping. It says: We saw dozens of kids as young as 7 picking potatoes under a blistering sun. They were performing hard. adult labor. working rapidly. mechanically. without pause. dripping sweat as they stripped potatoes from the plant * * *. Then it goes on to say: They picked in silence. with intense concentration. They stooped. crawled. and stretched. taking no time for rest or chatter. except when the machine broke down. These potatoes were admittedly harvested by machine. And I would like to see anybody strip a potato from a plant that has been so harvested. This author did not know what he was talking about. He did not see what he wrote about. It is exaggerated. it is not true. Potatoes grow underground. they are part of the root. and when the machine turns them up they are separated from the root and all you do is pick them up and put them in a sack. This is an exaggerated report which has been printed in a committee report to the Congress of the United States.",

Summer schools offering migrant children remedial work on a noncompulsory basis have found that attendance is sharply limited because the children who would benefit most are employed in farmwork. Thousands of migrant families leave the South for work farther north each April and May. Although as much as 2 months may remain in the school year. these families rarely enroll their children in school in the communities to which they have moved. This is a human tragedy and particularly for youngsters who also need every possible aid in obtaining an education which would equip them for work and occupations outside the migratory groups and give these children equal opportunity. as I have stated. Migrant children need to be freed of work which is too hazardous and fatiguing for a youngster. Mr. Speaker. a material start toward meeting the needs of our migrant children was made earlier this year through enactment of the Public Welfare Amendments of 1962. This law. authorizing funds for child daycare services. will make it possible to provide migratory children with healthful recreation and proper supervision while their parents are at work. The next step. through enactment of S. 1123. is to remove the obstacles to normal childhood and adequate education for the migrant that is imposed by permissible child labor. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. President. there has. of course. been a great deal of discussion on the poll tax issue. I think it is unfortunate that we dwell on a matter of this nature when there are so many important issues that deserve the attention of this body. We have talkbd a great deal here about the relationship of the poll tax issue to the American Federal system. the constitutional system. I would like to emphasize one aspect of this question. the threat of the Communist Party internally in this country. Some persons have held that the Communist Party does not constitute much of a threat. that there are only 8.000 or 10.000 members of that party in this country. and. so far as any open advocacy of the Communist faith is concerned. I am sure that not too many Americans would be inclined to follow them. However. they are a small. carefully organized. highly disciplined group. work in very insidious ways. and wield an influence out of all proportion to their numbers. Witness the vast number of Communist front organizations that can be found on the Attorney Generals list. and note the large number of people. perhaps most of whom are not Communists. who belong to those groups. So they can deceive wellmeaning persons who might conceivably be opinion leaders in the United States. I notice that the Justice Department has failed to vigorously prosecute Communists in this country. I would like to go into the background of this issue a little. On September 23. 1950. the Congress of the United States passed. over the veto of the President. the Internal Security Act of 1950. which is popularly known as the McCarran Act. after the late Hon. Pat McCarran. then chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. On December 21. 1950. the Senate. by approval of Senate Resolution 366. created the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary and instructed it to \"make a complete and continuing study of the administration. operation. and enforcement\" of the act. of other laws relating to espionage. sabotage. and the protection of the internal security of the United States. and of the \"extent. nature. and effects of subversive activities in the United States.\"",

But if we put all that into the law. we would straitjacket the administration. Those who want that authority will then contact the administrator. and under this section he will make up a list of those who might receive such authoritya list which might even go beyond the very fertile comprehension of the distinguished Senator.

If within a reasonable time he does not release that plane. but insists upon maintaining it as the property of the Cuban Government. it will be manifest that he is holding stolen property and refusing to deliver it to its true owners. If such conduct is perpetrated by an individual. he is guilty not only of violating the law but all rules of morality.

Today. there is a general realization that the future of our Nation and our Western civilization directly depends upon the quality and availability of educational opportunity. There is the great awakening to the realization that our national survivaland the survival of free institutions everywhere on earthdepends upon the product of schools and colleges in the free world. When considered in this context. it is enormously important that every one of usand particularly those who formulate education policy in our State legislatures and in the Congressare directed toward strengthening and improving the American system of education. In reaching this objective. I believe certain principles to be sound and progressive and summarize them as follows: First. The basic responsibility for providing education rests with the State government. communities. and private groups. and Federal control or direction of education must be avoided at all costs. Second. There is a continuing but increasingly profound national interest in education which makes it appropriate for the Federal Government to assist in strengthening and improving education. Third. Federal programs. therefore. must be designed to assist States and communities and public and private institutions of higher education to overcome educational needs which must. in the national interest. be fulfilled. but which oftentimes State. local. and private action alone is insufficient to meet. Fourth. The role of the Federal Government. therefore. is to assist States and communities and educational institutions to meet educational needs without weakening State. local. and private responsibility and without substituting Federal funds for traditional sources of educational revenue. We should make dead certain that Federal aid stimulates additional educational effort.",

I believe. a fair oneit would have to be concluded that the record is inadequate and disappointing. Peoples expectations were high. and for a number of reasons: The 1960 platforms of both political parties promised action on a wide variety of problems. for the first time since 1954. the President belonged to the party which controlled both House and Senate. the majorities in both Houses were substantial. the session was the longest since the wartime year of 1951. and the President submitted no less than 355 specific legislative requests to the Congress. Although Congress passed a large volume of legislation. most of it was relatively unimportant. On the big issuestax reform. education. foreign aid. civil rights. transportation. agriculture. labor. and othersCongress either failed to act at all or drastically revised Presidential proposals. There are several explanations for Congress poor record. Most important. perhaps. was the administrations failure to establish priorities and to concentrate on obtaining approval for its most important recommendations. Related to this was the impression created by the administration that it favored quantitative solutions to problems rather than qualitative solutions. that it believed that spending more money and starting new programs would automatically produce desirable results. As the session progressed and it became more apparent that a deficit was inevitable. Congressmen developed a healthy fear of the inflationary effects of an unbalanced budget. This. together with the mood of moderation shared by most Members this year. brought an increasingly negative response to administration requests. The worsening international situation. and the huge increase in defense spending it required. took Congress attention away from domestic matters and confirmed Members reluctance to embark on new and expensive programs.",

Area redevelopment. minimum wage. omnibus housing. and major amendments to the farm programthese and other measures followed one after the other in quick succession as Congress moved to meet the challenge of the sixties.

H.R. 929. which was introduced by our colleague. the Honorable JOHN BYRNES. and which was unanimously reported by your Committee on Ways and Means. provides that prepaid dues income of certain membership organizations may. at the election of such organizations. be included in their gross income ratably over the period of time during which such organizations are under a liability to provide services to their duespaying members. Except as to effective date. the provisions of this bill are the same as those that were contained in the bill H.R. 11266. which was unanimously approved by the House on August 24. 1960. but which was not acted upon by the other body prior to the adjournment of the 86th Congress. The membership organizations to which this bill applies are limited to those which compute their income on an accrual basis. which have no capital stock. and. which make no distributions of net earnings to members. Furthermore. in order for this bill to apply. the liability of such organizations to provide service to their members must extend beyond the end of the current year but may not extend beyond a period of more than 36 months. Finally. since under present law it has been held that such organizations must include the full amount of any prepaid dues in income in the year of receipt. in order to mitigate the effect of the revenue loss involved. the bill contains a special transitional rule which operates to spread the revenue loss attributable to any given year over a 5year period. The bill would be effective for taxable years beginning in 1961 and provides substantially similar treatment to that provided for prepaid subscription income by the Technical Amendments Act of 1958.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. H.R. 929. which has just passed the House. was unanimously reported by the Committee on Ways and Means. The legislation is identical with H.R. 11266 which passed the House in the 86th Congress. except for a change in effective date. The bill is concerned with the relationship of income tax accounting to generally accepted accounting principles with respect to prepaid income arising from membership dues. H.R. 929 pertains to the way in which prepaid membership dues shall be treated for income tax purposes by the receiving membership organization. The membership organizations to which H.R. 929 applies are those which have no capital stock and which make no distributions of net earnings to members. Under the bill prepaid dues income is to be included in income for tax purposes ratably over the period during which a liability to render services exists as a consequence of the payment of membership dues. The bill requires that the liability involved must extend beyond the end of the current taxable year but not beyond a period of more than 36 months. It will be recalled that the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as originally enacted contained section 452 which provided an election to taxpayers to report prepaid income over the period of time that the prepaid income was being earned. Section 452 was subsequently repealed by the Congress. At the time the section was repealed the Congress indicated the intention to give further study to the tax treatment of prepaid income as well as prepaid expenses with a view to developing appropriate accounting provisions for the tax treatment of these types of transactions. In 1958 the Internal Revenue Code was amended to provide for the spreading forward of prepaid subscription income in the case of newspapers and periodicals. H.R. 929 would permit the spreading forward of prepaid membership income.",

In addition. the Senate added two other amendments not pertaining to pension funds. The first of these amendments would continue for 2 years1960 and 1961the provision of the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 which permitted certain stock life insurance companies to deduct amounts expended in redeeming stock from shareholders pursuant to a plan of mutualization. The extension of this privilege for 2 years is required by the fact that at least one mutualized company was unable to complete its plan of mutualization within the period provided in the 1959 act. The second Senate amendment not pertaining to pension funds provides for reduced tariffs in the case of imports of Cashmere goat hair. It is my understanding that there is no commercial production of cashmere in the United States.

Mr. Speaker. first I would like to sincerely commend the chairman of the subcommittee. the gentleman from South Carolina. and the members of the Subcommittee on Elections for the diligent work and hard work. and the sincere way in which they approached this very difficult and unpleasant problem. I would also like to express our appreciation to the members of the committee staff. the legal section of the Library of Congress Reference Service. the professional staff of auditors and accountants loaned to us by the General Accounting Office. and others who worked on this problem. There is an understandable difference in the wellfounded opinion by many Members of the House on the question of the observance of State election laws as compared with precedents which have been established in the House. Under the Constitution of the United States. however. each House of the Congress is given the responsibility of determining the seating of its Members when a question is raised. This responsibility has been under House rules given to our Committee on House Administration. There is another question which is disturbing some of us. and that is the possible overlap of jurisdiction of a special committee appointed each 2 years for the purpose of studying campaign expenditures. Many of us believe that the special committee in this past 86th Congress went too far and went beyond its proper jurisdiction in the actions recommended by its chairman on January 3 of this year. Mr. Speaker. I think this is a matter which the Members of the House should seriously consider when the next committee of that kind is appointed. because the organization of the House may well be determined by a very close majority or even a disputed majority of the House at some time in the future. Thus the Members of this House of Representatives should very carefully examine the jurisdiction of any special committee to be appointed in the future for the purpose of investigating campaign expenditures.",

This means it has. in all respects. been conducted objectively. impartially. and I believe wholly without regard to personality or party.

I know that a most conscientious job was done by the subcommittee. Those of you who have been familiar with these efforts will. I am sure. join me in assuring our colleagues that the subcommittee. chairmaned by the able gentleman from South Carolina has performed most creditably and sincerely a rather difficult task.

I would like to inform my colleagues in the House of the deeds of Peter Francisco because I feel that in his life there is a lesson for all Americans who love their country and who would dedicate themselves to its service. Peter Francisco was not a native of Virginia nor. indeed. of this country. His origin is obscure but he was apparently the victim of a kidnaping in a foreign land. In 1765. at the age of five or six. he was left. friendless and alone. on the wharf at City Point. now Hopewell. Va.. by a ship that immediately sailed away. His dark complexion. his features. and his name seemed to point to Portugal as the land of his origin. His rich clothingalthough seaworn and showing hard usagethe silver buckles engraved \"P.F.\" that adorned his shoes. and his courageous bearing and engaging manner encouraged the impression that he was of noble parentage. It was fortunate for Peter Francisco that. shortly after his arrival. Judge Anthony Winston stopped by City Point on business. Winston was returning home from Williamsburg where he had heard the fiery \"Caeser and Brutus\" speech of his nephew. Patrick Henry. He was interested in the lad and took a load off the shoulders of the parish authorities by obtaining their readily given permission to take the boy to \"Hunting Towers.\" his home in Buckingham County. There Francisco spent the next 10 years. His formal education seems to have been neglected. but from the discussions of Patrick Henry and other visitors he gained an understanding of the principles of freedom and a zeal for the cause of liberty.",

These carriers are principally in the charter business and were designated for that reason. In recent years they have been doing ticketing under certain emergency conditions permitted by the Civil Aeronautics Board. There has been a great deal of objection and the problem has arisen in the ticketing field. I do not know how many of those now ticketing are going to survive when the Federal Aviation Agency and the CAB get this authority which we have given them in this bill to wind up all of those who are not competent. who are not safe and who are not qualified to do business.

S. 3066. calling for an immediate study of alternative programs that might be established to help provide financial assistance to those suffering property losses in flood disasters. The bill specified that the feasibility and cost of each alternative should be studied and that the findings and recommendations of the study should be reported to the President for submission to Congress no later than January 30. 1963. The purpose of the bill was not only to provide for a reevaluation of the 1956 flood insurance program. but also to provide for an exploration of other alternatives which might overcome the objections that led to the rejection of funds to implement the 1956 insurance program by the House of Representatives. As I said at the time. I believe that legislation calling for this kind of broadscale study offers the best hope for allowing positive and constructive action to be taken in the reasonably near future. I was greatly pleased when. on May 31. the President issued a special statement endorsing this bill. stating that the administration would request a supplemental appropriation of $500.000 to finance the study should Congress indicate favorable action on the authorization.

On February 16. 1918. the Lithuanian nation had reestablished its independence after over a century of Russian domination followed by German occupation during World War I. During her two decades of independence. Lithuania made great economic and social progress as a democratic state with a constitution that guaranteed the basic freedoms of speech. assembly. and religion. With the outbreak of the Second World War. Lithuania had attempted to maintain a policy of absolute neutrality but she was gradually engulfed. In 1939. the Soviet Union forced a mutual assistance treaty upon the country requiring Lithuania to grant airbases to the Soviet Union and to admit Soviet garrisons. On June 15. 1940. the Soviets demanded immediate formation of a friendly government and occupied the country. In August of that year the Baltic States were deprived of their independence and incorporated into the U.S.S.R. by means of force and fraudulent elections. On June 14. 1941. the Soviet police began the deportations. It is estimated that between June 14 and 21 close to 40.000 personsyoung and old. men and women and childrenwere forcibly torn from their homes and loved ones and shipped off to slave labor camps in remote areas of Siberia and the Arctic. Several thousand more were executed when the Soviet forces retreated in haste under German attack. When the Soviets retook the country in 1944 new waves of mass deportations followed. The United States has denounced this crime of aggression and consistently refused to recognize the Communist claims to these people and their territories. On the anniversary of these inhuman crimes against the people of Lithuania and the other Baltic States. it is only right that we should pay tribute to these brave. freedom loving people who have endured so much. We can only hope and pray that the time will soon come when these brave people will regain their rightful place among freemen.",

I have known that American firms doing business through subsidiaries abroad have been greatly worried about the foreign tax proposals contained in H.R. 10650. but until I read a statement in the New York Times of June 21. I did not realize that the very existence of this bill has begun to disturb the government and people of friendly nations. The story to which I refer has a dateline of Sydney. Australia. June 20. and reveals that the U.S. Embassy in Canberra found it necessary to make a statement whose purpose was to quiet the fears of the people of Australia that. as a result of this bill. American investment In Australia would be reduced. Of course. the Embassy official who made this statement had no way of knowing what might happen if the bill were actually passed. but the fact that the statement was made is a part of the present pattern and program of the New Frontier to try and calm with words the fears that are created by its recommendations.

    "speech": "Mr. President. let me say at the beginning that I have no objection to the penalty amendment which has been offered by the Senator from New York . My purpose is not to speak in opposition to it. Certainly there is no objection to a stiffer penalty for a second offense. I go along with him wholeheartedly on that provision. We might be a little objective. however. as to the second part of the amendment. I have discussed it with the Senator from New York. It would impose a stiff penalty. which ought to be imposed upon the kind of offense covered there. However. there will be great difficulty in most cases in proving a willful act. The chances are that a great many cases will have to be handled. as the Senator from New York himself has suggested. as misdemeanors. simply because these cases often involve not just shipments to the Soviet bloc but transshipments. which might go through three or four different hands. I can see that there could be doubt about the usefulness of this provision on the part of the Justice Department. and I understand it may want to question that particular part of the amendment because of the difficulty that might be involved. However. I believe that the Senator from New York has made a reasonable statement on it and has recognized that difficulty. and realizes that in case the difficulty is too great. if there is failure to prove willfulness in connection with it. the accused could perhaps be convicted of the lesser offense of the same indictment. In any event. I want to point out this problem which may be involved in this amendment. The Senator from New York has three different amendments to the bill. It is my understanding with the Senator that we will accept two of them and that he will not insist upon the third. Letters were sent to the chairman of the committee. the Senator from Virginia . by the Department of Commerce. also from the Department of Defense. and the Department of the Treasury. and the Department of State. dealing with these proposed amendments. These letters. except the State Department letter. deal with all three amendments. and the Departments set forth their position on the three amendments. I ask unanimous consent that these letters may be inserted in the RECORD at this point.",

It is not necessary to represent anything to the Government in order to ship goods to Canada. Goods have been transshipped from Canada to Communist countries. That will happen again.

I thought the Senator from New York had satisfactorily explained that if difficulty arose. the Government could proceed under the misdemeanor statute. or perhaps an indictment could be so drawn as to obtain a conviction for the lesser offense. I should like to make one more insertion in the RECORD. It involves enforcement activities. I should like to get across the ideaand I am sure the Senator from New York will agree with methat the Export Control Act has not been a dead letter by any means. It has been quite actively enforced. I notice that during the first quarter of this year $343.590 worth of shipments were apparently destined for Cuba. There has been a total seizure of 53 different shipments valued at $502.497. Of that number. four. having a value of $343.590. were destined for Cuba. During the past 2 years. according to the report from the Secretary of Commerce. shipments to the value of $1.335.066 have been made. I think Senators will be interested to know that of that amount $513.003 was apparently destined for Cuba. Cuba did not come under the act until within the last year or two. So during that time there have been seizures of half a million dollars worth of shipments destined for Cuba. Mr. President.

This does not require one additional dollar. but it directs the Post Office Department to use their own funds and accept the frank for mail addressed to the box holder. Here is the point involved. We all use the frank. some more and some less. I think it is a grand thing. It seems that those who use it are those who usually stay here the longest. My trouble is. perhaps. that I do not use it enough. But I just want you to let me give you the benefit of my experience. and I am sure that that experience is going to coincide exactly with yours. I am not speaking of the trouble and expense that it is to the Members. but I am talking of the expense to the Post Office Department in handling this mail. You will send out a batch of mail of. perhaps. 2.000 or 3.000 pieces. Five or ten percent of that mail will come back to you because of a wrong address. The Post Office Department has had to handle it. It has cost them money to handle it and to send it back. You correct the address and you send the mail back again. Again the Post Office Department has to handle it and the chances are that 5 percent or 10 percent of that batch will come back. and the same thing happens on every batch of big mail that you send out. The Post Office Department will have to handle one piece of mail not once and not twice but sometimes three times. That is what costs money. This box holder address will absolutely do away with that. I suggest that this makes sense and I hope you give us a \"yea\" vote on this motion.",

By abandoning their passenger service the railroads are. I feel. not only hurting the traveling public but. in the long run. are hurting themselves by destroying one important segment of the transportation industry. In recent years we have seen passenger service on many railroads go steadily downhill. Fewer and fewer trains are available to the traveling public. People are discouraged from using the passenger trains which are available. and the vicious circle grows worse. I have introduced a bill. H.R. 9568. aimed at correcting this situation. Another example of just why my bill was introduced is carried in an editorial in the Falls City (Nebr.) Journal This editorial touches upon both the needs of the people served and the potential harm which can come to the railroad and its stockholders. A525 The editorial follows: The State railway commission Friday authorized the Burlington railroad to discontinue passenger service on its line between Lincoln and St. Joseph. Mo. It was a sad day for us in Falls City. Salem. Dawson. Humboldt and Rulo. But it must have been an even sadder day for the Burlington railroad. While the ending of the passenger service will leave Salem. Dawson. Humboldt. and Rulo without any passenger trains. the loss actually wont damage anything but their pride. But they soon will get used to itjust as they previously got used to the passing of the ox team. the grocers delivery wagon and the horse and buggy. For the Burlington. the situation is different. It cant go on indefinitely destroying its business in the name of economy and cost cutting. Yet that is the path some railroads are following. it seems to us. Feed Grain Plan",

The democratic Ukrainian Republic which was established in 1918 was indeed a landmark in that nations long and bitter struggle against czarist and Russian rule. It is tragic that this candle of liberty was so quickly to be stamped out by Soviet oppression and brutality. Yet. despite all the suffering and hardship. the Ukrainian people have shown great strength and resourcefulness. and their desire for liberty burns as fiercely as ever in their hearts. That this spirit of liberty can still burn so brightly. in spite of the cruel oppression. executions. purges. and deportations. should be noted by people everywhere. To those of us who are free and secure. the flame of Ukrainian liberty should give us strength in the heavy burden of defending freedom in its most perilous hour. To those who are among the new and independent nations. the evidence of Soviet colonialism and tyranny in the Ukraine and other captive nations should well reveal the mockery which the A533 Soviets make of such pure words as selfdetermination. democracy. and freedom. And for those who are living under the cloak of dictatorship. let the spirit of freedom still flaming in Ukrainian hearts give evidence to the old adage that man was made to live in freedom and not in slavery. I would like to join my colleagues in noting the anniversary of Ukrainian independence and reminding the captive peoples everywhere that we in America do not accept their slavery as final. that we are confident that freedom will again shine in their lands. and that they will take their place. as is their Godgiven right. among the community of sovereign nations.

Their freedom lasted only from 1918 until 1920 when it was snuffed out by the forces of Soviet Russian totalitarianism. Since then this conquered land has been a constant reminder of Soviet imperialism and disregard for the nationalistic sentiments of the peoples that border the Soviet state. The experience of the Ukrainian nation manifests the hyprocisy of Soviet claims to be the champion of national selfdetermination and the advocate of freedom for all peoples that live under colonial rule. The American people. throughout their history. have been true advocates of freedom for captive peoples. The continued growth of democracy in America is influenced by our defense of freedom elsewhere in the world. If Americans ever close their ears to the cries of others who call out in the name of liberty they will also become insensitive to the threats to individual liberty that might arise in their own communities. Let us pray that this shall never happen because the defense of individual liberty and national selfdetermination are part of the very heart of the democratic faith which we all affirm.

I am most anxious to Join many of my colleagues in the House in commemorating the 44th anniversary of the independence of the Ukraine. which was attained in January 1918 but has been lost to these brave people under the tyrannical heel of the Soviet Communist Government for many. many years. The fact is obvious that we do not have to go beyond the Soviet Unions own borders to find people who are truly enslaved. Thus. for these many years. the Ukrainians have been a \"captive nation\" within the Russian borders. and the leaders in the Kremlin are well aware of the restless spirit and the great desire for liberty which smoulders unsatisfied in the hearts of the people of the Ukraine. I think it is right that we Americans should point up to the world the fact that the people of the Ukraine are enslaved. Khrushchev and his cohorts behind the Iron Curtain do not like to be reminded that all is not well in their own backyard. our reminding them of their misdeeds is a positive stroke in gaining the offensive in the cold war. and we should do so at every opportunity.

What justification is there for his saying that we overestimate their evil? 5. What justification is there for his saying that we should not dismiss the words of Soviet leaders as lies because most of the time what they say is close to what they think? 6. What justification is there for White in his recent public statement. leaving the clear implication that the differences in relative moral standing between Soviet Russia and the United States are only of degree and listing our U2 flights and our attempts to help Cuban freedom fighters as proof that we are not unlike the Reds? 7.

I rise to address myself to the sectin appearing on page 10 of the bill which deals with the program of assistance to Cuban refugees and to the reasons of the committee noted in its report for taking the action on pages 27 and 28 of the report. Mr. Chairman. this cut made by the committee amounts to 21 percent. The specific reasons assigned in the report for the cut are that the administrations request for the care of unaccompanied refugee children is too high. and ought to be reexamined. and therefore a cut of $15.110.000 was made on a $70 million request. The total amount of money in the budget request for care of unaccompanied refugee children was $13.8 million. By no calculation or through any manner of arithmetic. logic. or otherwise. could you in any way justify the cut or save that amount of money unless you did away with the care of refugee children. Mr. Chairman. 42 percent more funds are allowed in this bill over last year. but we also have 106 percent more Cuban refugees. I think you will pardon a personal reference when I say that I have to live with this problem. because most of the refugees are in the congressional district which it is my honor to represent. I must compliment all the Catholic church groups. the welfare agencies. the citizens. and the public units for having done what I believe can be documented as an outstanding job in dealing with this problem of Cuban refugees. I take great pride in the fact that we have done as well as we have in meeting the problem of Cuban refugees which finally has been recognized as a national problem. The committees admonition has been noted. the figures have been reexamined. and I will put all of this information into the RECORD.

My proposed amendment would dovetail with the provisions of the Military Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951known as the Battle Actwhich makes it mandatory to stop any kind of assistance to any nation which knowingly allows sales of arms to the Soviet bloc. Under this amendment use of a nations vessels to carry strategic materials would be treated similarly to sale of military goods. According to press releases 60 cargo vessels are scheduled to deliver military shipments to Cuba. Official information with regard to such ships is classified but from newspaper accounts it is obvious that the vessels of our allies. under NATO. are transporting these shipments. At least one ship from West Germany. Greece. and Italy have already been used to carry military goods to Cuba and also an unspecified number from Great Britain. That our allies are assisting the Soviet Union to build up the military potential of the CommunistCastro regime in Cuba is unthinkable. In the Department of Commerce. in connection with the Export Control Act. there is a list known as the \"positive\" list. This list contains what are known as presumptionfordenial items against exports to the Communist countries. Validated licenses must be obtained from our Government for export of commodities on this list to all destinations except Canada. My amendment would limit funds appropriated so that they would not be available for assistance to a country which permits its vessels to transport presumed strategic items for military purposes. This amendment would implement and encourage our allies to ban the use of their cargo ships for transport of Communist military arms and special military implements of war to Cuba as long as it is under the Communist Castro regime.

It expresses similar views to those advanced by the President. But. my colleagues. the resolution and many of the suggestions advanced are only statements. They offer no real practical solution to the problem which confronts us. The most practical solution to that problem has been offered by the gentleman from Texas . It presents a very real method of keeping those nations who accept our aid from permitting the carriage by their ships of materiel which Castros Cuba needs. Castro will fall in time if he does not receive help from other nations. Mr. Chairman. I supported the other amendments offered which seek to deal with this matter. but in my humble opinion. and desirable as these amendments may be. they do not go far enough.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the purpose of this amendment is to retain U.S. control over the contracting and the precontracting procedures of capital projects that are financed through the foreign aid program. Two months ago a policy was enunciated by the AID Agency under which a capital project. which means a project in excess of $100.000. would no longer be subject insofar as its contracting and precontracting procedures were concerned. that is. the engineering studies. architectural studies. and the actual letting of the contract. to the supervision of the Agency itself. In other words. as a result of this policy. all these procedures would be left to the grantee or the beneficiary country and the AID Agency would only have a postcontractual supervision over these capital contracts in excess of $100.000. The policy statement was that AID will administer these projects by controlling and monitoring the use of the funds rather than by direct involvement in the contracting. engineering. procurement. and construction procedures. These arrangements would be made by the borrower or grantee directly with the firm it would select to do the particular work in question. The thrust of the policy would be to place responsibility upon the recipient country and not to retain it in the U.S. AID Agency. It seems to me. Mr. Chairman. that we have had sufficient difficulty up to now with capital contracts in which we have retained control. we have seen numerous instances of negligence. of misfeasance. and of criminality and these have occurred under U.S. control. Therefore. I suggest this is not a time to change this policy. And the purpose of my amendment. Mr. Chairman. is to reinstate control by our Government of these vital contracting procedures. Without this supervision we could have a global fiscal free lunch counter such as we have never seen before.",

    "speech": "This amendment would stop this policy which. if it goes into effect. would permit these foreign countries. using their somewhat loose procurement practices. to spend our money. and to find out how they did it. we would have to ask the questions of a foreign official. because all the AID people would tell us is. \"We do not have anything to do with that any more. We let the recipient take care of the contracts on these projects.\" This new policy would defy the Committee on Appropriations. the Foreign Affairs Committee. and the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Government Operations and deprive them of the opportunity to find out how the money is spent. because our officials would say. \"We are no longer responsible for it.\"",
