    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to express my strong support for this nomination. Throughout his testimony before the Finance Committee and during private meetings. Mr. Kantor has impressed me as a man of enormous integrity and ability. The post of U.S. Trade Representative is one of the most important posts in the administration. It is also one of the most difficult. The U.S. Trade Representative is charged with conducting literally dozens of complex international trade negotiations covering dozens of topics and involving hundreds of nations. The USTR is also charged with winning congressional approval for trade agreements and trade legislation as well as coordinating trade policy with the private sector. And all of these tasks must be accomplished with the help of a professional staff of about 125. Mr. Kantor is likely to log nearly tens of thousands of air miles and spend months overseas each year. Mr. Kantor and his family will be making some heavy sacrifices. But those sacrifices could open markets for billions of dollars worth of new U.S. exports and create tens of thousands of new American jobs. If he does his job welland I believe he will do his job very wellMr. Kantor could create more jobs and have a greater impact on American incomes than any other Cabinet member. I congratulate President Clinton on this superb choice. As chairman of the Finance Committees International Trade Subcommittee. I look forward to working with Mr. Kantor and the rest of the new administrations international trade team. Working together. we can help build a better economy and quality of life for every American.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to say a few words of commendation regarding the nomination of Alice Rivlin to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. A phrase that has come into vogue in Washington in recent times has been the characterization of some individuals as \"deficit hawks\"-people who press for deficitreduction as the single most important issue that we face. one that must be addressed immediately. even to the shortterm detriment of some other policy goals--because no other policy goal can be ultimately met if we do not achieve this one. Alice Rivlin has a reputation of being particularly zealous on the deficit issue. and it is my earnest hope that she will add to that reputation during her service with the new administration. During her time with the Brookings Institute. and with the Congressional Budget Office. she has repeatedly stressed the need for deficit reduction. and has been unstinting in her descriptions of the politically difficult actions that are necessary to do that. Ms. Rivlin is one of the coauthors of the \"Strengthening of America\" report with which I was involved this past yearthat report spells out very clearly in what direction this country is going if we do not. very quickly. begin to face up to our Federal fiscal situation. I therefore applaud her appointment. She is a splendid choice and a splendid person. And I urge my colleagues to confirm as I know they will.",

I was particularly and personally pleased to hear of Congressman PANETTAS nomination. He is one fine person. I have always admired him greatly. Prior to the time of the nomination. there was a great amount of speculation in the media about whether the new President would seek to focus on new \"investment\"-that is. new Government spendingor whether he would be willing to direct a serious assault on the deficit. Selecting LEON PANETTA. someone who has been very honest \"up front\" and outspoken about the need to reduce the deficit. sent a powerful signal that I personally found to be very positive. During LEON PANETTAS time here in Congress. he would frequently share information with the rest of the Congress about what kinds of difficult steps would be necessary to conscientiously and seriously address the deficithe was never one to posture. but rather he would produce various scenarios. with examples of the kinds of programs that would have to be cut if we were to make any serious progress on the deficit. So this fine man knows exactly what is requiredindeed. he knows better than most in Washington do. After Congressman PANETTAS appointment. President Clinton said that he would give the new OMB Director a \"chance to teach me some math.\" I sincerely hopeand I fully expectthat Congressman PANETTA will be ever forthright and truthful in his analyses of just what ki ds of spending cuts will need to be made if we are to ever recapture control of the Federal budget.",

EPAs responsibilities have increased greatly over the years without any real increase in funding. Environmental problems have become more complex and more technical. The easy problems have been solved. Now we are dealing with the more difficult and contentious issues. I have met with Ms. Browner and learned she has had a good deal of experience in being a regulator and she will surely find this experience to be most useful in her new endeavor. Regulating is never easy. It requires the balancing of competing interests while keeping the goal of environmental protection and the state of the national economy in mind. Among the many challenges the new EPA Administrator will face is the need to revamp the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program. Now there is a real challengel The existing Superfund Program is simply not doing the job it was designed to do. I know Carol Browner wants to revitalize that program and Congress Is going to have to pitch in and help. We need to look hard and closely at the current system of strict. joint. and several liability. among other things. Municipal waste. funding for wastewater projects. enforcement. safe drinking water standards and testing requirements. indoor air pollution. implementation of the Clean Air Act. and many other regulatory issues will be simmering along as the new Administrator taken office. I believe Carol Browner will be able to \"hit the ground running.\" I was impressed with her experience and credentials and I think she will take into account the different problems which different regions of the country face. I also think she understands the special needs of rural areas and small communities. EPA should not treat these areas in the same manner as the huge metropolitan areas are treated. I am also aware that she knows the importance of taking economic considerations into account and I find that most heartening. As she herself has said so well on previous occasionsthe economy is the number one problem for Congress and the administration today. I look forward to working with Ms. Browner in her new capacity as EPA Administrator.",

President Clinton has made an excellent choice in selecting this decorated Vietnam combat veteran to head the second largest agency in the Federal Government. Certainly Jesse Brown brings a wealth of personal and professional experience to the job. Jesse Brown enlisted in the Marine Corps shortly after graduating from high school in Chicago. Wounded in Vietnam. he went to work for the Disabled American Veterans in 1967. In the past 24 years. he has served with distinction rising from National Service Officer in Chicago to executive director of DAVs Washington headquarters. In the period following the announcement of his nomination. I was pleased to see a series of stories in various newspapers regarding Mr. Brown. the headlines of which described him as a \"defender of the rights of veterans.\" a \"master of regulations.\" a \"warrior\" in fighting for veterans benefits and \"harddriving.\" Those are valuable qualities to bring to the challenges he faces as the new Secretary. First and foremost. he takes over a healthcare system whose medical programs. operations. and expertise are wide ranging and extensivewith more than 200.000 employees. hundreds of hospitals. clinics. nursing homes. and domiciliaries and an annual budget of $15 billion. It will take considerable effort and attention to restore the systems ability. which has been compromised over the past decade. to provide firstclass medical care to Americas veterans. But. I know the new Secretary will be up to the challenge in this area. as well as the others facing him. We want him to succeed as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. For we share a common goal. to see to it that those benefits earned by veterans through their service to this country are provided them in an efficient. fair. equitable. and costeffective manner.

He was the first among Southern Governors to recognize his State could compete in the future for highwage jobs only if all youngsters received better preschool educational and nutritional services. Richard Riley in 1984 forced through a comprehensive $200 million reform plan that included rigorous standards and an evaluation program for all public schools that remains in place today.

This is an attempt to bring it down to last years level. It provides one other thing. It does put the $20 million back in to reestablish the Selective Service System. This bill. if we do not touch it. will add more than $2 billion to the national debt above what we had last year. The American people are crying for reduction in expenditures. Over the past 2 weeks.

Mr. SKEEN. who unfortunately cannot be with us today and Mr. MYERS for so ably taking Mr. SKEENS place. I commend them for crafting a very fair and balanced bill. The bill provides roughly $56.2 billion for mandatory domestic food programs such as food stamps and farm program crop subsidies. In addition. it provides roughly $14.4 billion in spending authority for discretionary programs. This amount represents a $303 million increase over fiscal 1993 funding. but it remains $248 million less than the subcommittees 602(b) allocation and $160 million less than the amount the President requested. I am very pleased that the subcommittee has placed priority on the WIC Program and rural water and sewer programs. Under this bill WIC is increased by $350 million and rural water and sewers by $200 million. I have always been a strong supporter of the WIC Program. This special supplemental food program for women. infants. and children provides critical nutrition and health benefits to lowincome pregnant women and young children. These benefits reduce infant mortality. avert premature births and help our needy children reach their full potential. To those of us who represent rural areas. the increase for rural water and sewers is very important. These programs help improve the quality of life of those who live and work in rural areas. I am also glad that the bill includes funding for full time equivalents for the Food and Drug Administration. I am hopeful that the Commissioner will use this funding to support at least 65 FTEs for the implementation of the Mammography Screening Act as he recommended earlier. As a breast cancer survivor. I know the importance of accurate testing for this devastating disease. Because there is no cure for breast cancer. we must do all we can to provide an accurate and responsible method of diagnosing this disease.

Inevitably. there will always be some differences between the authorizing committee and tile Appropriations Committee. and those differences I am confident we can work through. but the basic thrust of what the Committee on Appropriations has done is consistent with the budget resolution. consistent with the action of the committee on agriculture. and I think will move this committee forward as well as making significant progress on our Federal budget deficit. As the chairman of the House Committee on Agricultures Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities. I want to draw special attention to the contributions that American farm workers and ranchers are making towards deficit reduction in the context of this appropriations bill and the overall budget resolution. While the overall agricultural appropriations bill will increase spending for food programs in particular. which are now the lions share of the agricultural budget. the Food Stamp Program going up in excess of $7 billion. consistent with the Mickey Leland Child and Hunger Relief Act. WIC funding going up. other nutrition programs going up. but in fact that share of the budget that goes to farmers in the form of farm program payments of every kind is going to be going down by $2.95 billion. a huge decrease. over the next 5 years. I think we need to keep in mind the context. as well. that this comes on the heels of a 13 plus reduction in farm program spending mandated by the 1990 budget agreement. Over the last number of years that share of the agricultural budget. always relatively small compared to the entire budget. has been on a rapid decline. and continues to be so. It is important that our colleagues understand that and give full credit to the farm and ranch community for the contributions they are making. Obviously. our first priority is to find savings that have the least impact on direct farm income. That is difficult to do. We have crafted cuts that minimize the hit to farm income. but nonetheless there are consequences.",

I rise to express my strong support for H.R. 2493. and in particular for the funding provided in the bill for the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women. Infants. and Children. A recent study suggests that. in my own State of Florida. 114 more infant deaths would have occurred had the WIC Program not been in place. It is clear that WIC saves lives and gets babies off to a healthier start. This is a Federal program that works. It should be our goal to reach as many WICeligible women as possible. and H.R. 2493 marks an important step toward full funding of WIC. Mothers or motherstobe should not go without help because of a lack of funds. I am pleased that the President has given this program a high priority. and I commend the committee for increasing WIC funding by $350 million. I urge all my colleagues to save more lives by supporting this bill. Vote for healthier mothers and babies.",

We have a great need to cooperate and to work together between the authorizing committee and the appropriating committee to do what is best for agriculture. We need to come together on a nonpartisan basis. and we can do that. and have proven we can do that in the area of agriculture. Agriculture is our basic industry in this country. We take it for granted because it is so strong and so productive. But we need to do things to make agriculture more productive. and I think this bill does that. We have to protect our agricultural industry so that we bring new. young members into it. And by the research and some of the programs involved in this appropriation committee we will be able to do that. American agriculture is the best in the world. What we have to do is to be sure that we keep it that way. and we keep it strong and competitive with our competitors around this world.",

CHAIRMAN: I appreciate your support this morning in opposing the amendment that would have permitted the Secretary of Agriculture to make retroactive payments to farmers who suffered crop losses from 1990 to 1992 in order to receive payments up to 100 percent of their eligible claims. That amendment would have increased the cost of disaster payments by $3.4 billion. It is my understanding that a compromise amendment may be offered which would eliminate the 50 percent pro rata for agricultural disaster payments for the 1993 crop losses. This amendment is estimated to add $1 billion in costs to the $1.4 billion crop disaster assistance program requested by the President and contained in the committee bill.

These funds will be available to help those who have lost their homes. property. and communities begin to rebuild their lives. Mr. President. I traveled to the Midwest with the President a few weeks ago. What I saw was devastating. Hundreds of homes submerged under water. millions of acres of cropland destroyed. community water systems contaminated. The damage is so widespread that President Clinton has declared nine States major disasters. We have been so pleased to see FEMA respond so quickly to this disaster. FEMA has been in every State. working handinhand with the National Guard troops and the Governors. We commend the new FEMA Director. James Lee Witte. for his good work. It has been heartwarming to see the American peoples good will shine during this calamity. Neighbors have helped neighbors. thousands of volunteers from across the country have filled sandbags. volunteer organizations like the American Red Cross have provided over a million meals to disaster victims. Now it is time for the Congress to respond to the devastation by ensuring that needed funds are available for recovery. Let me say. Mr. President. once the flood waters recede. we know the estimates on the damage will be revised. As chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee which funds FEMA. Im committed to doing everything I can to ensure that the fiscal year 1994 appropriation for FEMA disaster relief includes adequate funds for flood victims. Mr. President. while the rains continue in the Midwest. the Southeast has been stricken by drought. The drought has resulted in enormous crop loss up and down the east coast. So Im very pleased to note that the bill will also aid farmers in Southeastern States. In my own State. farmers on the Eastern Shore have lost many acres of corn and soybean. In closing.

The LRFA was created to preserve rail service to small towns and communities by providing financial assistance needed to rehabilitate lines that might otherwise be abandoned. I appreciate my colleagues prompt attention to the critical situation affecting an important segment of our transportation system. The need Is clear.

At least $8.5 million of Missouris railroad damage affects Gateway Western Railway. a regional railroad with 300 miles of track running between Kansas City. MO. and Roadhouse. IL. Ironically. Gateway Western. which is the hardest hit railroad in the Midwest. would be ineligible for assistance under the bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee because. last year. It carried slightly more freight per mile than the 5milliontonmile eligibility limit allowed. During the Appropriations markup. Senator LAUTENBERG. the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. indicated that he would be willing to consider an amendment to ensure that railroads like Gateway Western receive the help they need. The amendment that I am offering. Mr. President. would replace the Senate language with the rail assistance provision included in the Housepassed emergency flood relief bill. Briefly stated. the amendment provides assistance to repair and rebuild rail lines damaged by the flood. Through the LRFA. $11 million would be available for smaller nonclass I railroads. that carried 5 million gross ton miles or less per mile during the previous year. and $10 million would be available for other railroads. including Gateway Western. at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the city of San Bernardino. CA. located in my district. police tell me that 1.814 cases of domestic violence were reported in 1993. That is an average of over five cases of domestic violence in one city of my district in just 1 day. In the city of Fontana. there were 1.157 reported incidences of domestic violence last year. In this city where 16 homicides occurred within that period. 2 of them were a result of domestic violence. Police in the neighboring city of Rancho Cucamonga report 295 such crimes. Colton reports Something is wrong. The national statistics of domestic violence are astounding and appalling to me. But when I hear these numbers from my own district. the impact is tenfold. Even more disturbing is to realize that these are just reported cases--the majority of women. men. and children opt to suffer silently. afraid or ashamed to come forward. Unfortunately. a tragic generational cycle is perpetuated as children grow up In homes where they are abused and become abusers themselves. In addition to the physical and emotional devastation experienced by victims of domestic violence. another grave facet of this epidemic is its burden on the criminal justice system. The cost in terms of resources and manhours Is immense. Police in my district tell me domestic violence calls are particularly unstable and dangerous because of the intensity of such situations. Many involve cases of alcohol or drug abuse and use of weapons such as guns. knives. and clubs. A large majority of the perpetrators are booked. but most return to their families and are repeat offenders. We must take action. We need to create policies and provide resources that facilitate the working together of health care and social workers. law enforcement officers. the courts and governments to overcome domestic violence. The violence against women provisions included in the crime bill will begin to do this. But it is not enoughit is just a start. We need to offer alternative means of support for victims so that a life without their abusers is possible. We need tougher laws that effectively punish and reform abusers and protect victims of abuse when they seek help and justice.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Democrats in the White House and on the House floor have contended that the Republican contract with America jeopardizes Social Security. What complete utter and irresponsible nonsense. Mr. Speaker. the contract with America contains the 10percent debt buydown concept. Debt buydown is an implementation strategy for a balanced budget. and it works. According to the Congressional Budget Office. Mr. Speaker. under optimal circumstances. using taxpayer designation of their tax money to a special debt buydown fund. and then applying those savings to spending cuts. balances the budget in 6 years. Here is the important point: Debt buydown works without touching Social Security. In fact Social Security is specifically and totally exempt from debt buydown spending cuts. So. Mr. Speaker. the Congressional Budget Office has certified a balanced budget implementation strategy that exempts Social Security and works. That makes everything that the Democrats are saying about a Republican attack on Social Security so much political nonsense.",

South Africas was the overthrow of apartheid. The sporadic violence that attended both cannot detract from the ultimate triumph of human rights over war and fratricide. We are in good company today as President Nelson Mandela comes to Washington. South Africa now needs to solidify its revolution. This requires continuing U.S. aid and especially investment from U.S. companies. Ten years ago I did not expect to be an advocate of aid and trade with South Africa. In 1984. along with three others. Mr. Speaker. we entered the South African Embassy and helped light the spark that led to sanctions. Today the call for divestment has been turned on its head with a market economy and a nonracial economy. South Africa is marching forward.

BRAC 1993 is not funded. and the military is having to take it out of hide. BRAC 1995 is to look at the true environmental cleanup cost and the cost before we close the base. If there is no savings. then that will add to national security. Social spending in the crime bill is nothing compared to that in the defense bill. That will help. Stop taking peacekeeping dollars out of a needed defense budget. Procure equipment on economy of scale: 28 aircraft that we bought this year has astronomical unit costs. stay out of the battles like Somalia. Bosnia. and Haiti. all billions of dollars.

This year. domestic violence victims across the country can find hope in the fact that after years of effort. the Federal Government has finally responded to the problem of domestic violence by enacting the Violence Against Women Act as part of the crime bill. For too long. people have tolerated the belief that beating your wife is somehow more acceptable than beating up a total stranger. But. finally. the Congress and the President have acted to stem the violence by passing the Violence Against Women Act. The act authorizes funding for a national. tollfree hotline to provide information and assistance to victims of domestic violence. it creates a Federal remedy for interstate stalking and abuse. it requires that each State honor the protective orders issued by other States. it encourages comprehensive reform in arrest. prosecution and judicial policies directed toward domestic violence. it provides substantial funding for battered womens shelters. and it permits immigrant spouses of United States citizens to escape from their abusive spouses without risking deportation.

Could it be a Clinton plan that created 59 new Federal agencies and expanded the authority of 20 others? Could it be that the ClintonGephardt and ClintonMitchell plans were job killers and tax raisers? Could it be that the more the American people knew about these plans the less they liked? Could it be that senior citizens did not want their benefits cut and their costs increased? Maybe as the Democrat leadership leaves Congress they should find time to do two things: First. take a math course to learn that 178 Republicans dues not equal half of 435. and Second. spend more time with the American people who will tell him why threefourths of them did not like Clintonstyle health care reform proposals.",

And it is going to make it assured rather than doubtful that they will be paying a significant amount of money. perhaps amounting to billions of dollars. to the Federal Government in exchange for these pioneer preferences. As the matter originally came forth from the Federal Communications Commission. these licenses were going to be given for nothing. Because of the efforts of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and because of the cooperation of the FCC. an attempt has been made to administratively raise this to 90 percent of the cost. In point of fact. this raises some question because of the doubtful authority of the commission to do so. Now we are having to do this matter by legislation. Do not listen to this kind of falsehood.

We have made solid progress in addressing this problem with the passage of the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act. Provisions of this legislation include requiring interstate enforcement of protection orders and strengthening services for victims of domestic and genderbased violence. Fortunately for the people of Wisconsin. we have a solid cluster of centers that provide quality services for their victims. The people in my congressional district are taking steps to address this serious problem. On October 14. a speakout and candlelight vigil will be held to end domestic and sexual violence at the Kenosha County Courthouse in Kenosha. WI. Additionally. the YWCA alternatives to domestic violence in Janesville. WI. and Walworth County. has been working for many years to combat domestic violence in our society.

Many victims of domestic violence remain in the shadows. All too often our police and other law enforcement officials cannot help until the woman is seriously injured or killed because the victims are silenced by fear. What can we do as a Congress to stop the violence? First of all. we can raise awareness and let women know that help is available. Second. we can break the cycle of abuse. by teaching our children that the use of violence Is not justifiable. Lastly. let us not forgetthat the victim is the abused. not the abuser.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. after 4 hours of Republican rhetoric. I think it is still a fair question to ask our friends on the other side of the aisle. what is your real problem with this bill? Surely it cannot be retroactivity. when most Republicans voted for President Reagans 1981. 1984. 1986 retroactive tax provisions. President Fords 1976 Tax Reform Act increased the alternative minimum tax by 50 percent. and yet when it passed in October it was retroactive to the previous January. Certainly it cannot be out of concern for small businesses. when you know that as many as 90 percent of tho small businesses in this country could see their taxes cut as much as five different ways. It cannot be out of concern for a 4.3 cent gasoline tax. when by shopping around between service stations you can save more than 5 cents. Even if you do not shop around. we are only talking about $30 a year for the average household. And surely it cannot be because it hurts the elderly with incomes over $44.000. Your plan would have cut much more from health care for the elderly. -D 07 Vol. 139 (. 13)44 and not to mention military and civilian retirement pay. It cannot be because it balances budget cuts with tax increases. President Bush understood the need for balance. In fact. most of the Republicans on this side voted for that balanced deficit reduction bill. and In fact it did reduce potential deficits by up to $500 billion. And it cannot be because it affects only those with incomes over $180.000 instead of the middle class. I think the real reason is because it took a Democratic President to do what a Republican President did not have tho guts todo to act fiscally responsible.",

It is interesting the way language evolves. Government spending has come to be a very unpleasant phrase for people on the other side to some extent. that some Government spending is a big mistake. I have tried to reduce some of it myself. But some Government spending seems to me to be quite necessary. and I think. when we reach a point where there is an undifferentiated attack on anything that is called Government spending. we are making a big mistake. One of the significant increases. and it is an increase. in Government spending in this bill is a $20 million increase in something known as the earned income tax credit. and the fundamental premise of that proposal is this: If you are working. and because you are in such a lowwage job because of your own lack of skills. historically. because imports have depressed the wage level in the area In which you work. if you are a fulltime worker. and you have got a family. and you are under the poverty line because the wages you get for that 40hour week are so low. we are going to. if we pass this bill. bring you out of poverty. This is not a benefit for people on welfare. many of whom are quite deserving. It is not a benefit for people who do not work. It is not even a benefit for the unemployed. It is a benefit solely. and it is a $20 million spending increase. those bad words. but one. I would hope.

Mr. Speaker. let us set the record straight on retroactivity. First of all. if you have under $180.000 a year in family incomethat is right. $180.000 a yearyou do not have a dog in this fight. This does not apply to you. In fact. those who will be paying. the 1 million people who will be paying back to January 1 of 1993. are those whose average incomes are $300.000 per year. Second. what is not being revealed in all this campaign of folderol around here is that the tax cuts. as well as the tax increases on those making over $180.000 per year. are retroactive. 14 of them. including repealing the luxury tax. increasing small business expensing. restoring some passive loss for real estate. and favorable alternative minimum tax treatment. And. yes. 90 percent of small businesses in this country will benefit from these provisions. including the retroactive tax cut provisions. Mr. Speaker. what is also not told is how the people who will be subject to this liability. those earning over $180.000 per year. have 3 years to pay. without interest and without penalty. that increased liability. Finally. there have been retroactive provisions in the past. Since 1976 there have been five tax bills with 15 provisions. all made retroactive. The Reagan Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 had nine provisions alone. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 had retroactive provisions dealing with investment tax credits. Finally. in 1982. when they retroactively taxed 5.3 million drawing unemployment benefits. Mr. Speaker. let us set the record straight on retroactivity.",

So I am going to ask the middleincome taxpayers to do their own calculations to see how they are impacted by the taxes in this proposal. I think they will find the Clinton tax proposal. the Deficit Reduction Act. is a fair proposal. On income taxes. if you as an individual have taxable Income under $115.000. you do not pay any new taxes. If you are a couple with taxable income under $140.000. no new income taxes. That equates to about $180.000 of income. And unless you make $250.000 of taxable income. you are not subject to the 10percent surtax. So 98 percent of our income taxpayers are not going to pay any new income taxes. On the Medicare tax. if your salary from one employer is not over $135.000. you are not going to pay any more taxes. On Social Security. seven out of eight elderly who receive Social Security are not going to pay any more taxes. If your income is below $44.000 as a couple or $34.000 as an individual. you do not pay any more taxes. The gasoline tax is the only broadbased tax. For people in Maryland on average that will mean an extra $28 a year. There is also the earned income tax credit offering people with $28.000 a year or less in income tax rebates. Mr. Speaker. when you add it up. 80 percent of the taxes come from people who make over $200.000 a year. All of the new taxes go for deficit reduction. along with the spending cuts.

The 1993 tax and spend plan Is even worse than 1990. The taxes are retroactive. Money earned between January 1. 1993 and today will be taxedeven though most of it has been spent or budgeted. This tax plan Includes a gas tax which will hurt anyone who drives a car. uses any form of transportation. or buys any product that Involves shipping.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. small business people of America. please take note. We salute you. We respect you. We know that you are the engine creating the growth of this economy and jobs for Americans. That is why this bill includes unprecedented incentives for you. You are going to be able to expense out. during the first year. $17.500 of new equipment purchases. rather than $10.000 under current law. You will be the beneficiary of investments induced by a new capital gains tax cut to 50 percent for investments in small firms. a provision that has the NFIBs support. And we will extend the deduction of health insurance for selfemployed. All of that. not to mention the extraordinary importance and benefit to small business of lower interest rates and credit availability. The small business provisions in this bill have been subjected to false attacks that are shameless. What is the truth about the impact of the tax provisions on small business? Four percent of small businesses in this countrythose with average incomes of over a half million dollars a yearwill be subjected to some Increased taxes. Ninety percent of small businesses will benefit from these incentives and be eligible for tax decreases. Finally. Mr. Speaker. let us remember to whom we are obliged as Representatives. I cannot state it better than was stated over 200 years ago by the great Irish parliamentarian from Bristol. Edmund Burke. who said to his constituents: It ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union with his constituents. * * * But his unbiased opinion. his mature judgment. his. enlightened conscience he ought not sacrifice to you. *** They are a trust from providence for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. * * * Your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment. and he betrays. insteadof serving you. if he sacrifices to your opinion. My colleagues. we owe America our best judgment. This bill serves the national interest. It is our earnest and difficult duty to support it.",

I was not a Member of this House in 1990. but I was an interested observer who heard the promises made by those. who cut the infamous 1990 budget deal. They are the exact same promises made today by the proponents of this bill. Tax now and well cut later. The fact is that raising taxes never reduces deficits. Rather. in a perverse way. they cause deficits to grow larger. The taxes in this plan will cost the people of my State of Massachusetts $7 billion over the next 5 years. These are resources that wont be available in my State to invest in new technologies. to create new Jobs. to send kids to college or to simply help a family make ends meet. This isnt change at all. It is the same old Washington. DO tax and dance routine. that will ultimately weaken our economy and sadly hurt real people. I urge a no vote on the tax plan.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong opposition to the taxandspend plan before the House today because I was sent to Congress by the people of western New York to reduce the staggering budget deficit by cutting spending first. Unfortunately. this plan raises taxes first and foremost. There are many families in Buffalo and Erie County who are struggling to make ends meet and cannot afford to pay new taxes on gas. There are many senior citizens in our area who cannot afford to pay new taxes on Social Security benefits. There are many small businesses in western New York that employ thousands of hardworking men and women and cannot afford to pay higher income taxes. Supporters of this budget claim the higher tax rates will only affect the richor those who earn over $180.000 a yearbut twothirds of those people are small businessowners who employ many of the working men and women in western New York. This tax plan does not hit just the richthe taxes also hit small businesses. the fastest growing sector of our economy that creates the most new jobs. By taxing the smallbusiness sector. Congress new gas taxes and income taxes will cost Jobs in Buffalo. Erie County. and the rest of the United States. The budget plan raises taxes first and promises to enact some savings in the socalled \"out years\"-the problem is that no one has ever lived in an \"out year.\" In fact. we are Just about to enter an \"out year\" from the 1990 budget deal in which spending outs are supposed to take effect. but Congress is preparing to scrap the deal and start again with a new tax increase. Instead of cutting spending first. the budget plan raises taxes first and postpones spending cuts--in fact. it even increases spending in many areas. Last election day. the people of Buffalo and Erie County. just like people across this country. sent a message to Washington that was loud and clearwe want a change. and a change for the better. This taxandspend budget is business as usual. Thats why I oppose it. and thats why I supported the Kasich alternative plan that would have reduced the budget by cutting spending firstnot raising taxes.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. let me first address myself to the comments of the gentleman from Pennsylvania . when I think he said words to the effect that this gas tax increase is a massive tax increase on the middle class. Let me remind everyone that this is 4.3 cents a gallon. For the average working family in America. it is about 70 cents a week. 70 cents a week dedicated to the twin goals of deficit reduction and getting this economy moving again. I think that is unreasonable to call it a massive tax increase on the middle class. I do not think it will wash. Most important. Mr. Speaker. I would like to show everyone this graph here which shows the hard freeze that this bill contains on what we call the domestic discretionary portion of the budget. Now. a hard freeze means that in the next 5 years there is going to be no increase for inflation of any kind. And Members can see from the graph here. the red line is what will happen if we do nothing. as we have for so many years in terms of allowing the domestic discretionary portion of the budget to drift upward. And the blue line is what is going to happen. if we enact this legislation. So we see there are considerable savings. and this difference. by the way. is enforced through a sequestration process. If Congress appropriates more than what this statute requires. that acrosstheboard cuts be made. So beginning today. for this and other reasons. looking for the 5year period that this bill incorporates. this is the largest deficit reduction package ever voted on by the House or the Senate.",

She has pointed the Agency in a new direction. From now on the CPSC will be proactive. not reactive. It will be innovative in its ideas and in the use of its resources. It will not wait for deaths and injuries from dangerous products to pile up by the score before acting. It will reach out to prevent as many of these tragedies as it can.

This month Anspach is celebrating its 60th anniversary. and this significant milestone of success and service to the community merits special recognition. Originally founded by Herman and Carolyn Anspach. the agency was formally incorporated in 1934. It is interesting that Herman Anspach didnt set out to establish a travel officehe was involved in real estate. although he later would become a founding member of the midwest chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents. But in the early 1930s. a significant part of Hermans business Was renting houses in the area to Chicago clients who wanted to escape the heat. crowds. and hectic pace of the city during the summer months. But many of the owners of those rental houses told Herman that they needed to plan their own summer vacations in order to make their homes available to his Chicago clientele. Herman suggested the idea of an ocean cruise. and it caught on. He started to help local residents make the arrangements for their cruises. and Anspach Travel was on its way. And what a long way it has come. From its modest beginnings. by the early 1970s Anspach had five fulltime agents serving hundreds of customers. In 1980. Henry and Cookie KohnHerman and Carolyn Anspachs soninlaw and daughterstarted to run the business and worked to expand the agency. building on Anspachs reputation of excellence. Today. Anspach Travel has almost 20 fulltime agents and serves thousands of clients throughout the United States. Mr. Speaker. Anspach Travel has maintained the highest standards of quality in all aspects of its operation and is a superb example of American small business achievement. I am proud to represent a congressional district that includes a firm of Anspachs caliber and I want to wish Henry and Cookie Kohn many more successful years.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as reauthorization of the Clean Water Act receives increased attention. this Member would like to stress the need for flexibility and local involvement before Congress mandates onesizefitsall solutions to water problems. Flexibility to meet the diverse conditions of this country should be the basic premise behind any clean water reauthorization bill. For example. Nebraska relies far more heavily on groundwater sources for beth drinking water and commercial uses than any other state. As a result. Nebraska has been a pioneer in the protection of groundwater and the management of its natural resources. As a result. Nebraska is the only State that has consolidated its specialpurpose natural resource areas into local political subdivisions. known as Natural Resource Districts. These NRDs. established on a watershed basis. have made significant progress in addressing nonpoint source pollution through local. voluntary. and incentivebased programs. Nebraska has also been a national leader in protecting groundwater through the use of Special Protection Areas as a means of preventing and controlling the contamination of groundwater. The program provides an excellent example of necessary coordination on the State and local level. To be successful. the Clean Water Act must avoid specifically mandating national solutions to the problems being addressed. As Nebraska has demonstrated. flexibility and -local involvement are the keys to success in achieving clean water.",

DON RIEGLE saw the light and switched to the Democratic party. Since then. we have been pleased to have such a forceful and dedicated legislator in our midst. Senator RIEGLES leadership on the Banking Committee has been excellent. He is regarded as intense and hardworking. and deserves much credit for the recently passed interstate banking bill. He enjoys a challenge. and perseveres rather than giving up in the face of adversity. His constituents have always been foremost in Senator RIEGLES mind. He has worked to ensure that American jobs are protected and that the American worker is not exploited. He is fair and levelheaded. DON RIEGLE has brought vision and initiative to the Senate that I know will be missed. I wish him well and thank him for his many contributions to this institution and our nation.",

Since 1976. he has been a strong voice for the interests of the people of Wyoming. and for the interests of the West in general. I have viewed Senator WALLOP as a member of the loyal opposition since I entered the Senate in 1980. From my perspective. he has been a little bit too effective in this role. working to stop or change legislation which I supported. But although we often disagree on policy matters. I certainly respect Senator WALLOPS courage of his convictions. He came to the Senate with certain views and beliefs. and he has held fast to them. Senator WALLOP has been a strong voice in foreign policy issues. advocating changes in policy even when they were not popular. He has never catered to public opinion polls. but rather has stuck to his guns and done what he believed to be right. I admire his tenacity and his perseverance.

This legislation addresses the critical growing shortage of affordable and decent housing for many of Americas neediest families and individuals. The purpose of this legislation is twofold: First. it seeks to encourage the developmnt and maintenance of affordable and decent housing for lowincome families by providing attractive investment Incentives to private investors willing to rehabilitate or construct lowIncome housing units. Second. the bill establishes sanctions against slum landlords to make permanent the lowincome housing tax credit while denying these credits to slumlords of lowincome rental units who consistently violate State and local health and safety building codes by maintaining substandard rental housing units. The bill would also provide Investment incentives to private developers to rehabilitate and construct new lowincome housing units through shortening the depreciation period. and exempts from the passiveloss limitation certain deductions relating to lowincome housing. Mr. Speaker. new construction of housing for low- and moderateincome families and Individuals Is at a virtual standstill. Scores of existing housing units will continue to disappear as older buildings are destroyed and replaced with higher priced rental units and condominiums. leaving millions of Americans without a decent place to live and perhaps throwing thousands of other families with children into the ranks of homelessness. The LowIncome Housing Revitalization Act is a step in the right direction towards combating this Nations unprecedented housing crisis. This legislation will go a long way in providing some assistance for the many who desperately need safe. affordable. and lowincome housing.

Our efforts. though commendable. fall short of what needs to be done to reach our recycling potential. because. unfortunately. not all of the product collected nationwide have markets. What we need is to create new uses for old goods. But. as of today. we lack the technological means to do this. I am introducing legislation that will encourage American entrepreneurs to develop innovative ways to recycle our dwindling resources. The Recycling Initiative Grant Act will provide Federal grants to support creation of innovative recycling techniques. At a total annual cost of $3 million. this program would be a costeffective way to encourage recycling. Each $100.000 grant to an individual. nonprofit or commercial organization. or locality will support development of new methods to separate. collect. reuse. market. or produce goods with recycled materials. This program will be authorized for 4 years and requires that grant recipients report to the EPA the final results of their projects. This necessary feedback should provide an Invaluable information base for other recyclers and help us work toward a comprehensive national recycling policy in the future. It is imperative that we find Innovative ways to market the resources we so dutifully recycle. and I urge my colleagues to support the Recycling Initiatives Grant Act.",

We can all agree with his statement. \"The fact is people are not taxed too little. the problem is the government spends too much.\" In the TEFFERA tax increase of 1982. Congress promised $3 In spending cuts for every $1 of tax increases. The Democraticcontrolled House gave the American people the tax Increases. but not the spending cuts. In fact we got $3 In spending Increases for every $1 of new taxes. Not only is this article sound political philosophy. it is sound reasoning based on experience. In 1982. 1984. 1986. and 1990. we were promised spending cuts with proposals for new taxes. But every time we get the new taxes. we get more spending and no cuts. That is what the liberals call change. More of the same old policy that has taxed and spent America into a $4 trillion dollar national debt. The Government must cut spending before it has the right to ask the American people for a tax increase. Until our Democraticcontrolled Government is sensitized to this fact. the hard working people of our country will continue to be stung by more taxes. more spending. and higher deficits.

The composition and responsibility of the FHLB System has changed dramatically over the past 60 years. Prior to the Financial Institutions Reform. Recovery. and Enforcement Act of 1989 [FIRREA]. the Federal Home Loan Bank Board served the thrift industry as a regulator. the Board. as an insurer [Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation]. and as a provider of fundsthe regional banks. FIRREA transferred the role of regulator to the Office of Thrift Supervision [OTS] and the role of insurer to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC]. Today the surviving FHLB System consists of 12 regional banks that provide loans to member savings and loans. commercial and community bankers. credit unions and insurance companies for the purpose of financing residential housing.

It is the only alternative we have today that balances our budget without annihilating our countrys and this bodys longstanding values. including our commitment to children. the elderly. and longterm investments in infrastructure and schools. This is an enforceable. accountable balanced budget amendment that honors these longstanding values. In addition to requiring a balanced budget by the President and the Congress by 2001. this amendment establishes a Federal capital budget modeled after the capital budgets used by States. permitting the Government to finance longterm capital investments such as roads and schools and requiring that these investments be paid for over their useful lives out of the operating sidenot smoke and mirrors. It permits for flexibility in times of emergency such as war and recession. but does not allow for deficit spending whenever threefifths of this body chooses to deficit spend. as the Stenholm amendment would. Finally. our substitute ensures the integrity of Social Security. This will put an end to the practice of using Social Security surpluses to mask the true size of the deficit and ensure the viability of the program for future generations. Mr. Chairman. this is a tough but responsible balanced budget amendment. It gets our fiscal house in order without crippling our economy. hurting future generations of Americans or placing this body in a legislative straitJacket. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to support the Wise/Price/ Pomeroy/Furse/Eshoo/Byrne substitute. It is simply the best alternative.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. I think. in reading the two amendments. it should be evident to any legislator serious about enforcing a balanced budget requirement that the only clear choice is the proposal offered by the gentleman from Texas . The alternative sponsored by the gentleman from West Virginia and others. while wellintentioned. falls short in many respects. I believe them to be wellintentioned in their desire to accommodate capital budgeting. It may be fine. It may be accommodated in many Statelevel balanced budget amendments. but it is not necessary at the Federal level. The only major construction activity at the Federal level today is the Interstate Highway Program. which is handled on a payasyougo basis. through our collection of gas tax revenues. There is no reason to believe any similar commitment by the Federal Government would be likely in the near future. And even if that were the case. certainly. those commitments could also be handled honestly within an annual budget. The amendment proposed by the gentleman from West Virginia also exempts the Social Security trust fund. I do not know of another constitutional amendment that makes reference to an existing law. Why would we want to make a constitutional amendment contingent on a preexisting law? Usually. we enact laws which flow from the constitutional principles. If we are exempting the Social Security trust fund. why not the highway users trust fund? Why not the airport trust fund? Why not many dedicated user fees for parks or for ports or for other Government services? If we exempt one. the rationale is just as logical to also exempt these others. And for those reasons. I think it is ridiculous to start down that path with any sort of exemptions. We ought to keep everything in the budget. We ought to make deficit spending the exception rather than the rule. The only way to do that honestly is with a threefifths vote of the Congress as contained in the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas. Any alternative with exemptions and which allows deficit spending by a 50percent vote in Congress is not a serious alternative. I urge rejection of this approach.",

I certainly agree with Thomas Jefferson. Mr. Chairman. I come from a State that has a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Almost everyone in here comes from such a State. In 1941 our budget was getting out of control. and we passed one during the debate at that time. Now. I have gone and researched this.

And the House and Senate approved a 5year freeze on discretionary spending at 1993 levels with no adjustments for inflation. Our efforts have yielded some results. The deficit for the fiscal year that begins October 1 will be $171 billion. according to the CBO. This will be the smallest Federal budget deficit in 6 years. the lowest percentage of the Nations economic output in 16 years. and for the first time since Harry Truman was President. the deficit is projected to decline for the third year in a row. This is good news. But it is not good enough. We currently have no plan to balance the Federal budget at any time in the future. Nor will there be one unless the House passes this amendment today. sends it back to the Senate for reconsideration. and on to the States for ratification. Let me be clear: This amendment by itself will not balance the budget. But it is a critical tool. a tool used successfully in 49 of the 50 States to help keep their budgets in balance. It is a financial management tool that we must now adopt. As Members of Congress we are the stewards of the publics money. We are charged with managing this important.-and scarceresource wisely.

Entitlements will increase by 41 percent over the next 5 years. This year. our budget deficit will be more than $300 billion. I support the balanced budget amendment offered by Congressman STENHOLM recognizing that it Is not a panacea. It will not lead to painless elimination of the national debt. Presidents will still have to submit their budgets and Congress will still have to formulate and vote on them. Members would continue to be accountable to their constituents for votes in support of spending reductions and tax increases necessary to comply with the balanced budget amendment. Only through proposing and voting for cuts in Federal spending will the administration and Congress put to rest 18 years of excessive budget deficits and a paralyzing national debt. Unfortunately. Congress is not making the tough votes necessary to eliminate the budget deticits.

This bill will not do any of these. The tax and spend package before us today will increase taxes on all Americans. it will delay any real spending cuts to some future date uncertain. andworst of allit will cost Americans their jobs. According to the Tax Foundation. the Btu tax alone will send more than 1.000 of my constituents to the unemployment office. They will be joined there by nearly 20.000 other Floridians who will lose their jobs just so this Congress can increase the pool of money it can spend. And lets be clear. When nearly half a million Americans lose their jobs due to this tax increase. it will not result in the kind of deficit reduction the other side claims. In the very first year of this plan. for every $20 In tax Increases. there will be just $1 in spending cuts. Mr. Chairman. the American people want us to cut spending first. Instead. they are now facing huge tax increases. many of which are retroactive to the first of this year. Mr. Clinton may very well be the first President who found a way to raise taxes on the American people even before his inauguration. And who will pay those taxes? Everyone. Not just the rich. Under President Clintons bill. a middleincome senior couple will see the taxes on their Social Security increase about $370. Even more disturbing is the fact that this money will not go to the Social Security trust fund. It is unfair to raise revenues on the backs of middleclass senior citizens and it is Irresponsible to put that money In the general fund. Finally.

This package contains the biggest tax increase in U.S. history. and the taxes are retroactive to the first of this year. This package punishes the elderly who have saved and invested for retirement. and those who choose to keep working beyond age 65. by making 70 percent more of their Social Security benefits subject to tax. And. because the income thresholds for this tax are not indeed for inflation. the number of seniors subject to the tax could double in just a few years. This package has Btu tax that will increase the cost of virtually everything produced in America. fueling inflation and destroying jobs. Your constituents want you to cut spending first. This package raises taxes first and promises that someday. someday. we will make some cuts. Your constituents want deficit reduction.

He deserves a chance to put his program into effect.\" Thats garbage. Bill Clinton was elected on promisespromises to cut the deficit in half in 4 years. Promises to cut taxes for the middle class. Promises to enact the lineitem veto. This bill today is not what Bill Clinton promised the American people. 6909 007 VoL 139 (It. 8) 37 Yes. indeed. Bill Clinton deserves a chance. He deserves a chance to live up to his own promises. And when he does that. then. I will give his program a chance and vote that way.",

And they did not expect that people. because they are Republican or Democrat. would decide that their party affiliation was more important than what affected the Nation and that we have one President at a time. No matter what anyone thought about the Reagan and Bush budgets. he depended on bipartisan support. And by God. he has got it. Any time we can find that we have an issue before this Congress and every Republican. to the man and woman. has decided that they would rather gridlock than to give the President a fair chance. then It means that this is a terrible day in our Nations history and a terrible day in this Congress. Can we believe that Just because a Member is a Republican that they do not want to help the working poor. that Just because they are Republican that they do not want to have people have Jobs? No. I think what it amounts to is that they cannot tax the rich and refuse to ignore the oil barons.",

Tax increases represent 81 percent of the Democrat package. which will raise the national debt $1.5 trillion over the next 5 yearsaccording to their own figures. The Democrat plan will Increase the deficit. destroy jobs. and stifle the economy just as it is struggling to recover.

As many as 610.000 jobs will be lost nationally because of the energy tax. according to the National Association of Manufacturers [NAM].

Northwest Airlines and Its 24.000 Minnesota jobs. will be put In serious jeopardy by the new energy tax. The energy tax Is a big hit on the middle class. The average family of four will see its energy bill go up by $425 a year. according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Middleincome families will be hit the hardestjust because the President and Congress refuse to cut spending. Mr. Chairman. we need to cut spending first. and that is exactly what the Kasich Republican plan does. It reduces the budget deficit by $352 billion in spending cuts over the next 5 yearsand without Increasing taxes. Congress must say no to the largest tax increase in American history and say no to the energy tax which will kill American jobs. Congress must cut spending first. Say \"yes\" to the Kasich substitute.",

They expect me not to vote as a Democrat or a Republican but on the basis of whether this bill will or will not create Jobs. This bill is a massive tax shift from the investing sector to the consuming sector. Through all the years I have sat on the Committee on Ways and Means. everyone has testified that we should encourage savings. We should encourage investing. And best of all. we should encourage longterm investing. Yet this bill takes more money than we have ever taken at any one time from the very sector that creates jobs. that invests in America. Have we lost our senses? In a period of prolonged economic weakness. why would we want to give to Government the very dollars that create jobs? Small business. tha bone and marrow of job creating. is holding on by its fingertips in my State of Connecticut. and those very small businesses that are the job creators in America are going to pay more energy taxes. not once. not twice. but three times: once to the Federal Government. once to the State government. and once to offset the increase in the local property taxes. because those taxes are going to rise as we pay more to heat every school building throughout the cities and towns of our Nation. And Medicare. every small business is going to pay higher Medicare taxes. Why? Because the majority would not even allow me to bring to the floor a bill that would have reduced Medicare expenditures responsibly. In the private sector. all but 5 percent belong to managed care plans. In Medicare. only 5 percent belong to managed care plans. And yet there was no support. not even the right to debate on the floor to bring that kind of costsaving proposal to Medicare. Instead. raise our taxes and particularly get those small businesses. because they are the Job creators of America.

What I would like to do is to talk not about myself. but I would like to talk to the freshmen. the great reform class. 25 percent of this whole body. and particularly the Democratic freshmen. if I may have the opportunity. I really have two things to say. First. I have to believe this. having been in business many years. I think the President is getting bad advice. I know he is getting bad advice on the handling of the debt. and as the Members know. 70 percent of our debt is in 5year or less shortterm bonds. and they are even shortening it. That is bad. On the operating side. what he says is. \"Please grow. and please invest. and please reemploy.\" but when we throw this tax in. and another one. which involves the health care on top of an economy that is trying to get off its knees. what does it do? It is paralyzed. It does not move. If the economy does not move and the volume drops. no amount of tax increases or cost cuts are going to make up any difference in the deficit. but that is my own view. It may not be the view of the Democrats. and particularly the freshmen Democrats. What is right for them may be different than what is right for me. However. I implore them to vote their own conscience. I had to when I came here as a freshman in 1987. I voted against aid to the Contras. I voted against my President. I was called to the White House. The Vice President. the Secretary of State. my party leaders asked me. I did what I thought was right.

Mr. Chairman. the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides a great opportunity for deficit reduction while at the same time. the bill provides great leadership in helping our urban communities. This bill facilitates firsttime employment for thousands of young adults who live in our cities. and promotes opportunities for enhanced job skills and employment because it extends the targeted jobs tax credit permanently and expands the credit to Include participants in schooltowork programs and residents of certain distressed areas. The bill increases opportunities for lowincome residents of our cities to find decent and affordable housing because it permanently extends the lowincome housing tax credit. It also expands this valuable program to increase its availability in the empowerment zones and enterprise communities that will be designated. The bill ensures that no American family with a fulltime worker would be below the poverty line because it expands and simplifies the earned income tax credit significantly. This bill provides tax incentives for people to invest in specialized small businesses. This will help companies attract muchneeded equity capital so that they can play a greater role in revitalizing the innercity economy. The bill provides for the establishment of empowerment zones and enterprise communities in our Nations most distressed areas. and targets tax incentives for businesses to locate in. and hire residents of. these areas.

Mr. Chairman. it had been my intention to offer an amendment to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from repairing any Coast Guard vessel in a shipyard owned and operated by the United States if the Secretary has solicited proposals to conduct the work from private shipyards. It has recently come to my attention that a shipyard owned and operated by the U.S. Government was competing with private U.S. shipyards for a Coast Guard repair contract. Since 1981. 60.000 shipyard jobs have been lost in this country. and more than 40 yards have closed. If that trend is to be reversed. this country must have a rational and comprehensive shipbuilding policy. To develop that policy. Chairman RON DELLUMS of the Committee on Armed Services and Members on both sides of the aisle and I have introduced the National Shipbuilding and Conversion Act of 1993 which will encourage Government agencies to work with the U.S. shipbuilding industry. not against them. My amendment was consistent with the goal of that act. and would prevent the Coast Guard from unfairly disadvantaging private shipyards with subsidized Government contracts. Mr. Chairman. I was informed this morning by the Coast Guard that they have revised their policy to act consistently with the intention of my amendment and that. therefore. the amendment is not necessary.

A young man grew up on the streets of Baltimore. playing basketball for Dunbar High School. In his senior year. he was accepted to attend Northeastern University. Even after several major basketball schools tried to recruit him. he stuck by his word and went to play for the Huskies. Then. in 1987. the Boston Celtics made him their first round draft choice. surprising many. except those who saw him play. He had reached for his dreams and had made them reality. He was going to play professional basketball for one of the most successful organizations in any sport. This was a quiet player. who began his career behind great Boston names. But when Larry Bird retired. he stepped forward in his own way. taking the lead of a team that many thought would go leaderless. He became an NBA AllStar in 1992. and this team captain was seen as the core of the New Celtic team. the future of the franchise. And yet the people who knew him knew he was much more than a great athlete. He married his college sweetheart in 1987. and in 1992 became a father. He was just beginning a wonderfully successful career and the best years of his life were ahead of him. Then last year. during the playoffs. he collapsed during the first half. missed the rest of the series and had to watch from the sidelines as Boston was eliminated. But he was determined to come back. He wanted to play the game he had always loved. a game he played so well. On Tuesday night. while shooting baskets with a friend. he collapsed once again. He was rushed to the hospital. but this time there would be no tomorrow. Reggie Lewis had died of heart failure. It is a tragic loss that will remain with us for a long time. The world has lost a man of family. a man of faith. a good man. He was a real competitor. a real player. but more importantly a real person.

Now. do you still want the program?\" We have not done that very much. We have not been up front with our taxpayers very much. I know we reregulated the cable industry last year. They said. \"Isnt that wonderful? We are going to get lower cable rates.\" \"We are going to regulate you because we are going to get better service and lower rates.\" and neither one is going to be true. but we appropriated $11 million of taxpayers money to rewrite the rules of regulation and now all the taxpayers of America are going to pay that increased rate in cable rates.",

He was a man who placed principle above party. and service to God. country. and family above all else. Sam will be deeply missed by the community he loved so well and so ably served.

    "speech": "Mr. President. and Members of the Senate. today is the 25th anniversary of Senator DOLES maiden statement on the Senate floor. On April 14. 1969. a young. newly elected BOB DOLE rose to address the Senate for the first time. The subject of his statement then says a lot about BOB DOLE then and now. It was a topic of enduring and personal interest to him. and one to which he has devoted an immense amount of time and energy in his 25 years of Senate service. BOB DOLE spoke. of course. about the abilities of those who were in 1969 generally called handicapped Americans. It was not just Senator DOLES first Senate statement. it was more than that. It was a groundbreaking event in the Senate as well. because for the first time this body was asked to focus its attention in a systematic manner on the broad issue of national policy toward disabled Americans. He addressed the full spectrum of disability issues in that first statement. He spoke of the rights of persons with disabilities to receive a complete education. to hold a job. to get health insurance. to participate in recreational activities. He presented a compelling case for the Federal Governments responsibilities in this area and offered a legislative proposal to that end. He spelled out. in 1969. much of the legislative agenda which he subsequently and successfully pursued with other Senators over many years. Senator DOLE has never made much of the fact that he. himself. has a disability as a result of serious war injuries. Instead. he has used his very formidable abilities to make it possible for all disabled Americans to achieve to the peak of their potential. as every American should have the right to do. His voice remains today uniquely persuasive on the subject. because he has always been able to speak of disabled Americans as \"us.\" not \"them.\" On the anniversary of that statement. I wish to draw the Senates attention to it and to congratulate my colleague and friend. BOB DOLE. for his many successes in working for the rights of disabled Americans and to wish him success in his future endeavors in every area.",

Senator DOLE chose as the subject of his remarks the issue of disabilities. and the problems that people face in this country who were afflicted with various disabilities. I rise this afternoon to join with others to pay tribute to our friend from Kansas. We have our differences from time to time. as we all do in this body on various issues. But it was that speech and his commitment to this issue. bringing a unique perspective. obviously. of someone who could speak about this issue not in the abstract but in very real and personal terms because of his own affliction as a result of a warrelated injury. Twentyfive years ago people who suffered from disabilities faced mountains of obstacles in order to become part of the mainstream in our society. BOB DOLE gave a speech on that April 14. 1969. and raised the awareness of people in this body. As a result of actions taken by Congress during this past quarter of a century. today the plight of our fellow citizens who suffer from disabilities has been significantly improved. A great deal of that effort. a great deal of that progress is due to BOB DOLE. I wanted to join with others today in recognizing that landmark of a quarter of a century ago. to commend him for It and to wish him well. I know he will continue his fight on behalf of people who have suffered from disabilities. be they physical or otherwise. to see to it that every American in this country has an opportunity to make a contribution to the maximum of his or her potential and possibilities.

In the latter 1970s. 1979 to 1981. actually. we saw a surge In oil prices and an unwise foreign lending. which went to Mexico. creating a situation which led wage rates to artificially increase and then during the early part of the 1980s we saw socialist policies which brought about a major collapse.

Liberal idealists reject the idea that private organizations might better serve the needy. I have always believed these conclusions to be false. It is not in spite of. but because of private industrys selfinterest that it is able to operate more efficiently than publicly funded programs. The following article by Sol Stern. published in the September 7. 1993 edition of the Wall Street Journal. chronicles the success enjoyed by one private firm which is serving not only its own needs. but also the needs of the unemployed. This company. called America Works. is turning a profit and serving the public good. training and placing the unemployed in stable jobs. In the process. they build tax rolls. decrease the burden of social services. and even manage to turn a profit. As Congress and the administration debate the reinvention of Government. we might all keep the example of America Works in mind. I believe that Government needs to be redefined. not reinvented. As all those who read this article will quickly see. private industry has a much more compelling desire to see individuals succeed. That desire may not be entirely altruistic. but it is all the more successful because of the selfinterest which motivates it. Too often. Government does not have an interest In the needs of its citizens. Private industry has just such an interest. Too often. Government jobs programs do not lead to more employment. Private industry does. I recpmmend this article to all my colleagues and to all those who wish to reinvent. redefine. or otherwise reform Government. (From the Wall Street Journal. Sept. 7. 1993]",

Included among the Shoreham students winning creations is a smoke detector for the hearing impaired and a wet floor sign with an alarm that is activated when someone walks onto the slippery area. This years competition marks the 100th anniversary of American film. Like many American businesses. the motion picture industry originated with the help of innovative and original thinkers such as Thomas Alva Edison and Mary Pickford. With continued hard work and a little luck. perhaps this years contestants will enjoy similar success with their inventions and creations. Mr. Speaker. it gives me great pleasure to congratulate these four young men and women from Long Island. NY. for their exceptional performances. I would also like to commend their instructors. John Holzapfel. Mary Loesing. Florence Mondry. and Karen Peterson. for their efforts in leading these students to success. The ShorehamWading River community is very proud of their outstanding work.",

I will have the pleasure of attending a celebration honoring the Pride of Baltimore /1. The Pride of Baltimore II. a topsail schooner built along the lines of a 19th century Baltimore clipper. symbolizes the rebirth and the character of the city of Baltimore. Through the able leadership of Captains Jan Miles and Robert C. Glover and the 11 other crewman who maintain the complex rig and abundant brightwork. the Pride II has embarked on voyages to ports in many foreign cities. including Rio de Janeiro. Buenos Aires. La Guaira and Panama. Wherever the Pride II may travel. it carries with her the enterprising spirit of all the citizens of Baltimore and its predecessor. the Pride of Baltimore. which was lost at sea in May. 1986. after sailing more than 150.000 miles in 9 years. For the last 5 years. it has served as a world class ambassador of economic development and goodwill for the State of Maryland and the Port of Baltimore. In the course of its mission. the Pride has promoted stronger commercial and cultural links between Maryland and her international trading partners. With her unlimited international sailing capacity. the Pride has evolved into a valuable educational resource. The Student with Pride program links Maryland students with their counterparts from all over the globe. Together. the students study a curriculum of geography. math. science. and history based on the Prides voyages. The crew stays in touch with the students via the latest in satellite and facsimile technology. Mr. Speaker. it is with great pleasure that I commemorate the 5th anniversary of the commissioning of the Pride of Baltimore II.",

I wish to express my sentiments now. and assure my colleagues that they are just as sincere and heartfelt as those delivered earlier today. Mr. Speaker. the announcement earlier this week stunned and saddened many of us. BOB MICHELS decision not to seek reelection to Congress is not simply the well earned retirement of a hardworking and dedicated colleague. it is the departure of a dear and valued friend. BOB MICHEL was first elected by the people of Illinois to Congress in 1956. today. he is the only Republican Member of this Chamber who remembers service under President Eisenhower. He is one of only three Republican Members who had the experience of service under President Kennedy. Throughout all these years of congressional service. BOB MICHEL deservingly earned a reputation for integrity. for expertise. and for having an open mind as well as a warm heart. The logical choice for Republican leader in 1981. his over one dozen years in that position were golden years for BOB MICHEL and his party. An articulate spokesperson. a skilled leader. a respected adviser. he was extremely effective in advancing the programs of Presidents Reagan and Bush. It is well known that his door has been open for both sides of the aisle at all times. BOB MICHEL will long be remembered as a friend of Congress: as a man who defended this institution at a time when its detractors had the rapt attention of the sensationalist media. BOB never hesitated to point out our achievements. and the fact that for over 200 years we have functioned as the greatest and most effective legislative body the world has ever seen. This Chamberindeed. American politicswill be a sadder place without BOB MICHELS presence. He will be sorely missed by all of us. on both sides of the aisle. and by his constituents from the Peoria area of Illinois who had come to trust in his leadership throughout the past 37 years.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. there is a particular facet of Hugh Scotts life and conduct which is most dear to me as a Virginian representing our Commonwealth in the U.S. Senate. Throughout his political career in Pennsylvania and his private life after leaving the Senate. Hugh Scott was proud of his Virginia heritage. as a graduate of RandolphMacon and of the University of Virginia Law School. Coincidentally. he roomed there 1 year with another distinguished colleague. John Stennis. of Mississippi. In addition to his personal attachment to Virginia and its institutions. Hugh Scott was dedicated to fostering the reality of a viable Republican Party in Virginia. He was a great personal help to our first Republican Governor. Linwood Holton. with whom he always stayed closely allied over the years. Together with Governor Holton. Senator Scott was a key adviser to me as I assumed the positions of Undersecretary and Secretary of the Navy. He always found time to help me as a patient mentor and a trusted resource as I began to explore my own interest in elective office. No one has ever given me better or more thoughtful counsel. And no advice I have taken has ever been more valuable than that he gave me over these many years. Hugh Scott was a gentleman in the best and most classic sense of that word. His personal code of honor was beyond reproach and his partisan advocacy was based on fact and principlenot on conjecture or personality. His firmly grounded civility was matched by ferocity in pursuit of his objective. And the appellation affable tiger was his personal favorite. Hugh Scott possessed tremendous energy from which we. in the Senate. benefited mightily. And that energy characterized his private life as he pursued deep and scholarly interests. particularly in Chinese art. And running as a thread through all these activities. public and private. were his deepseated love of Virginia and his devotion to the enduring themes and values he formed as a young person. During his service as Senator Republican leader. there was on his inner office door a small hand typed \"Prayer of a Breton Fisherman: Oh. God. Thy Sea is so great. and my boat is so small.\" On the inside of that door was a metal plaque showing the University and an excerpt from a farnous poem about the gentlemen who atf ended it:",

I recognize that there are enormous time pressures on the managers of these kinds of measures to expedite consideration of various amendments. but we continue to pass these kinds of amendments for new spending without meaningful scrutiny. This amendment in particular caught my attention because I simply dont believe In this time of enormous fiscal constraints. we should be spending scarce Federal dollars for this purpose. The Simon amendment. which allows the Secretary of the Department of Education to award grants to school districts that want to implement longer school years. is authorized at $100 million. A few hours earlier. I met with educators from my State who expressed their opposition to the Simon amendment. and the concept of a longer school year. This proposal is advanced by those who believe that American schools ought to operate in every facet like schools in Japan and Germany. They are vested in a largely unfounded belief that a longer school year will magically result in higher academic achievement for our students. Standing on its own. a longer school year will not yield better results. without regard for rigorous concentration on core academic subjects. or any consideration for spending more time each day in the classroom. This is. I believe. another \"quick fix.\" a superficial cosmetic concept that will do little to improve classroom instruction and learning. Given scarce resources within the context of a Federal education program that is struggling to define its proper role in State and local education systems. the use of Federal resources for the purpose of lengthening the school year is an inappropriate expenditure. If school districts want to have a longer school year. then let them choose the resourcelocal. State. or Federal. My view is the limited Federal resources ought to be focused on results yielding programs and policiesmany of which are already contained in S. 1513. like professional development for teachers. national education goals for math and science. Head Start. title I for economically and educationally disadvantaged students. educational technology. and womens educational equity programs.",

Congress talks a good game about bringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under control. but there are too many Senators and Members of the House of Representatives who unfailingly find all sorts of excuses for voting to defeat proposals for a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget. As of Thursday. July 28. at the close of business. the Federal debt stooddown to the pennyat exactly $4.638.859.244.759.68. This debt. mind you. was run up by the Congress of the United Statesthe bigspending bureaucrats in the executive branch of the U.S. Government cannot spend a dime that has not first been authorized and appropriated by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Constitution is quite specific about that. as every school boy is supposed to know. And pay no attention to the declarations by politicians that the Federal debt was run up by one President or another. depending on party affiliation. Sometimes they say Ronald Reagan ran it up. sometimes they say George Bush. I even heard that Jimmy Carter helped run it up. All three suggestions are wrong. They are false because the Congress of the United States is the culprit. Most people cannot conceive of a billion of nnything. let alone a trillion. It may pr%.vide a bit of perspective to bear in mind that a billion seconds ago. Mr. President. the Cuban missile crisis was going on. A billion minutes ago. not many years had elapsed since Christ was crucified.

I speak with a little bit of prejudice because I have known Judge Breyer from back in 1973. a year and a half before I came to Congress. I had the chance to get acquainted with Judge Breyer and his family. In terms of fairness. I do not think there is any question he is going to do a good job. In terms of just intrinsic ability. as Senator BIDEN says. those who have worked with him up on Capitol Hill know that he has that ability. In terms of compassion. feeling for people.

Norway announced that it would resume commercial whaling this summer. without regard for any management plan adopted by the IWC. Despite worldwide condemnation and strong pressure by the United States and other countries. Norway remains Intent on following through with its threat to resume the commercial killing of whales. Norways actions clearly undermine the authority of the IWC and even threaten its very existence. Agenda 21. adopted at the U.N. Conference for Environment and Development. recognized the IWC as the sole international organization with authority to manage and protect whales. Norways resumption of whaling Is a flagrant violation of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whalingto which Norway is a party--and could be a fatal blow to the IWC. Like many other international bodies. the IWC has no inherent authority to enforce Its policies. Instead. the IWC depends upon its member countries to participate in the decisionmaking process and then abide by the final decisions. I believe the United States must use sanctions already available in our law to put some weight behind the management plans of the IWC. Today I am introducing the International Whaling Moratorium Enforcement Act of 1993. My bill builds on the Pelly amendment to the Fishermens Protective Act. which allows the President to embargo fisheries products from nations that violate international fisheries agreements. My legislation will require these sanctions for countries that violate IWC management plans. and allow the President to expand these sanctions beyond fisheries products if necessary. My bill will give whaling nations a simple message: If you ignore the IWC. dont plan on dumping your fish on our market. These sanctions are reasonable and workable. but sufficient to get outlaw whaling nations to sit up and take notice. I hope my colleagues in the House will support this timely effort.",

This legislation authorizes a total of 50 tax enterprise zones. 25 to be designated by either the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development In the case of an urban tax enterprise zone. and 25 by the Secretary of Agriculture. in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce. in the case of a rural development investment zone. In addition. this legislation authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designate those areas adversely affected by the closure or realignment of military bases as tax enterprise zones. By utilizing the tax incentives of an enterprise zone. the legislation I am proposing will soften the economic blow to those communities which have relied on the presence of military bases for jobs and economic stability. The designation of areas affected by base closings will attract new industry and spur economic development to replace the loss of revenue and jobs created by a base closing. Many of the tax incentives for enterprise zones in this legislation were Included in H.R. 11. the Revenue Act of 1992. which was vetoed by President Bush last November. The tax incentives in this legislation include: 15 percent employer tax credit for qualified zone wages paid or incurred during such taxable year. deduction for the purchase of enterprise zone stock. and 50 percent exclusion for gain from new zone investments. Mr. Speaker. the passage of this legislation will enable us to make significant progress in attracting businesses to those communities that are most in need of economic development and renewal.",

I rise today to salute the pioneering work of American Women in Radio and Television. a nonprofit organization of professional women and men In the electronic media and allied fields. For more than 40 years. the organization has toiled to improve the quality of the electronic media. especially the image of women. About a year ago. American Women in Radio and Television launched a public service campaign to combat sexual harassment. Although sexual harassment has received substantial publicity recently. victims often are largely unaware of the law and its remedies. as well as of support groups and resources available to help. Studies show that as many as twothirds of working women have experienced sexual harassment. This illegal behavior takes its toll not only In selfesteem. but also in lost productivity in the workplace. With the assistance of a variety of organizations. American Women In Radio and Television has organized a campaign that marries two important societal institutions: the electronic media and our nationwide library system of more than 16.000 libraries. Involved is a \"Stop Sexual Harassment\" resource booklet that is available to all of the libraries. The booklet discusses the issue of sexual harassment and specific ways to deal with harassment. including a suggested list of Government and private resources. Mr. Speaker.

The Commerce Department reported the real gross domestic product rose at a pitifully slow annual rate of 1.8 percent for the first quarter. Real consumer spending has spiraled for the third consecutive month. New orders for durable goods have decreased 3.4 percent since December. But the reason why consumer spendIng is down and the production of goods is light is because people have no confidence in the economy. This economy has not produced new Jobs. At this stage in the last seven recessions. the economy has typically recovered 237 percent of the jobs lost. In the current recovery. we have gained only 29 percent of the Jobs lost. Mr. Speaker. the economy will not cure itself. It will not heal itself as our last President promised it would.

This is a more recent letter that deals precisely with this managers amendment that just went to the desk. I want to read it. It is addressed to me. in my capacity as chairman of the Banking. Housing. and Urban Affairs Committee. The Treasury Secretary writes as follows: I would like to take this opportunity to commend you and Senator DAmato for your hard work and leadership in developing the Thrift Depositor Protection Act of 1993. In April. the Admlnistratioi. anaked the Senate to provide tile Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) with $25 billion and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) with $17 billion to finish the savings and loan cleanup. Although we would prefer that the Congress provide full funding of up to $42 billion so that we could all be reasonably confident that there would be no more costly stop and start funding related to depositor protection. we think the managers amendment takes a responsible approach to funding both the RTC and the SAIF. The managers amendment appropriates $18.3 billion for the RTC and $8.5 billion for SAIF and authorizes an additional $7.5 billion for SAIF. This amount may be enough if regional economic conditions remain at current levels. However. FDIC has estimated that losses. which the SAIF will have to cover. could be as high as $21 billion through 1998. Therefore. it is imperative that neither the amount appropriated nor the amount authorized in the managers amendment be reduced. As I said in my March testimony. Treasury will not release the money unless it is needed. We also support the important management reforms and safeguards in the managers amendment. However. as I said the other day. I believe it is important for S. 714 to remain focused on RTC and SAIF funding issues. This bill is not a proper vehicle for controversial financial institutions and regulatory provisions. Prompt funding will reaffirm the governments commitment to fulfilling its promise to protect depositors. This bill is in the best interest of depositors and taxpayers and does not provide funds for owners and managers of savings and loans. Thanks again for your leadership on this essential issue.

The Convention replaces the existing income tax convention between the United States and the Kingdom of the Netherlands signed at Washington in 1948 and last amended in 1965. It is intended to reduce the distortions (double taxation or excessive taxation) that can arise when two countries tax the same income thereby enabling U.S. firms to compete on a more equitable basis in the Netherlands and further enhancing the attractiveness of the United States to Dutch investors. In general. the Convention follows the pattern of other recent U.S. income tax treaties and is based on the U.S. and OECD Model treaties and recent income tax conventions of both parties. It will serve to modernize tax relations between the two countries. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to Join the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. Senator PACKWOOD. in introducing the Tax Simplification for Families Act of 1993. Senator PACKWOOD has been a longtime supporter of tax simplication. particularly for working families. The legislation we are introducing will greatly simplify tax returns for over 38 million families who claim children as dependents. and for over 10 million individuals who file as head of household. by making several changes to the Tax Code. First. the legislation eliminates the confusing and burdensome support test for claiming a dependent. The support test would be replaced with a simpler residence test used for the earned income tax credit [EITC]. Under the residency test. a taxpayer could claim the exemption for dependents who lived with him or her at least half the year. This change would have two important simplification benefits. First. it would bring current law in line with the common practice of taxpayers since most taxpayers claim a dependent exemption for all individuals living with them regardless of whether they could. in fact. document that they provided more than onehalf of the claimed dependents support. Second. it would make the tests for claiming a dependent substantially identical to those for claiming the EITC. thereby eliminating the need for a separate EITC form. The bill also makes similar changes to the definition of head of household. by eliminating the requirement that the taxpayer provide more than onehalf of the cost of maintaining a household for a dependent. Because the costs of providing a place of residence are generally the largest of all household costs. the maintenance test layered on top of the residency test for dependence status is redundant. The need for simpler laws in this area is apparent from IRS data that show the head of household filing status accounted for an estimated 82 percent of all filing status errors in 1988. The legislation also replaces some 50plus definitions of child in the Tax Code with one uniform definition. and it expands EITC eligibility to military personnel based abroad. Mr. President. I hope that our colleagues will join us and cosponsor this important bill. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill be printed in the RECORD.",

The National Coalition on Television Violence estimates that by the age of 18. the average American young person has witnessed 200.000 acts of violence on television. including 40.000 murders. With American children glued to the television for an average of 27 hours each week. the American Psychological Association now estimates that a typical child will watch 8.000 murders and 100.000 acts of violence before finishing elementary school. Young children often cannot distinguish between violence in televised cartoons and violence in live action programs. A school board in Indiana recently had to issue an advisory to young children warning that there is no such thing as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Children had been crawling down storm drains looking for them. Prof. Brandon Centerwall of the University of Washington. summarizing evidence which he considered conclusive. recently found that. \"if. hypothetically. television technology had never been developed. there would be 10.000 fewer homicides each year in the United States. 70.000 fewer rapes. and 700.000 fewer injurious assaults.

We in Congress are constrained by the first amendment in what restrictions we canor shouldplace on television. In this regard. I applaud the efforts of my colleague from Illinois. Senator SIMON. Senator SIMON was the chief author of the 1990 Television Program Improvement Act which granted broadcast networks. cable television. and programmers an exemption from antitrust law so that they could draft voluntary guidelines. Given first amendment constraints. perhaps the best solution to reducing violence is for the programmers. cable. and networks themselves to exercise selfrestraint. as Senator SIMONs bill seeks to encourage. The bill I am introducing goes handinhand with that effort. I understand that they are beginning to make progress. but they have not gone far enough. This bill provides parents with the information they need to make responsible decisions about what their children are watching. My bill would use another approach. It would provide parents--or others who supervise childrenwith the important information they need in order to make decisions about which shows children can watch. If cable and the networks are not going to take responsibility for reducing the violence they continue to show on television. I think it is only fair that they be required to warn parents and other concerned adults that this violence is coming into their living rooms. It may be harming our children and our society. My bill would require that a video and audio warning label appear before and possibly during certain television showswarning parents and others that the program may contain violence or unsafe gun practices which might adversely affect the mental or physical health of a child.",

You just want to tell us what to say.\" There is a major American Medical Association study reported on by medical doctors who unequivocally find that violence on television is related in an immeasurable way to the violence by teenagers in the United States of America. Frankly. I am not sure we can legislate away that problem. as you have said. But maybe sooner. rather than later. the leadership of Americas television. production companies. movie companies and. yes. the American consumer that pays for- this trash might get the message and somehow we might get less of it. I hope your bill is a start in that direction. and I am very appreciative of the opportunity to speak my piece and to congratulate you.",

It is part of a more fundamental question we are grappling with in our society. My strong belief is that we should not discriminate. but there are others who have equally strong beliefs in the opposite direction. This is not a troubling question only for those of us who create public policy and for our constituents. Recently. I read in America. the fine publication of the Jesuits. an interview by Thomas H. Stahel. S.J.. executive editor of America. with Andrew Sullivan. editor of the New Republic and someone who is openly gay. He is not only openly gay. he is also a practicing and conscientious Roman Catholic. How does he handle this struggle? The article is a good insight into this whole matter. At one point in the interview. Andrew Sullivan says: \"Homosexuality is. so far as one can tell. an involuntary condition.\" The scientific evidence on that is now very strong. I did not take an interest in girls because my father at some point told me. \"Paul. you better take an interest in girls.\" It came very naturally. It was part of my genetic makeup. Others have a different genetic makeup. And the point that President Clinton is trying to make is that people should be judged on their conduct. not by their genes. That does not seem to me to be too radical a step. I ask to insert into the RECORD at this point the interview conducted by Father Thomas Stahel. \"Im Here: An Interview with Andrew Sullivan.\" And I urge my colleagues who are concerned about this question to read this interview.

I rise today to offer an amendment to the National Competitiveness Act of 1993 to require appropriated funding for programs in this bill to be in compliance with the conference report of the concurrent resolution of the budget. as adopted by this Chamber. As a member of both the Budget Committee and the Science. Space and Technology Committee. I find it disturbing that funding levels approved in the budget resolution are not binding throughout the budget process. Simply titled. \"Coordination with Budget Process.\" my amendment would require amounts appropriated for programs under H.R. 820 to be consistent with amounts established under the budget resolution. This amendment does not require reductions to H.R. 820. it requires appropriators to live within the function 370 allocation provided under the budget resolution. H.R. 820 programs are funded under function 370. the Commerce and Housing Credit category. Discretionary budget authority for all commerce and housing credit programs is $3.3 billion under the budget resolution for fiscal year 1994. This is a reduction of $100 million from the fiscal year 1993 discretionary total of $3.4 billion for this function. At the same time function 370 is reduced. H.R. 820 increases spending from $388 million in fiscal year 1993 to $540 million in fiscal year 1994. It also provides for funding of over $1 billion in fiscal year 1995. The percentage of function 370 resources used for H.R. 820 programs would increase from 11 to 30 percent in just 2 years. While the President has requested and the committee has provided increases for programs under H.R. 820. lets agree not to exceed budget resolution funding levels. Mr. Speaker. while I do not agree with the budget resolution. and I believe the amounts authorized under H.R. 820 are in excess of what we can afford. I ask that this Chamber agree to limit appropriations for programs under H.R. 820 to the extent provided for under the budget resolution. Mr. Speaker. when Congress passed the budget resolution. it claimed to be for deficit reduction. This is a vote on whether Congress is willing to live within the budget resolution by making it part of this law.

The purpose of the amendment of the gentleman from Michigan is to require that we do not go over the total amount that has been allocated in function 370. The whole point of this is does the budget resolution have meaning or not? If it has meaning. then we ought to stay within function 370. We ought to stay at the $3.4 billion. We will hassle it out in the Appropriations Committee with respect to whether it goes to the Housing Credit Programs. the Commerce Programs. the Science.

I commend both Senator REID and Senator HATCH for cosponsoring this measure. In the past. children who were victims of abuse were often victimized a second time by our criminal Justice system. The Victims of Child Abuse Act supported programs to reduce the trauma of child victims. Through the CourtAppointed Special Advocate Program. children are assured that their interests will be adequately represented. Advocates provide for the immediate reporting of abuse. facilitate the prompt review of cases. and make recommendations for the childs best interests. Through the Child Abuse Training Program. judicial personnel and practitioners are trained to improve the systems handling of child abuse cases. One of the main objectives is to avoid the unnecessary placement of children in foster care or institutional care. Finally. through televised testimony. children are given a voice. Closed circuit televising and the video taping of testimony alleviate the terror that has. in the past. silenced too many of our children when forced to face their assailants in court.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to speak today about recent events in the Indian State of Kashmir along the IndiaPakistan border. Since 1989. Moslem separatists there have fought a bloody war for independence from the Hindudominated Indian Government. Since the Indian Government first sent troops to the area in an attempt to defeat the rebels and restore order. there have been persistent reports of widespread human rights violations by both sides. In recent weeks. a serious conflict with possible international ramifications has developed in the city of Srinagar in Kashmir. Reports indicate that separatist leaders were demonstrating outside of the Hazratbal Mosque. the holiest mosque in Kashmir. when Government troops fired on them. More than 200 men. women. and children are trapped in the mosque with little food and few medical supplies. The Indian Government says its troops originally surrounded the mosque to capture armed militants who were inside. The Government also says that it is attempting to negotiate a settlement and that the separatists in the mosque have threatened to blow it up if the Government forces do not leave. The Kashmiris say that the mosque is occupied by civilians who sought shelter on the way back from their pilgrimages. Some journalists in the area report that there are few. if any. militants inside. Demonstrations against the Government siege have also turned bloody. When people in the nearby town of Bijbehara organized a march to the mosque to protest the Governments actions. Indian troops reportedly attacked them. firing indiscriminately on the crowd. The massacre left nearly 40 dead and 200 wounded. The events in Kashmir have elevated tensions between India and Pakistan. The Indian Government holds the Pakistani Government accountable for supporting Kashmiri terrorists. while the Pakistanis accuse their neighbors of antiMoslem actions. Mr. President. while neither India nor Pakistan has threatened the other directly. the potential for this recent violence to escalate cannot be ignored. I urge the State Department to do everything possible to help bring about a peaceful end to this latest dispute.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. from time to time I offer for the RECORD a biweekly compilation of the latest outrageous. sometimes humorous. quotes from the liberal media. That description is not original with me. it is how the Media Research Center in Alexander describes its biweekly publication. Notable Quotables. I ask unanimous consent that the November 8. 1993. issue of Notable Quotables (Vol. Six. No. 23) be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. Mr. President. this publication serves the muchneeded and very important purpose of puncturing the twolegged hotair balloons who dominate much of the major media in Washington. These are journalists. broadcasters. and others who quote each others impeccable wisdom. as they see themselves. and all of them busily and viciously attack every public figure with whom they disagree. They falsely blame all of Americas problems on Ronald Reagan and George Bush. they ridicule every conservative in sightand they never worry about falsely accusing any of their philosophical adversaries. A couple of examples: Bryant Gumbel of NBCs \"Today\" show. has a reputation for being unable to keep his roving hands off women with whom he comes in contact. Yet he presents himself as a defender of women and made slurring remarks about Senate votes in the Packwood matter. Then there is a young woman on one of the Saturday night talk shows who has locked Jawsopen. She outshouts anybody else on the shows panelespecially anyone who takes a position contrary to her various leftwing fixations. Anyway. Mr. President. I believe a great many Senators and others may enjoy the November 8 issue of Notable Quotables.",

I have heretofore discussed some of them in terms of their achievements. Today I invite Senators who will take note of a significant address by John G. Medlin. Jr.. at the U.S. Bankers Forum 1993 meeting in Chicago on October 20. John Medlin is chief executive officer of the Wachovia Corp. in WinstonSalem. I have watched his splendid career beginning years ago when he first became an officer of Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. Mr. President. John Medlin has always espoused sound. conservative economic policies. His speech in Chicago was another instance of his preaching the sound economic doctrine. For example. note this comment: The fortunes of banks are determined over time largely by a combination of public policies. economic conditions. and management capabilities. The convergence of shortcomings in all of those areas during the past decade caused extraordinary strains and failures in the financial system of the nation. The genesis of these problems can be found to a great extent in socialized public policies which weakened private enterprise disciplines. Mr. President. John Medlins Chicago speech was filled with sound advice and legitimate warnings. As always. the text of his remarks is well worth reading and I therefore ask unanimous consent that the entire text be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

I worked with Chairman JOHNSTON of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to make sure appropriations legislation expressly includes language ensuring that funds are available to move forward on cleanup efforts in Leadville.

U.S.A.. with an express emphasis on saluting the work of Americas law enforcement personnel. This amendment stands on its inherent merit. However. it is all the more pertinent given the extraordinary reliance the anticrime bill places on the cop on the beat. The bill will contribute to fielding some 100.000 new police officers in communities across this nation. and it will build 10 new regional Federal prisons to keep criminals off the street. It is only appropriate. therefore. that we designate May 1. 1994 as a special day to salute the frontline service of these professionals in Americas war on crime. Heretofore. Mr. President. the purpose of Law Day has been defined somewhat vaguely as a day to celebrate justice under the law. to advance equality. and to encourage respect for law. My amendment preserves this tradition. but seeks to sharpen the focus of Law Day as a day of salute to our Nations law enforcement personnelthe men and women who protect our lives and property. patrol our roadways. and staff our correctional facilities. Bear in mind. Mr. President. the laws presence is perhaps most immediate and profound on the police officers beat and in the jailhouse. This amendment gives special recognition to Americas constables. sheriffs deputies. police officers. detectives. wardens and correctional officers. Truly. these men and women stand as the firstline defense of our laws and of our civil order. They are devoted to their jobs. tireless in their efforts. and often underpaid for their efforts. Moreover. their jobs are inherently dangerous. Even on seemingly routine assignments. these public servants put at risk their own safety in order to guarantee the safety of others. Of course. we all honor those who have fallen in the line of duty as law enforcement officers. But let me be clear: First and foremost. my amendment seeks to salute the living. America owes these men and women an incalculable debta debt not of dollars. but of gratitude and deep respect. It was an honor to sponsor this amendment.

During the 41 years General Engler served his country. he proved to be a valiant and able soldier. He rose to the position of Commanding General of the U.S. Army in Japan and served in that position from 19613. From 196667. he was the Deputy Army Commanding General of Logistics in Vietnam. His decorations included four Distinguished Service Medals. two Legions of Merit. a Bronze Star. and an Air Medal. After retiring from the Army. General Engler continued to serve the military community by becoming involved with several military organizations. He was the executive vice president of the American Ordnance Association and the Defense Preparedness Association. He also was the Chief of Staff of the Military Order of the World Wars. General Engler was a dedicated officer who was committed to the mission of our military. He will be sorely missed by those who were privileged to servo with him.

The act made it unlawful to manufacture or import armorpiercing ammunition. President Reagan signed the bill into law on August 8. 1986. As I said in 1986. copkiller bullets have no place in the arsenal of any sportsman or lawabiding citizen. They have only one purposeto injure or kill police officers.

We did this in 1986. and must do so again now. It has recently come to our attention that a Swedishmade bullet. the M39B. does not fall under the 1986 prohibition because of its composition. The M39B is a 9mm round capable of piercing the soft body armor worn by police because it has a thick steel Jacket surrounding a lead corerather than the hard projectile core in other armorpiercing rounds. The Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco. and Firearms [BATF] supports a ban on the M39B. which would be limited to this kind of ammunition only. The Fraternal Order of Police and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association have also endorsed this legislation. We need this bill to protect our police officers.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Worker Protection Warning Act of 1993. I am proud to join Senator PELL in cosponsoring this important legislation. The Worker Protection Warning Act directs the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] to develop and mandate uniform warnings and instructions for equipment designed to protect workers from workplace hazards. OSHA will develop these warnings in cooperation with workers. employers. human factors experts. manufacturers of safety equipment. and other experts in the field. Companies who manufacture protective equipment. as well as employers and employees who use these products will benefit from this legislation. Current manufacturers warnings and instructions are not uniform. even those on similar personal protective equipment. Consequently. workers have to be retrained every time they use new brands of equipment or when they are hired by new employers. To add to this confusion. warning and instruction methods are determined on a State by State basis. Therefore. the system tends to be inconsistent and confusing to all involvedworkers. employers. safety directors. and equipment manufacturers. Uniform Federal warnings will greatly reduce the difficulty many manufacturers face in attempting to comply with multiple State guidelines. In addition. uniform warnings will simplify instructions. limit training and retraining time. andultimately--help protect workers. More effective warnings will mean fewer accidents caused by protective equipment misuse. The warnings required by this bill must go beyond notifying employers and employees of the risks of bodily injury. In addition. the warnings must also detail a products limitations. its proper uses. and common misuses. OSHA will also define the means by which equipment manufacturers will convey the warnings. and will require employers to communicate the warnings to their workers. train them in the proper use of equipment. and warn them of the safety consequences if they do not follow these instructions. Mr. President. under this legislation. manufacturers of personal protection equipment will remain liable for workers injuries resulting from design and manufacturing defects. and for failing to supply necessary warnings. However. a national standard should result in fewer court proceedings.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to express my wholehearted support for H.R. 20. to allow increased participation by Federal and postal employees in the electoral process. I would hope also that we pass this today with a strong majority approximating that of last session. Particularly. I would strongly advise against any developments down the road that would see the need to exclude employees of the DIA. the IRS. or other Federal agencies from basic political participation and civil rights. I think they can be trusted as much as any other Federal employees. The original Hatch Act was passed over 50 years ago as a remedy to abuses which occurred in the system. Currently. the rules governing Federal and postal employees participation in political campaigns are complicated. restrictive. and inconsistent. The Hatch Act is long overdue for revision because Federal hiring has changed substantially and most Federal employees are brought into the service through the merit system. The Hatch Act has deprived Federal and postal workers of basic democratic rights. H.R. 20 is identical to the bill passed by the House in 1989. It is a reasonable and responsible approach to reinstate the basic rights which have been denied Federal and postal employees. H.R. 20 allows Federal and postal employees to participate in political activities during their own free time. No political activities are allowed while on duty or on the job. This bill also contains mechanisms to guard against political coercion. It strengthens the penalties to protect Government employees from intimidation and coercive behavior. I believe this bill provides a proper balance of restoring basic political rights and ample protection against abuse. I want to commend Chairman CLAY for his leadership and perseverance on behalf of the Federal and postal work force on this important issue. H.R. 20 is vital to Federal and postal employees and I urge my colleagues to support it.",

Imagine having someone appear at your door asking for a political contribution and then finding out shortly thereafter that that person is an IRS official auditing your tax returns. Federal employees in the regulatory and enforcement agencies are able to exert influence over private citizens which other Federal employees simply cannot. I had been a long time opponent of reforming the Hatch Act. I had been concerned that Federal employees could not be adequately protected against coercion by their bosses and I still believe we must be vigilant about such pressures. However. after speaking to a number of constituents who are Federal employees. I believe their right not to participate will be protected. It is imperative and necessary that Federal employees in the regulatory and enforcement agencies be exempted from this reform.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 20. the Federal Employees Political Activities Act. While we will hear many arguments for and against this bill. I believe the issue before us is very straightforward. Will the U.S. Congress today. extend to a small group of American citizens. the same rights and privileges to participate in the political process that it provides to the rest of the country. and that it demands from other nations throughout the world? H.R. 20 finally gives Federal employees their full rights as American citizens. while at the same time protecting them and the American public from political coercion. In 1939. when the Hatch Act was first passed. there may have been very good reasons to deny Federal employees full participation in the political process. However. our country and our Federal work force have changed considerably since that time. and there is now no reason to disenfranchise this group of Americans from engaging fully in their constitutional rights. In fact. this bill is just as notable for the rights it brings to Federal employees. as it is for the prohibitions it places on them. Under H.R. 20. Federal employees may not intimidate. threaten. command. or coerce any other employee in the work force for political purposes. The bill also prohibits the use of official information toward that end. and would impose fines. reductions in grade. suspension. and ultimately removal from the Federal work force for anyone violating this law. H.R. 20 is a tough bill which ensures the impartiality of our Federal work force. On a personal note. let me also add. that during 26 years of public service in the State of Maryland. I have never heard one complaint from any Maryland State employee about the rights they have to participate fully in the political process. So let us take a step today to guarantee Federal employees the same rights we demand for the rest of our country. and the same rights accorded State employees from States like Maryland and Virginia.

This legislation is long overdue. For over 50 years Federal employees have been prohibited from participating in political activities. The 1939 Hatch Act. well intended as it may have been. is outdated and in need of reform. Times have changed dramatically since 1939. Currently. 78.6 percent of all Federal employees are covered under a merit system that protects them from coercion and political solicitation. This act not only infringes on Federal workers first amendment rights of free speech and association. but it also shuts them out of the political process through which decisions affecting their lives are made. Giving Federal workers the right to participate in partisan politics does not mean the Federal work force will become politicized. It simply means that they will have a voice. H.R. 20 would restore Federal employees rights to participate voluntarily. as private citizens. in the political process of this Nation. This legislation would allow Federal workers to run for any elective public office. or work on a campaign. as long as it does not interfere with their job performance and is not on official time.

It contains numerous provisions to ensure that political abuse of public office does not happen. I support these provisions as well. as they are a very important safeguard. We are not considering Hatch Act repeal. we are considering Hatch Act reform. Mr. Speaker. this bill was voted on twice before I got here. I wish it had been enacted then. but I will settle for now. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to give full political rights to Federal employees by voting for H.R. 20.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 20. the Federal Employees Political Activities Act. This issue has been debated repeatedly over the past several years. but the bottom line is simply this: it is time for us to stop treating our Federal employees like secondclass citizens. As everyone in this Chamber knows. Federal employees are currently denied certain rights that every other citizen of the United States enjoysnamely. the right to participate fully in our electoral process. H.R. 20 would lift prohibitions on Federal employees political participation that were imposed over 50 years ago with enactment of the Hatch Act. The bill restores their rights to partake voluntarily. without fear or coercion. as private citizens in the political process of this Nation. However. at the same time. this legislation fully recognizes the need to maintain a professional. nonpartisan Federal work force. H.R. 20 strictly prohibits Federal employees from undertaking political activities while on the job. Moreover. this bill would impose fines and prison sentences on supervisors and coworkers who attempt to coerce an employee into making political contributions or performing political activities. The fines would be up to a maximum of $5.000 and the prison term could be as much as 3 years. Mr. Speaker. we now have the opportunity to right the fundamental wrongs imposed by the Hatch Act. I have been proud to be a longtime supporter of Hatch Act reform legislation and I am proud to cast my vote today to correct this injustice. I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring fullfledged citizenship status to our Nations Federal employees.",

These politicians have join forces to undermine our President. Today I am going to provide the American people with the answers to all of their questions about the Presidents plan. But first let us start with a little history. Question: What did the Republicans do during the Reagan and Bush administrations in the 1980s? Answer: Well. they just quadrupled the national deficit. and gave the rich enough tax breaks so that they could party their way through the 1980s. Question: Does the Presidents plan turn around the trickledown economics of the Reagan and Bush years by putting forth a deficit reduction plan that is as fair as it is real in bringing down the deficit? Answer: Yes. it does. Question: Does the budget plan include tough cuts to support not only the largest deficit reduction in history but new investments as well? Answer: Yes. it does. Question: For every dollar of new investment. is there a dollar of spending cut to pay for it and two more for deficit reduction? Answer: Yes. there is. Question: Will the majority of the taxes fall on the wealthy Americans. those that make over $100.000? Answer: Yes. 75 percent of all taxes we raise will fall on the top 5.5 percent of all Americans. Question: Should the American people get behind our President and support his economic plan? Answer: Yes. they should.",

This study makes for sober reading as the House is soon to begin its debate on the Presidents tax and spend reconciliation package. The Foundations analysis concluded that the United States will lose close to half a million jobs through 1998. In my own district in central Florida almost 700 people could lose their Job through the impact of the energy tax. These job losses would stem from several important factors. including greater expenses for energyintensive businesses and changes in consumer behavior as a result of higher costs to use that energy. Instead of driving people out of work and forcing more burdens on small business. the President should be looking for ways to increase jobs and remove Government interference from small businesses.",

I doubt that those 43 percent of the voters who cast their ballots for Bill Clinton on election day were actually voting for an energy tax which will raise the price on everything from the gas pump to the grocery store. I doubt that they were voting in favor of increased taxes on Social Security recipients. I doubt that they were voting for middleclass tax increases. particularly since candidate Clinton was promising middleclass tax cuts.

Why is that real? Not because the Democrats say so. not because the Republicans say it is not. but because the bond markets in this country and the people who are betting their pension fund money and betting their investment money are betting it is real. That Is why we see the lowest interest rates in 20 years. What does that deficit reduction mean to middle America?

And that is true. Except of course. if you are the seven longtime nonpolitical employees involved who now have been firedrehired maybeand have had their reputations and careers permanently damaged.

We certainly do not need the largest tax increase in history on top of what we already have.

One glaring example is the law which exempts shipping companies incorporated in foreign countries from paying U.S. income taxes. This law has allowed Carnival Cruise Lines to avoid paying any tax at all on hundreds of millions of profits. It has turned Carnivals founder into a billionaire who Forbes magazine listed in 1991 as one of the 15 richest people in the United States. In one recent 4year period. Carnival paid not one penny on over half a billion in profits. Most of its business is with American Citizens conducted out of an office in Miami.

Surely. at the time. there was some disagreement over whether that was the appropriate thing to do. but the fact is that the select committees no longer exist. Of the $3.6 million that the selects were authorized to spend on salaries and expenses this year. approximately $1.5 million was left when the committees expired. However. unless the House takes action to rescind the remaining budget authority. that money is going to be spent. somehow. somewhereit could be reprogrammed. and drawn down for other reasons. Yesterday. I went to the Rules Committee to ask that they make in order an amendment that I was seeking to offer to H.R. 2244. the son of stimulus bill. But I was denied. My amendment was a simple one. It would have rescinded the budget authority that was left after the selects closed their doors. This is a small but necessary step. iesigned to assure that the $1.5 million saved by eliminating the select committees is returned to the taxpayers. and not spent. for some other purpose. by the Congress. This money does not belong to the Congress. it belongs to the American people. Mr. Speaker. it seems to me that the best time for the Congress to consider a measure which would save money belonging to American taxpayers. is while we are considering several other measures to spend money belonging to American taxpayers. And. this week. the Congress is taxing and spending every single taxpayer dollar they can find. The people I represent have made one point crystal clear. Cut spending first is a message that I have received loud and clear since the day I arrived here. and that is what I was hoping to do today. While $1.5 million may seem like pocket change to the Congress. I am sure that the taxpayers. to whom that $1.5 million belong. would love to have it back. Therefore. I ask my colleagues to join me in defeating the previous question. so that I might have a chance to offer my amendment here today.

This is the fourth appropriations bill for fiscal year 1994 to come before the House. I want to commend the gentleman from North Carolina . chairman of the Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee. and the gentlelady from Nevada . the ranking minority member on the subcommittee. This important bill provides support for our active duty forces as well as our National Guard and Reserves. Also. this bill provides funding for base realignment and closure activities. We need to provide for these activities so that the Department of Defense can continue to downsize In an efficient manner. I want to commend all 11 members of the Subcommittee on Military Construction on a good bill. The next 2 weeks will be active ones on the floor of the House because of bills reported by the Committee on Appropriations as we continue to move our bills for consideration prior to our Fourth of July work period. I want to thank all Members for their cooperation. Again. I want to commend subcommittee members for a job well done. I urge adoption of this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank Mr. HEFNER. Mrs. VUCANOVICH. and the military construction staff. I ask the Members to support the bill. Members quote unquote projects are being given a bad name. There is no question that. in the past. there have been abuses. but I remind you. that under the Constitution. it is the duty of the Congress to decide what is to be funded. If we are to act merely as a rubberstamp for the administrations proposals. all of us might as well go home. And If we go home. the executive could save $2 billion for the operation of the legislative branchbut then the Constitution would not be served because there would be no representation of the people. I have a Members initiative in this bill--it is a day care center for the children of the troops serving at Edgewood arsenal. The Army slated this project to be completed with minor construction funds. However. there Is a limit of $1.5 million for those items. The day care centers projected cost is $1.45 million. If the bids come in for over $1.5 millionminor construction funds could not be used. As a result. the day care center could not be builtand one is needed. Currently. the child care center Is housed in a World War II era stable. I would like to quote DODs own description: Buildings \"consist of three separate World War It wood buildings contaminated with friable asbestos and lead paint. The buildings have structural problems. * * * Facilities are presently required to use bottled water for drinking due to the condition of the pipes. The present capacity of 125 does not meet the current need of 363 children.\" This need has existed for years. and the Army did not budget for an adequate child care center. The executive branch cannot know the needs in every congressional district. That is why we are here. We are not rubberstamps. That Is why my constituents have sent me here. It is my duty to raise this and other issues that affect my district. I urge support of the bill.",

They are housed in poorly configured structures in the units overcrowded operational training area. which cannot be expanded. The current facilities present health risks. inefficient training routines. and increased operation and maintenance costs that degrade the mission readiness of the unit.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2446. the fiscal year 1994 military construction appropriation bill. This is an important bill because it is an investment in the protection of our peace and freedom. Even in these days of downsizing the military. what we ultimately spend on our armed forces guarantees that we can live in peace and freedom. American men and women are encouraged to serve in the military when we provide efficient. quality workplaces and modern housing facilities. This is something we must do to continue having an all volunteer force. The $10.3 billion bill is roughly divided into thirds: First. S3.5 billion for military construction. second. $3.6 billion for family housing. and third. $3 billion for base closure. While the bill Is over fiscal year 1993 levels. this is due to base closure expenses and making up for a Department of Defenseinitiated construction pause. H.R. 2446 is $63 million under the military construction 602(b) allocation in budget authority. It is at the 602(b) allocation in outlays. On a parochial bases. let me note about $28 million in construction projects at WrightPatterson Air Force Base which is partially in my district. All of these projects were requested by the administration. Finally. I want to say what a great privilege it is to serve on the military construction subcommittee. Of the choices I looked at when I came to the Appropriations Committee this year. Milcon was my first choice. My thanks and compliments to the distinguished chairman. the gentleman from North Carolina . the distinguished ranking minority member. the gentlewoman from Nevada . and all the subcommittee members for their hard work. H.R. 2446 is an excellent bill and I highly recommend it to you.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2446. In an era of increasingly limited resources. this Member recognizes the enormous difficulties that our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee must face. They are forced to make difficult choices among many worthy programs. knowing full well that there are not sufficient funds to support even a fraction of the competing initiatives. This is particularly true for the military construction subcommittee. which must simultaneously deal with issues such as the base closings. the NATO infrastructure account. consolidation of numerous assets for active duty forces. and the continued modernization of National Guard and Reserve facilities. It is with that in mind that this Member expresses his sincere gratitude to the Chairman of the military construction subcommittee. the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina . and the distinguished ranking m.Member. the gentlewoman from Nevada . for supporting important and much needed modernizations for the Nebraska Air National Guard with the recommended $7.3 million for hanger construction and renovation plus $1.850.000 for a necessary fire station construction project. As the subcommittee recognizes. the Nebraska Air Guard is in the midst of a transition from RF4C reconnaissance aircraft to KC135R tankers. The Nebraska Air Guard has enthusiastically embraced this new mission. and the conversion is well underway. However. a number of infrastructure alterations are necessary to support the conversion. Of particular concern is the old maintenance hanger and repair facility. The hanger in question is almost 40 years old and is showing its age. Moreover. it is filled with old asbestos insulation. which carries with it obvious health risks. While it may have been adequate to maintain small fightertype aircraft such as the RF4C. it is completely unsuitable for the much larger KC135R tankers. Construction of the new maintenance hanger is absolutely essential if the Air Guard is to support its new mission. Mr. Chairman. this Member is particularly appreciative of the fact that the military construction subcommittee was able to find the funds required to support the hanger renovation. In doing so. they have made an important. positive contribution to the readiness of our Air National Guard.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. as we consider the military construction appropriations bill today. I have several observations. I would like to thank Chairman HEFNER and ranking member Mrs. VUCANOVICH for their help and consideration in addressing the genuine needs of the Marine Corps base. Camp Pendleton. in this bill. H.R. 2446 contains funds to repair extensive flood damage at Camp Pendleton. which is in my district. I visited Camp Pendleton earlier this year to see flood damage at the base. We saw helicopters buried in mud up the cockpit. A portion of the airstrip was washed away and tons of mud accumulated on the airfield. Bridges and major portions of roadways literally disappeared. Wells were washed away and a sewage treatment plant was severely damaged. Funding in this bill will cover a small portion of flood repairs that need to be made to the base. We have an obligation to provide funding to repair damage at the base. When cities and counties in southern California needed help from flooding this year. they were able to turn to FEMA for help. Obviously. the marines cant do that. We cannot ask the Marine Corps to absorb these costly repairs from a budget that is already stretched to its limits. The defense budget is being hit from all sides. The armed services are being asked to downsize at an historic rate. Military personnel. are being asked to accept a pay freeze. weapons programs are being canceled or drastically scaled back. In short. the defense budget is being cut too deep. too fast. It simply is not fair to turn around and ask them to absorb the costs from this flood damage and any other emergencies that. by definition. come along unexpectedly.",

I urge my colleagues--do not lose sight of the fundamental difference between my substitute and the Hamilton resolution. It is not so much a matter of 6 versus 12 months as it is a question of sorting out our national interests from our international obligations. As articulated by President Bush. we signed on to a mission to save lives and restore hope to a shattered nation. Our American Armed Forces accomplished this humanitarian mission in Somalia. We take pride in a mission well done. No one is suggesting that the United States should walk away from the problems in Somalia or from our obligation to support the U.N. operation in that country. but in this effort. no vital American interests are at stake that require any longterm American troop peacekeeping presence. There are practical limits to what the humanitarian intervention can accomplish in Somalia and most agree that the United States has done more than its fair share in providing food and humanitarian relief to this country. Now is the time for other nations to provide their troops in support of this operation. I ask my colleagues to support removing our troops from Somalia within 6 months.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. Irise in favor of the substitute offered by the ranking minority member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. GILMAN of New York. I believe his approach is more in keeping with the original Intentions of our military mission in Somalia. In my view. this is not a case where selfevident truth is on one side and total error is on the other. Foreign policy is not a science. We should not expect to find certitude where reasonable doubt is about as much as you can hope for. Having said that. I believe the substitute offered by Mr. GILMAN fits the facts of this particular case more closely than the approach of the majority. Above all. the Gilman substitute has one virtue that is lacking in Senate Joint Resolution 45: I refer to the virtue of decisiveness. The Gilman substitute states that: The Congress declares that all United States Armed Forces should be withdrawn from Somalia not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Joint resolution * * * This direct. unambiguous language stands in stark contrast to that of Senate Joint Resolution 45. which commits the Congress to give strong consideration to extending the authorization beyond the initial 12month period. The Gilman substitute has firmness. specificity. and directness. The committee approach is openended. vague. and lacks clarity. In theory there might be some justification for giving the administration what amounts to a blank check. But in this particular case. prudence dictates that the sooner we get American troops out of Somalia. the better. President Bush sent them to do a job. The job Is done. President Clinton should bring them home. The time has come to gather up the loose ends of this successful humanitarian mission. and send our men and women home in 6 months or less. This is what the Gilman substitute will do. with the kind of firmness and directness that marked the operation itself. That is why I am in favor of it and why I urge our colleagues to vote for it.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Roth amendment. When President Bush first sent over troops to Somalia. we were supposed to be out by Inauguration Day. Our mission was to stabilize the situation until a U.N. force took over. American forces held the fort. waiting for the U.N. cavalry to arrive. That took 5 months. We paid the bill. Our magnificent Armed forces did the job well. Food is getting to the people in Somalia. The situation is much more stabilized than was reported on our TV screens last December. Weve already spent nearly $1 billion on this operation with more expenditures on the way. Weve done our fair share. In the name of fiscal sanity. its time to bring our troops home. The resolution before us contains at least a 1year carte blanche for the President to do whatever with the remaining 3.600 American service personnel in Somalia. Plus. they are under United Nations command. They now take their orders from a Turkish general. If we do not bring our troops home and cancel our openended commitment to the Somalia operations. we will spend another $450 millionon top of the $1 billion we have already spent. And that will go on year after year after year. We will spend billions. That is another reason to vote for the Roth amendment. Mr. Chairman. to respect our sovereignty. it is time to bring our troops home and bring them home now. We cannot let them hang out there with the uncertainty that they may not come home for another year. or even by the end of the decade. That would be a prescription for disaster. Thats why I encourage my colleagues to vote for the Roth amendment. It would bring all our troops home from Somalia by June 30 and end the hemorrhaging of hardearned tax dollars to a mission that has been accomplished.

We also have a responsibility to the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States. With respect to this responsibility. make no mistake about it. American military people under all analyses with respect to the law that we are operating under and the United Nations. our American military people are cooperating under the tactical command and will operate in certain combat situations under the tactical command of foreign commanders. I quote very quickly the statement by the chairman of the committee: The U.S. Quick Reaction Force. that is. the 1.300 troops I referred to a moment ago. will remain under U.S. operational control. although they may receive tactical orders in the field from the United Nations sectional commander. That is a euphemism for ordering people into battle. and that is exactly the right that the U.N. commander has. We have a duty to see to it that our men and women who wear the uniform operate under American military commanders. because that allows us. the American people. to have accountability for the actions and the determinations that our military leaders make. General Schwarzkopf is accountable for his actions. or was accountable for his actions. as a U.S. military commander. to the American political establishment. A general from Turkey or Egypt or some other place is not accountable to the American people. and we should see to it that we end this situation as quickly as possible. Second. we have to teach our allies to share these burdens. They also have a responsibility to the starving people of the world. Let me just tell the Members. the account stands as such right now: $1 billion spent by the United States. and $100 million spent by the rest of the world.

The notion of stopping the world because we want to get off is not a very productive notion in 1993. I would like to see every single American soldier back from Somalia tomorrow. not in 30 days or 45 days. but as the worlds one remaining superpower. unless we organize and provide structure to assist them with international security. our costs in blood and treasure will be mindboggling. The notion of pretending that complex issues can be solved with a pushbutton solution is simply absurd. There is no way that this Somalia venture can continue if the United States continues its participation in it. Everything that we have invested in blood and treasure will go down the drain. A superpower of our complexity and sophistication needs some staying power. it needs some longrange perspective. It must recognize that this is a complex world. What my friend. the gentleman from Wisconsin. is complaining about is the complexity of the world we live in. not the specifics of how many days our troops will be there. There will be crises beyond Somalia and Bosnia and Cambodia. and the United States will have a responsibility for participating and anticipating these crises and solving them. To set these ludicrous and arbitrary deadlines. as if that would be a solution. is -just a new guise of isolationism. Had we stopped Hitler early on. the Second World War would not have occurred.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. let us be clear about this. The Roth amendment does three things: It withdraws our troops by June 30. it cancels further United States funds for Somalia. and it mirrors American public opinion today. It does not affect humanitarian aid. We have done our share in Somalia. and we have done it well. On December 9. we went in to stabilize things for humanitarian reasons. We spent nearly $1 billion. No other nation has done that much. Now other nations are being asked to do their share. and the more we do. the less others will do. They will hold back. Unless we withdraw. we will likely be stuck there for quite a while. The question is how long. The State Department says maybe 17 months. The United Nations says maybe 18 months to 2 years. The intelligence community says maybe up to 7 or 8 years to take care of the problems over there. I suggest that there is a cost involved as well. We have put in $1 billion. Estimates are if we go the length that we have been talking about. we are looking at $450 million. Those are big dollars today. We avoid the U.N. command issue if we support the Roth amendment. which is divisive and troublesome. especially to people like myself who have proudly worn our Nations uniform in one of our armed services.

Number one. it brings all of our troops out in 5 weeks time. Number two. it cuts any United States funding from the United Nations operation in Somalia. We just voted a few minutes ago in this Chamber against a Gilman substitute that provided 6 months time before we had to get out. Now they come in with an amendment for only 5 weeks time. That obviously is much too short. If we voted against the 6 month period. we are going to have to vote. it seems to me. against an even shorter period of time. which is 5 weeks. It is important to understand here that the United States is a key actor in Somalia. If we simply pull out the rug from the Somalia operation. then there will not be a Somalia operation. and all of the investment and all of the effort that we have made in Operation Restore Hope. in which most of us in this Chamber have a great deal of pride. justifiably. would be lost. We want to try to complete the task. We want a smooth transition from the U.S. effort to the U.N. effort. and that is what this resolution is all about. The Roth amendment would totally undercut that transition. Second. the Roth amendment cuts our funding for the United Nations. We went to the United Nations a few weeks ago and we voted for this resolution. We said to the world and the United Nations that we are going to support this effort. If we come along now and cut our financial support. we are reneging on a commitment that we made to support the Somalian effort. But beyond that. we are also reneging on support of peacekeeping assessments in general. My friends. I strongly urge Members not to support the Roth amendment. It would pull the rug out from UNOSOM II. It would provide no money for the United Nations and renege on the commitments that the United States Government has solemnly made in the Security Council.

The Constitution. according to my reading. actually does protect free speech even in the public school systems where children voluntarily decide if they need the right to pray. The House bill gives that right. and simply says that if a school voluntarily decides that it is acceptable to allow voluntary prayer. they should not be denied funding of Federal funds for that.

    "speech": "motion and the House language make sense. The House bill would deny funds to any State or school district which has a policy of denying or preventing participation in constitutionally protected prayer in public schools by individuals on a voluntary basis. Mr. JOHNSONs motion would retain that language. I agree that officials at our public schools should obey the law and allow constitutionally protected prayer in public schools. And. I agree that there should be legal recourse for parents in the cases where a students right to pray has been abrogated. The problem. Mr. Speaker. lies in determining what kinds of prayer are. in fact. constitutionally protected. Frankly. the Supreme Court has Issued decisions on this important issue that even Constitutional scholars find difficult to Interpret. I do not think that we should require our public school superintendents to turn themselves into constitutional scholars so as not to jeopardize their funding under this bill. I also do not think we should allow lunding for all disabled and disadvantaged students to be held hostage to any single individual who may believe that their rights have been violated. Such an Individual has an absolute right to seek recourse In court. Enhancing this right by allowing an individual to seek a cutoff of all Federal funds Is unnecessary and an unreasonable intrusion Into the affairs of a local school district. At the present time. most public school officials err on the side of being overly cautious in allowing prayers by Individual students at H It school. Without clarification from the Supreme 11 Court. I believe that school superintendents I who are cautious and careful should not be I penalized or threatened In any way. Their H funds should not be jeopardized. and to do so would be absurd. H I will vote against Mr. JOHNSONS motion to H instruct conferees in continued support for H local control of public schools.",

I am pleased to rise in support of S. 2406. which incorporatesin a slightly revised formthe language of H.R. 1103. the Satellite Home Vic .-ing Act which originally passed the House on August 16. The important legislation before us extends until December 31. 1999. the satellite carriers copyright compulsory license in section 119. title 17. United States Code. The compulsory license granted to satellite carriers is presently scheduled to expire at the end of this year. The bill also clarifies that wireless cable television systems are entitled to avail themselves of the section 111 cable copyright compulsory license. Finally. the bill amends the definition of \"local service area of a primary transmitter\" in section 111(f to correct an anomaly in the Copyright Act that has resulted in newer television stations being treated as distant signals while older stations in the same geographic area are treated as local signals. This disparity in treatment is unjustified and needs to be corrected immediately. In the hardfought compromise reached on this bill. the factors to be considered under the bills \"fair market value\" determination have been made more specific. I would note that. in determining fair market value. we intend that the copyright arbitration panel consider all factors raised by the parties. including cable rates. I should also add that the intent here is to neither require nor preclude the arbitration panel from establishing network rates that are different from the rates established for superstations. I want to commend several distinguished Members for their commitment to bringing this compromise bill to the floor. They are Mr. HUGHES. who chairs the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration. Mr. MOORHEAD. the subcommittees ranking minority member. and subcommittee members Mr. SYNAR and Mr. BouCHER. They all labored long and hard to bridge difficult issues. and this compromise reflects their fine work together. I urge all Members to support passage of S. 2406. Mr. Speaker.

I would like to commend our subcommittee chairman the gentleman from New Jersey . for his hard work and leadership in this area. Also the gentleman from New York has been instrumental in drafting this legislation. Also. the chairman. the gentleman from Texas . has been helpful and we appreciate his leadership as well. Although the main purpose of this legislation is a 50year extension of the Satellite Home Viewer Act which this subcommittee processed in 1988. this bill also contains a provision dealing with the definition of wireless cable which is very similar to a bill. H.R. 759. that RICK BOUCHER and I introduced and which was part of the overall hearings on H.R. 1103. That bill was prompted by a 1992 ruling by the Register of Copyrights that would strip the industry of its compulsory license which it has enjoyed for a number of years under section 111 of the Copyright Act. The compromise before us today. provides that wireless and other cablelike Systems will be made part of the compulsory license. I believe Its important to encourage these new technologies because they will become real competitors of cable TV in the marketplace. Competition is an important factor in keeping cable TV rates at a reasonable price. The consumer will be the ultimate benefactor of this increase in competition. In 1988 when we drafted the original Satellite Home Viewer Act we intended that after 6 years the industry involved would be able to move into voluntary private contracts for the licensing of copyrighted programming. Although the act has worked very well we are not yet to that point where the marketplace can take over. so we still need the regulation provided by this legislation. However. I am pleased to see that during the next negotiations that the arbitrators will at least be able to consider the fair market value of this copyrighted programming. Even under the compromise language. \"fair market value\" is still an important factor to considered when the copyright arbitration panel determines new rates in 1997. We have come a long wayits important legislation and I urge a favorable vote on S. 2406. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "for their leadership and hard work on this important legislation. I also would like to commend our chairman. the gentleman from Texas. for his assistance in bringing this bill to the floor. The original bill which we enacted in 1988 solved a serious problem for satellite carriers and dish owners. Both strongly supported its enactment. Both strongly support the compromise contained in S. 2406. In 1988 we thought that 6 years was enough time for the parties to work out private licensing agreements. However. it is clear to me that more time is needed to sort out private licensing procedures and rights. The original bill provided for an extension of only 4 years which I believed was not enough time. for the consumers who want subscriptions to programming for periods of 1 year or longer or for businesses that need to effectively plan in 4- or 5year cycles. I offered an amendment accepted by the subcommittee that would extend by 1 year the next satellite carrier rate adjustment proceeding and also extend the sunset by 1 year from 1998 to 1999. The compromise that we are presenting today would modify the \"Fair Market Value\" language. contained in the House passed bill. H.R. 1103. and add an additional 6 months. to January 1997 before the \"Fair Market Value\" standard can be considered by the Copyright Arbitration Panel in any rate adjustment proceeding.

Their work is constructive and it is reflected in a measure which will assure that satellite dish owners who cannot receive network signals from a local station may receive them by means of satellite delivery.

This bill will reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act. The Foundation is a federally chartered. charitable nonprofit corporation. Formed in 1984. the Foundation administers donations from the private sector to enhance the conservation work of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Foundation matches these private donationswith Federal appropriations. multiplying their effectiveness. Since its founding. the Foundation has funded over $108 million worth of fish and wildlife conservation projects. while using only $32 million in Federal appropriations. The Foundation has funded over 870 conservation projects across the Nation and around the world. In my own State of Montana. the Foundation is providing a $12.000 grant for an 8week environmental field study program for native American youth in Fort Belknap. It has awarded $25.000 to the Rock Creek Advlsory Council. a Missoula group. to assist in the purchase of conservation easements which will benefit a blue ribbon trout stream and important bighorn sheep winter habitat. The Foundation is also making a $10.000 grant to the Montana Fish. Wildlife and Parks Department to help acquire 24acre Eagle Island. located on the Missouri River. valued for its fisheries and wetlands resources. Projects like these. in Montana and in every other State. are helping improve fish and wildlife conservation in the most costeffective way possible.

With direct input from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and local universities. the Wetlands Policy Center could soon evolve into a true center of excellence in this important area of wetlands policy research. I am particularly enthusiastic about the prospects for the center to become a prototype for the development of graduate degree and career opportunities for minorities and women in the area of environmental sciences.

To date one of the worlds most holy places of worship with such a heinous act Is beyond comprehension. beyond rationality and simply inhuman. Such acts must be denounced by all decentminded people. For it Is decency itself that Is also the victim of this horrible attack. This despicable act Is a setback to peace efforts. and has resulted In continued bloodshed. We cannot allow this tragic event to succeed in stopping the drive to peace. We must redouble our efforts at peacemaking. It Is time to transcend recriminations. finger pointing and the bloodsoaked history that has divided Jews and Arabs. I am heartened that leaders of the major communities in the Middle East have condemned the Hebron massacre.

Officer Kazupskl helped rescue 19 neglected children from a Chicago housing project and deserves recognition for his humanitarian efforts. During a routine narcotic investigation. Police Officer Kazupski and his fellow officers of the Special Operations Unit 153 found 19 children living in subhuman conditions. The children were sleeping In soiled clothes on the filthy bare floor which was littered with trash and rotted food. The officer also noticed bruises and other physical signs of abuse on the childrens bodies. Officer Kazupski then arrested the six adults on the scene and charged them with endangering the life and health of a child. Officer Kazupski was also responsible for the expedient removal of these children from abominable conditions and their safe relocation to the Chicago Department of Children and Family Services. Officer Kazupski has dutifully served 7 years with the special operations unit of the Chicago Police Department. Officer Kazupski Is the loving husband of Jodine and the proud father of his daughter. Katielyn. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to salute Police Officer William F. Kazupski for his extraordinary efforts in the rescue of these 19 children.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I hope that all of my colleagues will take a moment and read the following editorial by David Beckwith entitled \"Somalias Needless Deaths\" which appeared in the November 1. 1993. Issue of the Wall Street Journal. I join Colonel Beckwith in saluting the Ranger/Delta unit which valiantly served in Somalia. They were put into a terrible situation and paid a heavy price for trying to help the Clinton administration in struggling to define the use of force and practice peacekeeping in the postcold war world. Colonel Beckwith describes some very valid and thoughtprovoking lessons from the tragedy in Somalia. and I believe that the military as well as the White House and Members of Congress must begin to wrestle with these very difficult issues before we again put American soldiers into an extremely tough predicament without the supoort or military leadership which is required for us to be militarily successful in peacekeeping missions In the future. It makes my blood boil and brings tears to my eyes when I view the television news and read in the media all the criticism focused on the performance of the U.S. Rangers and Delta Force in Somalia. Despite Maj. Gen. William Garrisons recent letter to President Clinton accepting full responsibility for the now infamous Ranger/Delta operation of Oct. 3. this was indeed nothing more than another case of U.S. forces being placed under United Nations command and suffering for it. Newspaper accounts have painted the operation as a lone U.S. endeavor. But the facts show that. although there was a separate U.S. command. the RangeriDelta operations were ultimately subject to the approval of a U.N. authority. The result: U.S. forces were put into a situation where they were not allowed to prosecute the mission to the full extent of their abilities. They were dropped into a hostile territory with limited rules of engagement. forced to operate outside their normal chain of command and denied the necessary equipment that is part of their standard operating procedure. And if thats not enough. this was all inflicted on them by the civilian military leadership of this country.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we prepare to begin the debate on health care. I would like to call your attention to an article on health care reform written by Merrill Matthews. Jr. Mr. Matthews is the health policy director of the National Center for Policy Analysis and the ethlcist for Richardson Medical Center in Dallas. TX. Mr. Matthews analysis addresses the growing concern about patient autonomy under the health care plan proposed by the Clinton administration. Mr. Matthews argues that the plan proposed by the administration. which will force Americans into a system based strictly on Governmentrun managed competition. further removes the patient from the decisionmaking process because the majority of health care decisions will be based on the cost of the procedure. rather than patient Input. Presently. Canadians are experiencing the effects of a costbased system in which patients can expect to wait months for procedures ranging from CAT scans to heart bypass surgery. In the Canadian system. patient choice is restricted because the Government. rather than the people. controls the costs. In contract. Mr. Matthews goes on to assert that a plan Including medical savings accounts. often referred to as Medisave. is the only health care proposal that respects Individual choice and places control in the hands of the consumers. He contends that Medisave accounts allow for patient automony. while at the same time. advocating savings and prudent health care decisionmaking. Moreover. Mr. Matthews argues that Medisave accounts encourage people to make more responsible health care decisions because it Is their money that Is being spent. This is a sharp contrast to the current system in which the money of a third party is being used to pay for health care needs. In the coming months. the health care debate will be the focus of attention for all Americans. It is my hope and desire that. above all. we remember that this is America. We are not Canada. we are not Germany. our society is unique and is founded upon the principles of individual liberty for all of its citizens. As we determine the health care plan that is best for this country. let us focus not on curing what is wrong with America. but rather resolving this dilemma with what Is right with Americaindividual liberty and choice.",

As national health care expenditures continue to escalate. health care costs at Dominion Resources have risen less than 1 percent. Furthermore. in 1992 Dominion Resources underran their health care budget by 31 percent resulting in a savings of $67.000. These savings were then passed on to employees who conformed to healthy lifestyles. As a health care Innovator Dominion Resources has identified health risk factors and offered employees cash as an incentive to achieve a low risk rating as defined by Insurance industry standards. Additionally. Dominion Resources has created an Interest bearing savings program to provide employees with a mechanism to pay for routine medical expenses. The philosophy guiding the Innovations at Dominion Resources Is that medical benefits should be treated as a form of compensation. and employees who contribute to cutting the medical costs of the company are rewarded. As we prepare to begin the debate to determine the best course of action for health care reform in our country. we should recognize that the Innovative and creative energy of companies such as Dominion Resources are the trademarks of American civilization. Furthermore. we as Americans should carefully consider any health care reform legislation that might stifle these principles. [From the Managers Journal.

It will be a very sad day. it is a very sad day. and I predict a very expensive vote which we took yesterday.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Justice Department cannot be serious about pursuing criminal charges against the Cuban pilot of the Acre Caribbean plane that landed in Miami last week. The pilot. Carlos Cancio. risked his own personal welfare. and that of his family. all in the name of freedom. The 48 defectors on board were not on a joy ride. They took off from Cuba knowing that Cuban fighters or antiaircraft guns could shoot them out of the sky at any moment. The very idea that the U.S. Government Is contemplating legal action against Mr. Cancio is ridiculous. Mr. Cancio piloted an aircraft that launched from oppression and landed in freedom. He liberated 47 other Cubans who similarly yearned for a new. free life in the United States. But Mr. Cancio was also careful to treat humanely those on board who wished to return to Cuba. Those five Individuals have returned safely to Cuba. no worse for the experience. It is inconceivable to me that the Attorney General will attempt to arrest Mr. Cancio. If anything. the Justice Department should announce that Mr. Canclo and his passengers will soon be sworn in as American citizens. Mr. Speaker. Carlos Cancio is not a criminal. He is a hero.",

He advocates that Bill and Hillary Clinton should have every right to send their daughter to a private school. While I think you can make an argument for that. I would say the President and the Vice President are communicating something by sending their youngsters to private schools. The only type of leadership that is worth a darn is leadership by example. and here we have a man who ran for President of the United States. and who was endorsed by the teachers union. and sought their votes. Now he sends his youngster to a private school. What kind of a message does that send? I do not have all of the resources that the gentleman in the well has. and I compliment him for all of the work he has done in education. I do a lot of work in economic competitiveness. If we are going to keep America competitive in the 21st century. we have to have an educational system that is going to allow us to compete. So the question for the gentleman in the well is: What kind of public policy should Bill Clinton be advocating. taking into consideration the decisions he has made as far as education is concerned?",

So what harms the schools. whether it is in the District of Columbia. or Philadelphia. or Chicago. or Milwaukee. harms our entire country. We have to bring all our schools along. The only way you can do that is to bring the entire country along through education. That is why a greater attention to it is so important for us not to write off public education. We must all be involved In this. One way we can do that is by sending a strong signal. Simply saying. \"Hey. I am going to send my kids to the best schools.\" is not the answer.

AfricanAmerican artist Dizzy Gillespie. who was very close to me and did so much to advance Americas foremost music. jazz. Dizzy Gillespie passed away just very recently. We will remember him as a person who celebrated his music as he lived his life. it was one of great joy. He was a very outstanding. outgoing. charismatic performer and entertainer. But of course he was the revolutionary musical artist who joined with Charlie Parker and Max Roach. Buddy Powell. to create this new form of Jazz music. Mr. Speaker. we have introduced legislation for a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor. which we will continue to ask our Members to celebrate Dizzy Gillespie and remember him and his dear wife. May. and the Gillespie family. in terms of their great. permanent contribution to our culture. Dizzy Gillespie was remembered most for the way his cheeks enlarged when he was playing his instrument. He went to Bethesda Hospital to have his cheeks examined. The doctors examining him thereby named this condition \"Gillespie pouches.\" and they were amazed at the fact that they did not interfere with his musicianship. Dizzy played up until very. very recently when he entered the hospital. He led a very full life. a complete life. At one time he was remembered very much as Americas musical diplomat. He was recognized throughout the world by presidents. kings. emperors. monarchies. They knew him well. He was very proud to carry the American flag and our music and to see how jazz was picked up. promoted. played. reinterpreted throughout the countries of the world. I was very honored 2 years ago to accompany him and James Moody on a U.S. Information Agency tour throughout Africa. I was able to be with him and see how people genuinely loved him as an artist and as a human being throughout the world. He will be long remembered. His music is already permanont in our archives. His horn. one of his first horns is already in the Smithsonian Museum. and we are very happy for the full life. the great contributions. the wonderful memories that he leaves behind for music aficionados of every color. creed. race. and nationality throughout the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 10 years ago the Congress enacted my legislation creating a new mandate for the Agency for International Development. to conserve biological diversity. The initiative grew out of a controversy during the previous year within the U.S. delegation attending the World Environmental Conference marking the 10th anniversary of the United Nations Environment Program. Under Secretary of State James Buckley. one leader of the delegation. sought to commit the United States to the principle that biological diversity was worth conserving. He was ultimately thwarted by the then EPA Administrator Ann Gorsuch who doubted the value of biological diversity. By my legislation. I resolved to settle a policy debate that was proving embarrassing to the United States and simply mandate the protection of biological diversity. My bill created a new provision. section 119 of the Foreign Assistance Act. making the conservation of biological diversity an important objective for U.S. foreign assistance. At that time so little was known of the issues related to biological diversity that one of my colleagues. upon encountering the term. asked in jest whether the bill had been cleared with the moral majority. AID. however. embraced section 119 and from its very modest beginnings it has now become a $10 million a year program. It operates in countries ranging from Thailand and Nepal to Kenya and Costa Rica. Because of this legislation there are species still around that might otherwise have been exterminated. many without ever being identified. On this occasion. the 10th anniversary of section 119. the endangered specles provision of the Foreign Assistance Act. I ask unanimous consent that my original proposal be reprinted in the RECORD.

Commander Kings unselfish devotion to duty and to her country has not .only maintained. but helped raise our Armed Forces commitment to excellence.

I am unable to attend todays conference In Taiwan but I wish to thank my Taiwanese friends for inviting me to the very timely conference occurring today on recent developments in Taiwan. I apologize for not being able to make this speech in person. but as a long time student of Taiwan political affairs. I am pleased to note dramatic changes occurring there. On December 19. Taiwan held the first full legislative elections in its 40 year history. All lifelong members who were originally from mainland China retired and their seats were open for election. As a result of these dramatic steps forward. a significant minority of the legislature Is now composed of members of the opposition. the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP]. The legislature has become more accountable to the people. acting as a greater check on other branches of the government. Another encouraging development is that. among native Taiwanese as well as among those of Chinese descent. there Is a growing sense of Taiwanese identity. separate from that of China. Native Taiwanese are being appointed and elected to senior political positions. The first Taiwanese Premier in Taiwans history. Lien. was elected following the resignation of Premier Hau Peitsun. a mainlander. These developments give me a new sense of optimism about the opportunities for peaceful political evolution elsewhere in the world. The rapid political developments in Taiwan have been accompanied by great economic change. as economic policies must increasingly be accountable to the people of Taiwan. There are many positive developments such as President Lee Tenghuls Initiation of a $50 billion development plan. Other economic problems such as the need for greater social welfare. the growing deficit. and the deteriorating trade relations with other countries. will have to be addressed by the new legislature and the President. I applaud Taiwans democratization and encourage its further development. The peaceful evolution of this island nation toward democracy is a model to which other countries. struggling to improve their systems of government. should look.",

I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the committees letter be placed in the RECORD. Mr. President. it was the consensus of the committee that the President should bn granted his request for fasttrack authority in order to make one final attempt to conclude the Uruguay round negotiations. The Presidents goal. endorsed by the committee. is to conclude the round by midDecember. The committees bill would. indeed. require that the President do so if he wants the Implementing bill for the round to benefit from our fasttrack legislative procedures. Under the bill. the President must notify the Congress by December 15. 1993. of his intention to enter into the agreement. and actually sign it before April 16. 1994. United States Trade Representative Kantor has reported to the committee that there is a ray of hope in the Uruguay round.

But wait. according to USDA after figuring in the cost to the Export Enhancement Program by taking this action and after figuring in producers who shift to other program crops because they lose overseas markets you find that. at best. no money is saved through elimination of this program. As Charles Osgood recently said on the \"Osgood Files.\" \"the Sunflower Assistance Program is 1 of 115 Federal programs that Mr. Clinton wants to cut from the 1995 budget. It is the biggest one on the Agriculture hit list. All you need is 114 more like that and. bingo. you havent saved a dime.\" This is not the kind of budget cutting that is going to result in a balanced budget. we need to thoroughly review where we are going with President Clintons Agricultural program cuts.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of this legislation. and I would like to emphasize particularly to my fiscally conservative brothers and sisters that when this legislation first came before the committee. it called for over $400 million a year in spending for EDA and about $250 million a year for ARC. Through negotiation and through compromise. we have been able to take $100 million a year out of the EDA spending and reduce the ARC funding from $249 million to $215 million. or about a 15percent cut. So we have been able to negotiate a compromise here which very significantly reduces these expenditures. Beyond that. I would particularly like to focus on the Appalachian Regional Commission and some independent studies relating to the effectiveness of ARC. First of all. ARC is the kind of a program that is effective because it is not a Washingtondriven program but. rather. a program which has the decisionmaking power in the hands of local people. so the decisions as to how to spend the money in localities is made by local groups rather than by Washington dictating expenditures. That is a very significant point. it seems to me. Beyond that. studies conducted by the Regional Research Institute found that ARC programs have made a significant impact on the difference we see in Appalachia. Many of us know that in Appalachia we have suffered chronic high unemployment. In fact. 15 or so years ago. we were always in double digit unemployment in the Appalachian part of Pennsylvania. and today that average figure is down by anywhere from 5 to 8 percentage points. in part because of the ARC program. Let me be more specific. The Independent Regional Research Institute has reported that ARC programs in 1991 alone generated $8.4 million more income for Appalachia. That certainly is a tremendous return on the investment. when you consider the whole program is only about $200 million a year. Further. that same independent research group reported that counties in Appalachia averaged 48 percent more income growth than similar counties not benefiting from the ARC program. So this is a strong testament as to the effectiveness of this investment to create jobs in an economically depressed portion of our country. and I strongly urge support for this legislation today.",

We must come to understand a fact which our Nations competitors have long knownthat the speed with which we incorporate technological advancements in products and manufacturing is the key to longterm economic success. Make no mistake. We are unparalleled in our ability to uncover scientific and technological innovations. But we have been slow in bringing those innovations to the marketplace. Yet that process. the transfer of technology from the laboratory to the production line. is the key to effective economic competition. The KanjorskiRidge amendment would give the EDA the ability to help small businesses hit hard by the downsizing of our defense industry get access to technology that will give them a competitive edge. It provides small businesses with onestop access to federally funded new technologiesallowing them to incorporate these innovations into their manufacturing processes and products. We know that many defense dependent businesses have highly skilled workers and other valuable resources we cannot lose. We understand what it takes to help them be competitive. We know what to do. This amendment. and this bill. will put critical new technologies developed by the Federal Government in the hands of these small American businesses. where they belong. It will give them a competitive edge previously reserved for large multinationals and foreign competitors. It will help create new jobs and make us more competitive. We have an administration and a Secretary of Commerce who understand this. and who are committed to reinvigorating the EDA and to assuring that it meets its mission of helping communities and businesses like those in my State of Connecticut which have borne the brunt of the rapid changes in our defense budget. I urge my colleagues to support the KanjorskiRidge amendment and the EDA reauthorization. Cutbacks in defense spending will cost this country some 2 millions jobs by the year 2001. We need to make sure that those skilled workers can bring their talents to bear in the private sector. Support these workers. Support giving our defense dependent communities the help they need. and giving our small businesses access to the next generation of hightechnology products and processes. Support the creation of new jobs. Support a strong and vibrant economic future. Vote for this amendment and for the reauthorization of the EDA.",

I rise today to express my strong support for the reauthorization of the Economic Development Administration of the Department of Commerce. Funding EDA is renewing America. Each Federal program should be analyzed on the basis of whether or not it improves the lives of ordinary citizens at a reasonable cost. A good program should do just that. The Economic Development Administration is one such successful Government program. In the past. EDA has done much good for the district I represent. I strongly support its reauthorization. In the mid1970s. Long Beach. CA. developed plans to renovate its depressed downtown area. Public and private financing was arranged. But after 1978 the local and State public financing available was severely reduced after the passage of Proposition 13. which rolled back property taxes and thus public revenues. Shortly thereafter. a multiagency funding agreement was achieved with the Economic Development Administration as the lead agency and partners in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation. These agencies provided $40 million in grants. That was leveraged with commitments from businesses and further municipal public financing. for a total investment of approximately $3 billion. $40 million was leveraged to $3 billion. Today. downtown Long Beach is becoming an excellent place to do business. There is a major world trade center. other downtown office buildings. hotels. parking structures. theaters. restaurants. a shopping mall. and other conveniences. This redevelopment transformed downtown Long Beach into a firstclass commercial conventional entertainment area. This would not have occurred without an initial grant from EDA. EDA can also help distressed communities suffering from defense cutbacks. The Federal Government has a duty to help mitigate the pain experienced by local communities whose economy was based. in large part. on providing for the Nations defense. Reaping the peace dividend will be a slow and sometimes painful process. The California economy is undergoing dramatic changes that may be painful in the short run. EDA should act as the lead agency in focusing its energies on defense conversion. Facilitating the redeployment of assets formerly deployed by the defense establishment will have a positive economic impact in the long run. Let us support the reauthorization of the Economic Development Administration. Funding EDA is renewing America.",

I am offering this legislation in memory of my good friend and colleague. the late Mickey Leland. As most Members in this body know. Mickey devoted much of his life to improving the quality of life for children in Africa. Ive come to share not only his love for Africa but his concern for its children.

Frederick Rose showed an empty understanding of the full range of benefits that rail delivers to metropolitan areas. Transit investments carry real economic punch. as cited by New Yorks Regional Plan Association. It concluded that \"rail (transit) is working because it is reshaping metropolitan areas. attracting business and residential subcenters around rail stops. and increasing Jobs and services * * * in downtowns.\" For example $15 billion in private development has accompanied Washington D.C.s Metrorail system. In 1972. Portlands downtown air was so dirty that it violated federal health standards one out of every three days. Today. with the popular light rail system carrying 25.000 riders per week day. there are no violations. Expansion and use of rail transit is the secret to curbing urban traffic congestion. estimated to be costing drivers $40 billion of lost time a year. Its a fact that a subway train full of commuters means 900 fewer cares on the road. The cost of rail should be considered against the true cost of auto travel. The World Resources Institute says a $300 billionayear silent subsidy is fueling the explosive growth of driving. The worst example may be the artificially low price of gasoline. It costs less today then it did In 1950. accounting for inflation. What an incentive to drive alone to work. If there Is a single factor hampering the growth of transit ridership these days. it is the weak economy. Since most people use transit to go to work. high Joblessnoss rates In citios take their toll on patronage. The antidote includes the 6.000 new Jobs that will be created by $100 million in transit investment. One more thing. In his enthusiasm to disparage rail transit. Mr. Rose apparently overlooked a fact that refutes his slant: US. rail ridership actually grew 39 percent in the 15 years leading up to 1990. Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I recently received a letter from Mr. John Lillie. the chairman of American President Co.. that underscores the terrible problems facing the U.S. maritime community. Mr. Lilie and the Shipbuilders Council each focus on very important aspects of the problem: First. American shipyards are not building commercial ships. presumably because foreign governments subsidize their shipyards. Second. American shippers are seeking foreign flags. because lack of U.S. assistance makes it more profitable to do so. Third. American sailors are losing jobs. because foreign flags provide opportunities for foreign sailors. A strong merchant marine is a matter of both national and economic security. The U.S.-flag merchant fleet. which is the primary means of transporting vital military and critical raw material cargo in the event of national emergencies. the U.S. shipyard industry. which designs and constructs all Navy vessels and is a mobilization base in the event of national emergency. and domestic producers of marine equipment. which are essential to the construction of commercial and naval vessels serve essential national security functions. The U.S. shipbuilding Industry is encumbered in the international ship construction market by significant subsidies and anticompetitive practices that Impede the ability of U.S. firms to compete on a fair and equitable basis. The U.S. shipbuilding inostry encounters costs of production due to regulatory measures required by the United States that exceed the standards Imposed Internationally. The U.S.-flag merchant fleet has dwindled in size to the point that U.S.-flag vessels now carry less than 4 percent of the oceanborne trade of the United States. The U.S. shipyard industry currently has no orders for new construction of large commercial vessels and several major shipyards are experiencing severe financial conditions. and is laying olf thousands of employees. Skilled labor to crew the U.S. merchant marine and to construct new vessels is at a precariously low level. The U.S.-flag merchant fleet. the U.S. shipyard industry. and the domestic marine equipment suppliers have decreased in size to the point that the bulk sealift capability and vessel construction and repair mobilization capacity of the United States are dangerously inadequate.",

Copies of the resolution I introduced yesterday are available in each one of the Cloakrooms. It is virtually identical to that which the House voted on last July and has been updated to account for recent revelations by the Department of Justice. But there is one point I wish to bring to the attention of the Members: Yesterday Speaker FOLEY and I received a letter from the acting U.S. attorney. J. Ramsey Johnson. asking that the transcripts not be released because such release might compromise the ongoing grand jury investigation. But this mornings Associated Press reports that the supposedly confidential transcript of the investigation has already been disclosed. According to Larry Margasak of AP. \"A transcript of Rotas remarks was reviewed Wednesday by the Associated Press. Rotas investigation covered 209 pages.\" Mr. Speaker. if the Associated Press can review 209 pages of supposedly confidential transcript. why. I ask. can the American people not review the entire transcript? The question of transcript confidentiality is now moot because the transcript has already been released to a major news organization. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to read my resolution carefully and then to support it when we bring it up on the floor later on in the day.",

Our options are only three: We could do nothing and watch the deficit soar. interest rates go up. and the economic recovery falter. We might adopt the Republican alternative. which falls $70 billion short in deficit reduction. leaves most of its claimed spending cuts to be announced. and uses middleclass rhetoric to protect the tax advantages of the wealthy. Or we can support the Democrat alternative with $500 billion in real deficit reduction. deep cuts in both discretionary spending and entitlement. a fairer Tax Code. and investments and incentives to spur the economy. Mr. Speaker. these latter features are shared by both the House and Senate budget plans. We must fine tune them in conference and see them through to passage. We have had enough of the detractors and distorters. those who would perpetuate the evasions and illusions that have tripled our national debt in the last 12 years.

VI. as the \"Alvaro de Lugo United States Post Office.\" passed the House on May 23. 1994 under suspension of the rules. On July 19. 1994. H.R. 3246. to extend to the U.S. Postal Service the authority under the provisions of title 5. U.S. Code. to seek from the Office of Personnel Management [OPM] waivers of the annuity offset provisions contained in sections 8344 and 8468 of title 5. passed the House under suspension of the rules. Section 1 of H.R. 3246. as amended. would authorize the U.S. Postal Service to either request that OPM waive the annuity offset provisions of title 5 on a casebycase basis. or request that OPM delegate authority to the Postmaster General to waive the provisions in emergency or unusual circumstances. Under current law. when Federal retirees are reemployed by the Federal Government. their salaries are offset by the amount of their annuity payments. Reemployed annuitants continue to receive their monthly annuity payments. The employing agency then pays the retiree the amount of salary in excess of the amount of the annuity. and reimburses the Federal Retirement Trust Fund with the amount of the annuity. If an agency. however. wishes to have an exemption from these rules. it may request a waiver from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM]. Currently. the Postal Service does not have the option to request such a waiver from OPM. The Senate amended H.R. 4190 by adding the provisions of H.R. 3246. In addition the Senate amended H.R. 3246 to permit the Postal Service to hire military retirees and waive the reemployed annuitant restrictions in those instances as well. The Post Office and Civil Service Committee has no objection to this amendment.",

Mr. Speaker. Mr. WHITEN was elected in a special election and sworn into the House of Representatives on November 4. 1941. He did announce. on April 5 of this year. that he will retire at the end of the 103d Congress. ending a 53year career in the House of Representatives. He has served longer in the House of Representatives than any other Member in the history of the country. It is a record that will never be broken. In fact. he broke the record on January 6. 1992. and the record was held by Mr. Vincent of Georgia. To put his career in perspective for some of our younger Members. I would point out that he was sitting in the House Chamber when President Franklin Roosevelt delivered the day of infamy speech in 1941. following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. He has served as the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. subcommittee. for 43 years. and he chaired the full Committee on Appropriations for 13 years. He was such an important force in helping shape our agricultural policies that he was known for many years as the permanent Secretary of Agriculture. Mr. WIHTTEN has spoken so many times about the need to develop the natural resources of this country. and he used his position on the Committee on Appropriations to pursue that goal.

Mr. Speaker. paying tribute to our distinguished colleague from the State of Mississippi is certainly a bittersweet experience. While I join with our colleagues in expressing deep regret that he is leaving us. depriving us of his invaluable insight and experience. I also recognize that no one in this Chamber has earned a retirement and welldeserved rest more than he. On January 6. 1992. JAMIE L. WIIITTEN set a new record for longevity in the U.S. House of Representatives. As of the day. he had served longer than any Member of Congress in history. As our senior Member. we looked to him for guidance and advice. He is our living link with the pastthe last Member remaining who was in this Chamber to vote for war the day after Pearl Harbor was attacked. the last Member to recall service under Presidents Roosevelt and Truman. JAMIE WHITTENS major concern was the agricultural interests of our Nation. He was never afraid to remind us. in his words. \"agriculture affects 84 percent of the geography of this country.\" JAMIE was proud to have his name associated with rural electrification programs. irrigation projects. service road infrastructure. and bringing telephones to our farmers--to make their lives and their families tolerable. Representative WIIITTEN served for so long as chairman of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Agriculture that he is known in some circles as the permanent Secretary of Agriculture. But I know all of his colleagues throughout the years will testify to JAMIEs honesty and fairness in that position. JAMIE WHITTEN was first elected to Congress in a special election to fill a vacancy in November 1941. Today. over a half a century later. he is prepared to retire at the age of 84. Our Nation and the world have changed immeasurably since JAMIE WHITTEN first came to Congress. One thing that has not changed. however. is his reverence for the grand traditions of our Nation. and his impeccable integrity. From 1941 through 1994. JAMIE WHITTENs has been an example to all of us. Mr. Speaker. I join our colleagues in wishing a long. healthy. happy. and productive retirement to JAMIE WHITTEN. to his wife Rebecca. and to their family. They will be missed here at the Capitol.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. few Members supporting this legislation today would dispute opponents claims that gun control is no cureall for eliminating criminal activity. However. available reports indicate that not only do nearly 90 percent of Americans. and more than 80 percent of gun owners. support the Brady bill mandating a national 5working day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun. The facts also indicate that such legislation can be of assistance in fighting crime. The arguments made by Brady bill opponents that it will have no effect on crime. since criminals do not buy guns from dealers. Is not true. The facts clearly demonstrate that criminals do indeed get guns from authorized gun dealers. The Bureau of Justice statistics reported earlier this year that 27 percent of State prison inmates who had owned handguns had purchased them from legitimate gun dealers. In addition. gun traces have shown that many guns bought by criminals on the black market were also originally purchased from retail stores. Furthermore. reports from several States with waiting periods show that waiting periods work. In my own State of Maryland. a stateside 7day waiting period prevented more than 1.300 illegal purchases in 1990. In New Jersey. which has required a background check for more than 20 years. more than 10.000 convicted felons have been caught attempting to purchase ha:.dguns. A 1985 study by the Department of Juctice found that 21 percent of criminals got their guns from dealers. The Brady bill requires that the waiting period eventually be supplanted by an instant check system. But in the meantime. a 5working day waiting period will assure that handguns are sold only to those legally eligible to possess them. I urge Members to support H.R. 1025 without any weakening amendments.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I believe it is important that we bring forth statistics from States. of course. that have already had a waiting periodand I am obviously from Illinois. and we have had one thereand I just recently got the 1992 figures. which are the most recent figures that they have. which shows that out of 171.000in round figures--the people that asked for permits to purchase a gun. 1.234 of those requests were denied because of felony convictions and mental illness with the particular individual. Now I cannot give my colleagues the figures here of how many peoples lives might have been saved. but I will tell my colleagues that out of every 1.234 that were denied. no one can tell me that some lives were not saved. I think the other question we need to ask here is: \"Whats the big deal about waiting a maximum of 5 days to receive the permit for a handgun?\" I say. If you got to have a handgun within less than 5 days. maybe you ought to be talking to law enforcement. Is there some kind of a problem? Is somebody trying to assault you? Does your family need some protection? If so. maybe you ought to be looking to law enforcement rather than being worried about not being able to get the gun within the 5day period. As everyone has said here. Mr. Chairman. this bill is no panacea. but I believe it is a step in the right direction. and I think probably that is part of the problem with this bill and one of the questions we all have to resolve in our own minds. There are people here who cannot disagree that this is good legislation but are afraid of opening the door. Yes. this will open the door.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of the Brady Handgun Violence 2rotection Act. Passage of this important legislation is long overdue. Most of us are familiar with the tragedy of increasing violence that plagues our cities. New York is only one of the many areas around the country that has been particularly hard hit by the proliferation of handgun use. Gunrelated crimes have become so prevalent in our society that no place is safe. nor is anyone immune to the escalating violence. The increasing incidence of handgunrelated violence in our schools and among our Nations youth is just one disturbing example. The Brady bill is an important preventive measure addressing the rise of handgunrelated violence. How can we not seize this opportunity to stop violence before it has the chance to happen. Contrary to claims by the opposition. waiting periods and background checks do work. Twentytwo States have enacted some form of legislation similar to the provisions Included in the Brady bill. In those States. thousands of illegal purchases have been stopped. However. a national waiting period is crucial to ensuring that these efforts are not in vain. Currently. guns bought in States without waiting periods and background checks show up in the black markets of States that have labored to pass gun control legislation. such as my State of New York. This is not a definitive solution to crime. but it is an important measure that can potentially save many lives. Ninetytwo of Americans support the Brady bill. In addition. all major law enforcement organizations support this legislation. Pass the Brady bill. The Brady bill was introduced in 1987. We 69M 097Vol. 139 (PL 20)7. cannot afford to wait any longer for its passage. too many lives are at stake. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1025.",

She wrote the following: Last year. on August 29 in Wellesley. MA. my 30 year old brother died. The cause of his death was a selfinflicted gunshot wound to his heada wound which was caused by a gun he purchased just a couple of hours before he left this life. and left my sister. mother. father. brotherinlaw. and three young nieces to grieve for him. If the Brady bill had already been passed. my family and I might still have this beautiful young man in our lives. As it is now. we have only pictures and memories. The waiting period is not just a time to run a background check. It is also a cooling off period that can prevent individuals from taking impulsive actions with deadly consequences. I implore my colleagues to think about the individual life each of us may be responsible for saving by voting for the Brady bill without amendments.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. our society Is selfdestructing as a consequence of violence that engulfs families. neighborhoods and communities. Many Americans are paralyzed with fear about the prospect of becoming a victim of violence or having to live or work In close proximity to potential violence. In a November 1 hearing of violence as a public health issue. which I chaired In my Subcommittee of Human Resources and Intergovernment Relations. we received testimony that the increase in violence was directly attributable to the use of guns. Surgeon General Joycelny Elders pointed out that firearm Injuries cost the health care system almost $3 billion a year. Our own President has talked about how violence crowds our emergency rooms and drains our health resources. Additionally. gun sales are spiraling as evidenced by the number of Americans arming themselves against an anticipated but unknown assailant. Firearms have accounted for more than 90 percent of the upturn in homicides in young Americans since the mid80s. Ninetyfive percent of the increase in the homicide rate can be directly traced to guns. And in some States. teenagers are even more likely to die from a bullet than they are a traffic accident. From a public health prespective. prevention of violence is the key. We heard from witnesses who themselves were the victims of violence. All of them stressed that we need to take the guns off the streets of America. But no one expressed this more eloquently than a young promising studentathlete from my district. Ralph Green. whose leg was amputated because of a random shooting. As Ralph stated. \"if you want to save the future generations of this country. you take the guns off the street.\" We should listen to the voices of the Ralph Greens in our community and pass the Brady bill todaywithout delay and without weakening amendments.",

Mr. SCHUMER has indicated that Michigans law. which prohibits the sale of handguns to convicted felons. exempts Michigan from the 5day waiting period provisions of H.R. 1025. Restrictions on guns will do very little to reduce crime in our country. Our greater energies in our efforts to reduce crime must be more effective apprehension. quicker and stricter judicial review and sentencing. assurances that those convicted will serve their time In prison. and most importantly instilling values and moral responsibility in the minds of our Nations young people. More specifically. we need: mandatory prison sentences for the most serious offenders. sentencing laws that will not permit armed and violent felons to avoid prison through plea bargaining. mandatory life Imprisonment for a third conviction of violent or serious felony similar to the \"3 StrikesYoure Out\" Initiative. death penalty for first degree murder with aggravating circumstances. tough. determinate sentences coupled with prison release policies that require every inmate to serve no less than 85 percent of the prison sentence imposed. adequate prison capacity with authority to privatize Institutions. comprehensive effective juvenile justice reform with early intemvention for youth at risk. and comprehensive. enforceable constitutional rights for crime victims. I would also like to add. Mr. Chairman. that in trying to assure a safer society. the role of the family cannot be understated. Dedicated parents sustain families and the Nation. As models and guides for their childrens values they help solve our crime problems. By teachIng respect and hard work. families provide the key to a strong and safe economic future.",

I agree wholeheartedly something needs to be done about the crime and violence that runs rampant through our society. unfortunately visible in every dark corner. however. I do not believe that the Brady bill will have a substantial impact on crime. We need real reform. not wishful thinking.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 1025. the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act of 1993. This piece of legislation is long overdue. Over the last several years we have witnessed a precipitous increase in the rate of violent crimes involving handguns. In 1991 there were 21.505 murders in the United States. up 6 percent from 1990. Guns were Involved in 66 percent of the murders. In 1992 violent crimes have Increased by 1 percent. Firearms were the weapons used In approximately 7 of every 10 murders. A violent crime takes place every 22 seconds In America. In other words. by the time I finish my statement. approximately three violent crimes will have occurred. This Is a disgrace and I am absolutely appalled by the Increasing lack of respect for human life. Let it be known that gun violence Is not concentrated In the our cities. It is an epidemic that has reached our small towns and rural districts. Many American schools that were once places of learning and sanctuaries from violence have become shooting ranges. Our hospitals have become inundated with gun shot victims. as if they are treating wounded soldiers In a war. I see these violent occurrences and ask my colleagues if this Is what our country Is experiencinga war? H.R. 1025 takes a major step In preventing criminals from purchasing handguns and makIng our streets safer. It does not take guns away from law abiding citizens. It would simply require a 5day waiting period before the sale of a handgun In order to give local police time to check the purchasers background. In many Instances. a background check and sale will be completed in a shorter period of time. The bill specifically exempts States which already require law enforcement officials to verify the purchasers lawful right to possess a handgun. The Brady bill would not apply to my State because Tennessee already has a 15 day waiting period. Mr. Chairman. I have long held that law abiding citizens have constitutional guarantees to own firearms and that these guarantees shall be upheld. I believe that the Brady bill protects that right and ensures that guns stay in the hands of law abiding citizens.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise In strong support of the Brady bill because I know it will work. My State of California has had a 15day waiting period for several years now. and by any measure. it has been an unqualified success. Since January 1991. the California waiting period has prevented over 16.420 illegal gun purchases. including over 8.000 gun purchases by excons who had been convicted of committing an assault or a homicide. Nevertheless. this bill is merely a first step. We must address the plague of violence that has deprived every American of the peace of mind to walk our streets. Last month. the Los Angeles Times noted that 30 American soldiers died In peacekeeping operations In Somalia. and that Is a tragedy that galvanized and horrified the Nation. However. In 1992. an average of 30 people were shot to death every week in the streets of Los Angeles. This Is madness. and it must end. There is no panacea to solve this problem. Last week the House voted for more funds for prison construction. to put additional police on our streets. and to keep our schools free of violence. These are important steps. However. if we are to make our streets and neighborhoods safe again. we have to take reasonable steps to regulate the use of firearms that have no legitimate use either for the sportsman or for those who seek selfprotection. I feel that the only way to safeguard the American public from gunrelated crimes Is through commonsense firearm regulation. We must pass the Brady bill. We must pass controls on militarystyle assault weapons that are designed solely to kill both police and civilians with militarytype precision. We must pass legIslation to keep handguns and bullets from children who are not yet legally old enough to vote. We must look at innovative proposals like Senator MOYNIHANS proposal to tax certain kinds of ammunition purchases. These gun regulations are long overdue. They make common sense to my constituents. I urge this Congress to act not only on the Brady bill. but on devising a comprehensive policy to ensure that the criminals who bring terror to our streets do not have access to the guns and ammunition that are designed primarily to kill people rather than protect.",

In the State of North Carolina alone. 6.000 people died as a result of injuries Inflicted by firearms from 1988 to 1992. In the same 4 year period. 650 of my constituents were homicide victims--dying at the hands of another wielding a handgun. The time has come to try to put a stop to these needless and senseless tragedies. The nationwide instant criminal background check. one of the major provisions of this crucial legIslation. would block those individuals who should not be in possession of a handgun due to their mental state or from their criminal history from owning one. The second major provision. the 5day waiting period. would prevent Impetuous and Impulsive handgun purchases by Individualsfueled by both passion and furywhose actions most often result in tragedy. Although I am a firm believer In the rights granted to all Americans by the second amendmentI do not think that either the background check or the 5 day waiting period constitute a punishment for lawabiding citizens. If we lived In an ideal world. there would be no need for this kind of Government interventionhowever. I am sorry to report that our world today is far from ideal. My colleaguesyour support for the Brady bill will provide a glimmer of hope for the future. The Brady bill Is. however. only a single step in the joumey to reduce the amount of crime In our Nation.

Combined together. a difference can be made In the appalling level of crime in our Nation.

Most troubling is this provision which was highlighted by the Post. \"Created broadbased tax on energy that the administration says would be borne entirely by consumers.\" In case you are wondering. consumers actually include everybody. That means this tax on energy will hit everybody. and it has been estimated. as you have heard. to cost the average family up to $500 a year. and this is just one provision of the Clinton tax plan.

The law required the President to send Congress this spring a plan for achieving a multilateral comprehensive ban on the testing of nuclear weapons on or before September 30. 1996. During his campaign. President Clinton called for a test ban in support of this law. In recent days. something has gone haywire. The greedy. lifethreatening. narrowminded weapons laboratories in this country along with their sponsors in the Departments of Energy and Defense recommended to the President that the United States continue to test nuclear bombs indefinitely. although they are willing to hold the test yields below 1 kiloton. This recommendation would completely ignore the law which halts testing in 1996. It says if the new NSC staff member learned the first lesson of the Iran/Contra scandal: Read the law.

He held Republicans responsible for standing in the way of disaster relief to flood victims in the Midwest. Well. Mr. Speaker. I do not believe there is one person in this Congress. from either political party. who is not desperate to provide badly needed aid to the courageous flood victims in the Midwest. Most of my congressional district borders on the Ohio River. which has flooded communities along its banks many times in the past. so I am especially sensitive to the heartbreaking scenes we see on the news each night. All we are asking for is the opportunity to try and pass a clean bill: Legislation without extraneous spending that will provide immediate assistance to flood victims on a payasyougo basis. Instead. our only option will be to vote for more spending to be heaped on top of an already massive Federal debt with interest payments growing daily. The only option will be to vote for totally unrelated provision to authorize payments of $100 a week to innercity youths up to 1.000 miles from the floods. I understand that today we are to once again consider the same fiscally irresponsible rule that the Republicans and Democrats in the House wisely defeated last week. By playing on the emotions of the public over the past 4 days. the leadership must feel that it is in a position to politically embarrass those in the House who are trying to do what the people have sent us here to doto spend their tax dollars in a responsible way. Therefore. unless we are given the option to remove extraneous spending from the bill and to find a way to pay for the disaster relief. I will be forced again to oppose the rule. I am not happy about this. My colleagues and I deserve the right to deal with this disaster in the Midwest in a fiscally responsible way.

They are a sham. This money would not have been spent. and now they are trying to claim they are paying for it. The simple fact of the matter is that if we had not loaded it up. we would have had lower deficits in this country. The bottom line is. do not attach. do not attach these programs to emergencies. Do not let the Congress of the United States attach riders to bills like earthquake assistance. That is really the bottom line.",

I chair the Military Construction Subcommittee. which has been in decline for the past several years. We have not been able to do the things that we want to do for quality of life. which has been one of the strong things that I have tried to do in my years as chairman of the Military Construction. This year we were unable to do what we needed to do in family housing for our troops. We had some $54 million that we could not even touch in family housing that was direly needed for our troops. Now. let me tell you what would happen if the Johnson substitute had been in effect this year: The 1995 discretionary cap would have to be reduced by $12 billion. Now. that means the military construction 602 allocation for 1995 would have been reduced by some $208 million. and a lot of people that deal in billions might not say that is a lot of money. but let me tell you this type of reduction that we would have had to have taken would have resulted in cuts in the Guard and Reserve projects of some $50 million. and these are very important and strategic family housing projects that I mentioned. We would have had a further cut of some $70 million in family housing and child care centers. which goes to the very heart of quality of life for our people in the military. We would have had to cut $20 million. and that is just a few of the things we would have to cut. There are some 70 Members of this body on both sides of the aisle who came to me during this last budget series and asked for projects in my military construction budget. I am assuming that they were very vital projects. They would have had to have been drastically cut at a time when we are building down in the military. and I serve on the Defense Subcommittee. and* I feel sure the gentleman from Pennsylvania will speak in depth about this.

What a novel idea. to actually require Congress to pay for any emergency supplemental bill we pass. This amendment is a good idea for a couple of reasons. First. it will make Congress be more selective when drafting emergency spending bills. I suspect Congress would be less likely to include completely unrelated. nonemergency pork spending in emergency bills when next years appropriations would be lower by that amount. Also. it is simply good public policy to begin paying for the bills we pass. With the budget deficit over $200 billion and national debt over $4 trillion. we simply cannot afford to continue putting off our bills onto our children and grandchildren. It is time we realize that the fiscal crisis is the biggest emergency facing this country. Unless we get our financial house in order. we literally wont be able to afford the next hurricane. the next flood. or the next earthquake. The Johnson amendment is the best way to ensure that Congress will pay for these emergencies now. and will be able to continue paying for them in the future.

Let me just basically summarize the problem. the flaw. in this bill and the reason we urge its defeat. First of all. Mr. Chairman. this bill repeals those provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. which exempted emergency spending from the discretionary spending cap. Second. the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas would create something he calls a look back requiring that in the later fiscal year all emergency spending above the discretionary spending cap in the prior fiscal year be offset by an equal reduction in discretionary spending in that second fiscal year. A look back. However. Mr. Chairman. because emergency spending would no longer be exempt. due to this bill. from the emergency spending cap. emergency spending in excess of the cap in the first fiscal year would trigger sequestration. so we would have a cut in that year by virtue of sequestration. Second. in the following fiscal year the Johnson look back provisions would mandate. dictate. that this same breach. this same excess. be cut again. reduced again. from discretionary spending. so what we have here. unintentionally. I am sure. but nevertheless it is the plain consequence of this bill. flawed in the drafting. is a double cut. a double dip. which certainly we do not wish to decree by passing this amendment. So. I urge defeat of this amendment and the creation of a serious mistake.",

I believe that we have already taken too much money out of the defense budget. and it is terrible to me that we even talk about thinking about it. However it is important that we consider paying for our finances as we go along. We have to realize there are two emergencies facing this country. those that are caused by circumstances out of control and one the body has created itself. and that is the $4.5 trillion national debt. We do not have the power to stop unforeseen emergencies. and so we can only offer help to those in need. But we in Congress have the power to reduce our national debt. and so far we have ignored the task. Members have said the deficit is going down. but that is short term. We need to focus our sights on the long term. and by the Presidents own predictions the deficit and debt will rise in the outyears. Mr. Chairman. over the past 4 years. $90 billion has been added to the debt through emergency supplementals. The Presidents proposed spending. $320 billion for new programs and figures. show that by 1998 $1.5 trillion will be added to the debt. This is not how a responsible Congress acts. We have got to reduce our expenditures. and change our spending habits. and show the American people that we are accountable for our actions and care about the future of this country. That is why Members ought to vote yes on this amendment and start us down the road toward fiscal responsibility. In answer to some of the questions today. todays rules already preclude any point of order on spending over 602(b) limits. so. when we waive all points of order. which Rules does on every supplemental report. and conference report. then there is not any way for spending to be addressed except by the Johnson amendment.

The act will provide $25 million in funding for trauma care programs in fiscal year 1994. with continued funding until fiscal year 1996. The act also makes revisions to the program to include trauma patients on the trauma care systems advisory board and allow trauma systems to cross State boarders when regional systems are more appropriate than State systems. I am an original supporter of the Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act of 1990 which encourages the development of regional trauma systems. and I supported the ADAMHA Reorganization Act which provides financial help to trauma care centers to ease their burden of providing uncompensated care. I also requested a GAO study that examined the extent of and reasons for trauma care center closures in major urban areas. including Detroit. MI. The study. which was released in May 1991. documented that the primary reasons for closures were lack of payment by persons without insurance and low Medicaid reimbursement rates.

Dawson Springs. a town with a population of 3.129 residents. is located on the Tradewater River in western Kentucky coal territory. Originally the site of a native American trading village. this tract of land was initially known by settlers as \"Tradewater Bend.\" Although the arrival of the railroad in 1872 resulted in a new name. \"Tradewater Station.\" the river continued to be the regions most identifiable characteristic. Only 2 years later the area was renamed once again. this time permanently. This final change in identification reflected the influence of the local Dawson family. The dawn of the 20th century witnessed a golden age in the history of Dawson Springs. This time represented a renaissance of sorts in which the region welcomed dramatic growth and overall prosperity. Unfortunately. the onset of both World War I and World War II interrupted this development and significantly eroded the towns productivity. The demise of the railroad as the primary mode of transportation compounded Dawson Springs dilemma. One of the most admirable qualities of the Dawson Springs community has been its ability to withstand adversity over time. Despite the towns economic and psychological setbacks in the middle of this century. Dawson Springs has recently made a notable comeback. Today. this fine community boasts strong industrial relations with several large employers. At the same time. Dawson Springs has maintained the enviable qualities of a small town lifestyle. Revitalization has been accompanied by a spirit of preservation: the towns past success has been a source of inspiration and. predictably. a model for the future. I commend Dawson Springs resiliency and efforts to improve upon its already admirable progress. More importantly. I wish to praise those individuals who represent the backbone of this industrious and positive attitude that thrives in Dawson Springs. Mr. President.

To qualify. each of these students combined creativity and facts writing essays entitled \"Wyoming CoalRevenues. Resources and Jobs for the State and Its Citizens.\" This Wyoming Coal Information Committees essay scholarship program offers the opportunity for youth to understand the coal industry and coals contributions to the States economy and environment. All of the top essayists wrote excellent pieces focusing on how the industry benefits each and every person in Wyoming through tax revenues that fund schools. roads. and other vital services. Winner Brent Presser. for example. pointed out that coal contributes to the State an amount equal to $560 per Wyoming resident. while runnerup Vanessa Hill noted that each job at a coal mine produces the need for more than two jobs in surrounding communities. Tim Tysdal wrote that the industry has a minimal impact on the environment since the States 29 coal mines use only about 8 square miles of Wyomings 97.000 square mile land base. Janna Reinhart summed things up by noting that coal is more than just a source of heat and energy in Wyoming. it is an integral part of everyday life. In short. each student did an outstanding job illustrating the contributions coal has made to our States economy and environment. Each of the scholarship recipients has a bright future on the horizon. Prosser plans to attend Creighton University studying premed.

Schools. once a pillar of safety in the community. are no longer exempt from this senseless tragedy. Instead. students commonly witness shootouts in the confines of their classrooms. As a result. parents and teachers are forced to live in perpetual fear of the next violent outburst. This mindnumbing violence must be stopped. In response to gun violence. the Joyce Foundation of Chicago recently funded a Louis Harris poll which exam ned the thoughts of the American people on gunrelated violence and what Congress can do. The findings showed that 93 percent of adults see an increase in teenagers being killed by guns. while 8 in 10 feel that the problem of guns and young people has become a matter of urgency. The Harris poll also indicated that almost 90 percent of Americans support the Brady bill. Even National Rifle Association members support the bill by a margin of 2 to 1. A large portion of the population also supports a complete ban on handguns. While I may not agree with all of those polled. I am certainly encouraged that most Americans have taken notice and are supportive of congressional action to reduce the level of gun violence. I would also like to point out recent editorials from both the Chicago Tribune and Chicago SunTimes. which cite this study and urge immediate action. I am in full agreement. and stand wholeheartedly committed to working toward reducing the spiraling problem of gun violence.

But I have some questions for the President about this term \"tax fairness.\" Is it fair to pass a tax which will hit not only the rich. but also the middle and lower classes? That is what the Presidents energy tax will do. Is it fair to have a tax increase which will slow economic growth. kill jobs. and hurt the private sector? That is what the increase in the capital gains tax will do. Is It fair to increase taxes on the elderly. some of whom struggle to make ends meet? That is what the Social Security tax will do. Is this what the President means by tax fairness? Mr. Speaker. Bill Clintons version of tax fairness reminds me of Winston Churchills definition of socialism: An equal sharing of misery.

Since 1868. the church has been tireless in its efforts to improve the welfare of those In the community. The years under current Pastor H.

Further. the church has provided members of the Warren community with a place to go to seek refuge from modem day life and receive spiritual guidance and enlightenment. While the church has gone through a variety of changes through its 125year history. its commitment to improving the parish has remained constant. Initially founded as a church for the Germanspeaking people of Warren. Irrespective of their religious beliefs. the church has grown to become a center for the Lutheran following in Ohio. Over its history. the church has gone through many changes. The location of the building has changed. the name has been altered. and even the language spoken at its services has been switched from German to English. Some things. however. have remained the same. St. Pauls commitment to the community and to glorifying the name of the Lord have been central to the church since its inception and have not changed In the least. As a result. the church continues to be a focal point of community activity and good works. By committing themselves to these noble pursuits. the church has earned the admiration of the community and has garnered a host of supporters wishing them another 125 years of success.

George E. Hatfield. brought his family to Mecosta County and settled on the 160acre site which Is Mildred and Carletons current home. Through hard work and strong family support. they expanded their farm to 700 acres. For over 50 years they endured the forces of nature. Through it all. hard work and patience prevailed. and Carleton and Mildreds efforts are truly a success story. Mildred and Carleton have been a model of tenacity and values to their family and community. Laboring long hours. they worked the soil to reap many bountiful harvests. and contributed Immeasurably to those lives they touchedwhether through their work on the farm or community service. Mildred and Carleton proudly boast a daughter and 2 sons. which have given them 12 grandchildren. One son. Donald. and two of Donalds sons continue the dairy operation today. Their other son.

Many of us campaigned last year on a message of change. The publics trust In Congress was at an historic low. and the demand for political reform was high. It seemed as though Congress was more responsive to special interests than to the interests of average Americans.

After taking over a team that averaged 5 wins and 14 losses a year before his arrival. Krizancic turned the program around and has had 10 winning seasons in his last 11. He has compiled an amazing 170 win and 85 loss record at Girard and has led the team to four Mahoning Valley Conference championships. In recognition of these stunning achievements. Krizancic has been named Coach of the Year six times by his colleagues. Krizanclcs tournament record Is no less stellar at 50 wins and 12 losses. His efforts at the helm of his basketball team have yielded 10 sectional championships. 3 district chainplonships. I regional championship. and 1 State championship.

I have no doubts that Coach Krizanclc will be wildly successful at Mentor High and will likely do for them what he has done for Girard.

The D--8 was returning the soldiers from a peacekeeping mission In the Middle East when the aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Gander en route to Fort Campbell. KY. As many of you may remember. the ensuing Investigation of the crash was mired in controversy and criticism for lack of oversight and responsibility. The Canadian Aviation Safety Board conducted the Investigation In accordance with International law. and ruled that the cause of the crash was due to excessive wing Icing. However. four of the boards members argued with the findings because of the strong possibility that an Inflight fire or explosion occurred. This legislation would establish a commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the crash. including the role of U.S. Federal agencies involved In the Investigation. the role of the Canadian Government In the investigation and the possibility that the crash was an act of terrorism. The United States continues to be asked by the international community to send its men and women In uniform In harms way to perform peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. We still have a presence in Somalia. and now Macedonia. The use of chartered aircraft to transport these troops to the far corners of the world remains a prevalent practice by DOD. We need to know the truth about the Gander crash before we put another soldier on a chartered aircraft.

I am proud to say there Is a health care system In my district that has gone a long way toward making our goals a reality for working families throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. This system Is the Geisinger Foundation. The Gelsinger Foundation in Danville. PA. takes a regional approach to health care. with over 500 physicians caring for a large portion of the families In central and northeastern part of the State. The foundation was established in 1915 as the George F. Gelsinger Memorial Hospital. today it Is a broad network of 530 salaried physicians In hospitals and clinics around the area. The health plan operating under the Geisinger Foundation Is a rural. notforprofit corporation with roughly 100.000 members. This structure allows enrollees to receive top quality health care at an affordable price. Cost control comes from an emphasis on primary care. preventive medicine. and a professional culture of conservative family doctor medicine. As the New York Times has noted. the Gelsinger plan \"has the lowest rates in Pennsylvania * * * with monthly premiums this year of $109.70 for individuals and $285.22 for families for a plan covering nearly everything but prescriptions.\" Accessibility Is another key to Gelsingers success: The roundation has established rural medical practices across the region. and in accordance with Its charitable charter. Geisinger physicians provide service to anyone. regardless of their ability to pay.

The chairman of the Subcommittee on Health in the Committee on Ways and Means scribbled across the top of the letter that he had received. and sent it back to the ranking committee member on the Committee on Ways and Means. that \"This is pure. unadulterated * * *\" and I cannot finish the sentence here in the House. Apparently the congressional Democrats and President Clinton are going to meet again next week to plot ways to pass health care reform without Republican help. because I guess they do not want it. Since the Democrats seem to be so out of touch with what middleclass America wants from health care reform. let me give them some hints. First of all. the American people want reform that preserves the high quality of our current system. They want malpractice reform to keep health care dollars from going to lawyers. They want portability reform. a change in preexisting condition requirements. and other insurance reforms that will promote universal access to private health insurance. The American people do not want to pay a huge payroll tax. They do not want 98.000 more Federal bureaucrats to run it. Mr. Speaker. the people want reform now that fixes the problems of our current system without creating a whole new set of problems to be fixed later.",

With outlays from prioryear BA and other completed actions. the Senate bill is within the subcommittees section 602(b) allocation. I particularly appreciate the subcommittees support for a number of projects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico. The bill strongly supports technology transfer efforts by our DOE national laboratories. The committee has provided a total of $243 million to carry out the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989. which I coauthored. The funding initiatives in this bill will encourage the integration of the scientific and technical expertise of DOEs national laboratories with U.S. industry to enhance their capabilities and their ability to compete in an expanding global market. Moreover. it will provide support for the development of technologies to solve some very complex environmental problems in the weapons complex. The Senate report does an excellent Job in describing how the DOE laboratories are wellsuited to take on these significant challenges. In particular. the Senate report includes language I suggested acknowledging that partnerships between the DOE labs and small- and mediumsized business represent an important opportunity to increase U.S. global competitiveness through the development and application of generic industrial technologies. The report also states that technology transfer efforts related to environmental restoration and waste management are an appropriate use of these funds. I commend the subcommittee chairman. the Senator from Louisiana. and the ranking minority member. the Senator from Oregon. for bringing this bill to the floor within its section 602(b) allocation and the spending cap.",

I thank Senator JOHNSTON and the committee for clarifying the Corps of Engineers obligation to reimburse the State of Delaware for the costs of constructing the highway approaches to the bridge. as well as the St. Georges Bridge itself. Congress has previously determined that it was the corps responsibility to reimburse the State of Delaware for the new bridge crossing the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal at St. Georges in Delaware. This year. in direct conflict with its own previous position. the intent of Congress and the States federally approved plans. the corps attempted to revise its duties to the state. The corps claimed that it was not responsible for the cost of approaches to the bridge. This unilateral reinterpretation would have shifted $40 million in costs to Delawares taxpayers. The language included with the appropriations for the Corps of Engineers restates congressional understanding of the corps obligation to direct the $14 million provided for fiscal year 1994as well as for funds provided in previous and future appropriations--to the costs of building the approaches to the bridge as well as the bridge itself. This report language is not only consistent with the agreement for the bridge under construction. but is consistent with previous projects in which the Federal Government has provided bridges over the canal in fulfillment of its clear legal obligation to provide \"good and sufficient crossings.\" The State believes that attempting to build a bridge without access to it fails to meet the agreement reached between Delaware and the Federal Government. and also fails to meet the test of common sense. I share this view and am pleased the Energy and Water Subcommittee. under the leadership of its distinguished chairman. also agrees with the States position.",

I rise today in support of the Hefley amendment to H.R. 2442. and I want to commend my friend. the gentleman from Colorado. for leading the fight for eliminating this agency. Despite the optimistic feports from the administration. our dsficit is still going up. Four hundred billion dollars by the year 2000 is projected. Congress should be looking for ways to eliminate inefficiency and wasteful programs. not reauthorizing them after 10 years. Congress need look no further than the EDA to begin to find an appropriate place in which to eliminate a few dollars from this budget that we are not going to be able to afford in a number of years. Let me also add at this time that I support the amendments reducing or eliminating the funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission. This is a good example of why the gentleman from Minnesota and I introduced the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994. We can go on and on and on trying to eliminate certain programs to try to cut the deficit. and we always lose. We do always lose. so that is why we have combined all these cuts. $550 billion over a 5year period. so we could vote up or down on one piece of legislation. and this exact amendment was included in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994. I would just say to the Members that if we do not try to get a handle somewhere on how we are going to reduce spending. our children and our grandchildren are going to suffer. There is no longer any way that we can continue to ask the American taxpayers to put more revenues into the Federal Treasury through more taxes.

One of the speakers said that he gets calls from all kinds of people saying support this project and support that project. And that is our mentality up here. that whatever your little project is throughout the United States. whether it be a sewer system or whatever it be. that the Federal Government ought to pay for it. It is your system. But somehow or other. the Federal Government ought to pay for it. Another thing in the bill that I think we ought to be aware of when we throw around the figure $386 million. is there is also a phrase in there that says \"and such additional amounts.\" That has been scored. and the cost of this bill that we are trying to eliminate is $422 million. not $386 million.",

I rise in strong support of the compromise reached between the House Banking Committee and the House Public Works and Transportation Committee to reauthorize the Economic Development Administration. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose Congressman HEFLEYS amendment to terminate the EDA. The two series of EDA grants contained in this legislationboth the public works and economic adjustment grants--are vital to our efforts to restore economically distressed areas like the cities of Paterson and Passaic. which are located in my congressional district in northern New Jersey. Communities like these need to have investment in their infrastructure in order to attract new business and industry and to create more jobs for the people who live there. It is essential that we provide these distressed communities the support they need to rebuild their infrastructure and address the longterm problems created by economic deterioration. high unemployment. massive plant closures. and defense industry cutbacks. Many of the problems that have plagued the EDA for the past 12 years have been corrected in the compromise bill we have before us today. We have improved upon the grant criteria. we have improved the procedures for processing applications. we have clearly defined EDAs mission. and we have made sure that applicants who receive EDA moneys have established longterm strategies to best address local economic problems. This legislation is a modest investment in Americas future. and it deserves your support. I want to thank Chairman KANJORSKI for all his efforts to bring this compromise measure to the floor today. and I urge all my colleagues to oppose any amendments which would undermine the EDA authorization levels or reforms that have been incorporated into this bill.",

The amendment I have at the desk would cut the additional $10 million from the EDA and restore the Presidents funding level. It is no secret that I am not a fan of the EDA. I think the program is ripe for abuse. I am also not a fan of our convoluted appropriation process. We budget. we authorize and we appropriate. Then we conference and reconcile. At each step. the spending seems to grow. The authorization for the EDA is a good example. The President sent his budget request to Congress. and he asked for a significant increase for the EDA. Then the Banking and Public Works Committees got together to craft a bill. and they added a little more. The summer. the appropriations will get their shot. Finally. we will probably pass an emergency appropriation bill this fall that will include still more spending. In the end. its little wonder we have had continuous deficits for the past 25 years. Mr. Chairman. this amendment is an attempt to stem that tide by rolling back the spending level for the EDA to the level budgeted by the President. As it is. the Presidents budget projects a $165 billion deficit. There is no reason to increase that deficit. even if its just $10 million. The amendment I have at the desk will cut a total of $10 million from the EDAs funding for next year. This cut includes $3 million from the salaries and expenses account. $3 million from the grants for public works and development facilities. $2 million from the technical assistance and economic development planning. and $2 million from the special economic development and adjustment assistance authorization. In case someone is worried that these cuts are too draconian. I would point out that if my amendment is adopted. total spending by the EDA will increase by $163 million over the amount provided in last years Commerce. Justice. State appropriation bill. Authorization for the salaries and expenses portion alone will increase by almost $10 million. Mr. Chairman. my amendment cuts $10 million from a program whose funding has practically doubled in the last 2 years. it restores the Presidents budget level for the EDA. and I hope the Members will support it.",

What we attempted to do in crafting this bill and reaching a bottom line of financial assistance was to understand that we will never adequately understand the needs that will impact a community. as established in. say. May. by the end of December. And unfortunately. last year was a cruel reminder of how little control we have over this Earth and. therefore. how little control we have over the needs that may be brought forth by communities undergoing such tragedies as the floods in the Midwest. the earthquakes. the fire disasters. and. yes. in fact. the base closures. Certainly. I stand here as one who wishes I could predict how the Base Closures Commission set .to begin in the very near future will impact communities and those that are now dealing with only understanding the disastrous effects on their economies of prior base closures.

The Committee on Public Works and Transportation got hold of it and raised the figure to $441 million. Then the Committee on Banking. Finance and Urban Affairs dealt with it. and they reached the figure of $402 million. The compromise was $422 million. and. yes. in that $422 million there is the CBQs scoring for $80 million as kind of a contingency sum. such funds as may be necessary. But we know in this body that when we have floods on the Mississippi River or we have earthquakes in Los Angeles. we have special appropriations to add to this.

I believe owe a debt of gratitude to Senator INOUYE. the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. I am very pleased that we have succeeded in forging an agreement which meets the budget caps for new budget authority and fiscal year 1994 outlays. while generously providing for our Nations real national security needs. This bill provides $77.1 billion for operations and maintenance. Although that is $1.6 billion below the budget request. most of the reductions come from pricing adjustments which reflect lower than expected costs for items such as fuel and foreign currency. The committee added over $1 billion to the budget request to improve readiness. with funding for activities such as unit readiness training. This bill is consistent with the recent amendment that cut over $700 million from the budget request for the strategic defense initiative. which the Senate approved during consideration of this years Defense authorization bill. The research and development and procurement accounts receive over $120 billion. One decision made by our committee which I believe to be of the highest importance is the allocation of over $1 billion not reauested by the Defense Department to :und a 2.2percent pay raise for our military personnel effective January 1. 1994. The men and women serving our country in uniform. whether on active duty or in the Guard and Reserve components. are far and away the most important safeguard of our national security. I am deeply convinced. and I think any commander in the field would agree. that the unmatched excellence of the men and women serving under arms in the U.S. military is our greatest national military asset. and the greatest deterrent to any potential adversary of the United States. Far more than star wars or the B2 bomber. it is the world renown for the valor and professionalism of our Armed Forces which will give pause to those who might consider challenging our vital national interests. The 2.2percent pay raise will both acknowledge and reward our outstanding service members. Just as importantly. it will help preserve the most important resource of our Armed Forces--an unsurpassed tradition of excellence.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. during Senate consideration of the fiscal year 1994 Department of Defense appropriations bill. the junior Senator from Arizona made a presentation to the Senate concerning what he views to be unauthorized appropriations. and used material developed at his request by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. Senator MCCAINs arguments were rebutted quite forcefully and effectively by Senators INOUYE and STEVENS. and I saw no need to participate in the dlscussion at the time. Upon reading the CRS study prepared for Senator MCCAIN. however. I was eoncerned that it did not reflect a thorough understanding of appropriations law or of Senate procedure. I discussed the matter with the Librarian of Congress. and suggested that perhaps the American Law Division of CRS might take another look at the issue with these legal and procedural questions in mind. Last Friday. CRS Director Joseph Ross sent me a memorandum prepared by the American Law Division on the subject of authorization vs. appropriations. As we consider the conference report on the fiscal year 1994 Defense appropriations bill. I thought it useful to bring this memorandum to the attention of the Senate. I will emphasize two points the memorandum makes. First. the rules of the Senate provide that the Committee on Appropriations may recommend appropriations in excess of amounts authorized. or indeed in the complete absence of authorization. Of course. the Senate is free to reject such a recommendation. but the Committee on Appropriations is free to make it.

I would like to extend my congratulations as well as my appreciation for her efforts on behalf of Arizonas children. As we all know. teachers are the backbone of our educational system. They are alltoooften unsung heroes on the frontlines of Americas efforts to educate our children. to steer them away from the negative influences of drugs and gangs and to equip them and inspire them to seek a better future through education. Margo Stone exemplifies the finest of Arizonas and our Nations teachers. Margo Stone has been teaching special education in Arizona schools since 1983. In 1990. she came to Centennial Elementary School. Renate Krompasky. her nominating principal. is quick to extol her qualifications: \"Margo is an exemplary teacher who can combine the scientific principles of teaching with human relations skills and creativity to make learning come alive for her special education students. It is amazing how confident the students become after a year of working with Margo Stone.\" Krompaskys support is shared by Stones colleagues who praise her not only because of her dedication to her students. but for the assistance she provides to other teachers. Stone believes that she brings to her classroom the confidence that her own teachers gave to her throughout her life. She no doubt passes this gift of selfconfidence and drive for success on to her students. Stones accomplishments continue beyond the classroom into her community. She has been a block captain in a neighborhood crimeprevention program. the Centennial Schools representative for the United Way Campaign. and a participant in the March of Dimes Walk America. In addition. she donates her time helping to prepare hot meals and brown bag lunches for the Salvation Army. She is also a member of the Council for Exceptional Children. the Learning Disabilities Association of America and Arizona and a delegate to the Arizona Education Association. Margo Stone deserves to be commended for her devotion to improving the lives of our children. I ask my colleagues to join me. along with many Arizona citizens. in honoring Margo Stone for her excellence as a teacher and role model.",

Unfortunately. that bill has been stalled in a conference committee since that time. Last week. the conference reached what it thought was a final bill. Regrettably. the other body rejected that proposal and sent the bill back to conference. It is my understanding that the conference has not even met since that time. The Senate members of the conference have done a fine job representing the Senate in their efforts to produce a final bill. Unfortunately. however. this process has taken entirely too much time. While the other body spends time discussing the merits of an extraneous matter. thousands of Rhode Islanders and hundreds of thousands of other Americans are forced to wait. They wait to find out if and when their Representatives will act on their behalf. While they wait. they plan and worry about making ends meet until we do act. Not a single day passes without my offices in Providence and Washington receiving calls from unemployed Rhode Islanders. all wanting to know if. by chance. Congress finally passed the bill. Not only are these people trying to pay the rent and buy the groceries. but as time goes by they now want to know if a Thanksgiving dinner can be prepared and whether Christmas and Hanukkah gifts can be bought. It is impossible to explain the peculiarities of the legislative process to someone worrying about feeding their family. Mr. President. I voted for the Gramm amendment that appears to be at the center of current debate. While the amendment does have merit. It should not. must not. kill this essential legislation. If Members of the other body feel strongly about the issues contained in the Gramm amendment. I would urge the joint leadership to provide them with a separate vote on this matter in January. I am very concerned that in the press to go home for the year this important issue will be lost in the shadows of other more high profile matters. It would be unconscionable if we adjourn before passing and sending to President Clinton a final version of the emergency unemployment compensation legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to explain my vote against the motion to cut off debate on the nomination of Janet Napolitano to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Arizona. In my view. Ms. Napolitano played a key role in an incident which disqualified her from a position of public trust. A little over 2 years ago. the Judiciary Committee took the deposition of a witness. Ms. Hoerchner. during its deliberations on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. For some reason. the committee not only permitted Ms. Hoerchner and her attorney to attend the deposition. but also allowed Ms. Napolitano. the attorney for another witness. before the committee. to attend the deposition. A careful reading of the transcript of the deposition of Ms. Hoerchner on October 10. 1991. reveals that. following an offtherecord conference with Ms. Napolitano and requested by Ms. Napolitano. Ms. Hoerchner modified her preceding testimony in ways to make it far less damaging to Ms. Napolitanos client and far more damaging to Justice Thomas. I believe this intervention was inappropriate. Ms. Napolitano has refused to disclose the substance of her conversation with Ms. Hoorchner to the Judiciary Committee. She claims that the conversation is protected by attorneyclient privilege. claiming that her client. Ms. Hill. and the other witness. Ms. Hoerchner. shared a common interest. I disagree with her analysis. Ms. Napolitano has given no hint as to what that common interest might be. There was no apparent legal or economic interests Ms. Hill and Ms. Hoerchnor held in common. Rather. they were supposedly disinterested witnesses in a proceeding in which neither had any apparent personal interest. Their testimony was designed solely to inform the Senate about a nominee. In my view. the two did not share a common interest. and thus her defense of attorneyclient privilege should fail. Because I believe that Ms. Napolitano was centrally involved in this unfortunate incident. I will vote against cloture on this nomination.",

Paul spent 6 years in the Navy before moving to the Office of the Secretary of Defense in 1968. For the past 25 years. Paul Dube has served in the Office of the Comptroller. which is the primary office in the Defense Department responsible for preparing the defense budget each year. In the Office of the Comptroller. Paul has served as Director for Military Personnel programs. as Director for Operations. with oversight of the operation and maintenance accounts which fund training and other crucial readiness activities. as Assistant Deputy Comptroller. and. since 1988. as Deputy Comptroller for Program and Budget. Paul is a charter member of the Senior Executive Service. As Deputy Comptroller for Program and Budget. Paul has served as the senior official assisting the Comptroller in the preparation and execution of the defense budget in a time of extraordinary change and extraordinary challenge. As the defense budget has declined in real terms each year since 1985. the Department of Defense has made significant reductions in personnel and force structure while at the same time undertaking military operations such as Operation Just Cause in Panama. Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. and Operation Desert Storm. to name just a few. The Department has met these challenges through the dedicated efforts of people like Paul Dube. Although career civil servants like Paul Dube are for the most part unknown to the public. those of us responsible for the oversight of the Defense Department recognize the contribution Paul Dube has made to the difficult job of getting the best defense possible from our declining defense budget.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation that is intended to ease the financial burden of the agricultural community in complying with the everincreasing number of environmental regulations imposed by Federal. State. and local governments. There are many reasons to support the agricultural community in this endeavor. American agricultural provides the safest. most reliable. and lowest cost food and fiber supply in the world. The food and fiber industry from farm to retail is Americas single largest industry. This industry employs nearly 21 million people. almost 19 percent of the Nations total workforce. and accounts for nearly onefifth of our gross domestic product [GDP]. In spite of its importance. however. farm income is at record low levels on a perdecade basis. and. while there has recently been some recovery. projections for the 1990s anticipate further decline. Agriculture is also the subject of the continuing upward spiral of expensive governmental regulation. The legislation that I am introducing today addresses the expense of current and proposed water and air quality regulations with which taxpayers engaged in agriculture or agricultural related businesses are required to comply. This )ill would provide a 15 percent. agricultural environmental tax credit for purchases of machinery. equipment. and structures for which the primtry purpose is to comply with environmental regulations. The credit would be limited to $15.000 in any given year and to $150.000 today for any taxpayer. A farmer or an agricultural related business would receive the credit for investment in structures and equipment including. for example. livestock wastehandling systems. constructed wetlands. terraces. notill planters and other conservation farm equipment. and containment dikes. These are items for which cost ranges from $200 to $100.000. sizable sums of money for a North Dakota farmer with an average per farm income of $20.003.00 in19.1. The credit would help alleviate some of the financial burden of complying with these provisions. This legislation that I am introducing with my colleagues. Mr. DASCIIIE and Mr. GRASSLEY. will help the rural community while furthering the goals of controlling environmental pollution and conserving Americas soil and water resources. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of this bill be printed in the REconI).",

The Big Guy is 30.5 feet in length. 11.9 feet in breadth. has a depth of 5 feet. and is selfpropelled. The vessel was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Galvin of East Providence. RI. who would now like to use the boat for a charter business. When the owners purchased the boat. they were unaware of the coastwise trade and fisheries restrictions of the Jones Act. They assumed that there were no restrictions on engaging the vessel in such a limited operation. However. due to the fact that the vessel has previously been partially foreign owned. it did not meet the requirements for a coastwise license endorsement in the United States. Such documentation is mandatory to enable the owners to use the vessel for its intended purpose. The owners of Big Guy are thus seeking a waiver of the existing law because they wish to use the vessel for the purpose of engaging in limited commercial use. Their desired intentions for the vessels use will not adversely affect the coastwise trade in U.S. waters. If they are granted this waiver. it is their intention to comply fullS with U.S. documentation and safety requirements.

This language is only going to waste billions of taxpayer dollars and deny the opportunity for thousands of semiskilled workers to get the experience they need to advance in the construction field. The Subcommittee on Labor Standards. Occupational Health and Safety has already held one hearing on reform of the DavisBacon Act and at least one additional hearing is planned prior to subcommittee markup. There are currently several proposals to reform the actincluding H.R. 2042. of which I am a cosponsor. Any reform of the DavisBacon Act is most appropriately considered by the authorizing committee of jurisdiction. A legislative rider to an appropriations bill is neither the procedure nor the place for debate on such a complex and controversial issue as DavisBacon reform. Helpers are semiskilled workers who work on construction projects under the supervision of higher skilled journeymanlevel workers. After nearly a decade of litigation over the use of helpers. the helper classification for DavisBacon projects was linally Implemented by the Department of Labor last spring. Both the U.S. District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals have found that the helper classification is totally consistent with the language and purpose of the DavisBacon Act. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the use of helpers will save $600 million and create 250.000 jobs annually. This provision will now increase the total costs for Federal construction by 1.6 percent. The taxpayers will be forced to pay approximately $600 million more over the next year. This represents an unwise use of Federal dollars and it flies in the face of attempts to reinvent government as we know it today. Moreover. it will deny opportunities to disadvantaged workers. The helper regulations have withstood years of challenges in the court system and have been found to be entirely in line with the Intent of the DavisBacon Act. Prohibiting the use of helpers will deny entrylevel jobs to those who desperately need the opportunity to move forward and get the skills necessary for a career in the construction industry.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise In support of the bill. H.R. 2518. the Labor/ Health and Human Services appropriations conference report for 1994. The report before us addresses difficult choices because of our evertightening discretionary budget. It is not all that I would like. I had hoped that with new leadership from President Clinton and the elimination of the firewalls that separated defense and domestic spending. we could have had more resources for the important programs aimed at ensuring the education and welfare of our people. particularly our children. The Labor/HHS appropriations report would attempt to address the continuing shortfalls in education and labor programs produced by 12 years of neglect by Republican administrations. The reality is that it is very difficult to reverse the decline in our ability to address our distressing social deficit when we are faced with an overwhelming fiscal deficit. The Appropriations Committee. led by the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky. Mr. NATCHER. had done the very best it could under trying circumstances. On the positive side. Pelt grants will remain at $2.300. The appropriation for dislocated worker programs would be doubled to $1.1 billion. The Department of Labor estimates 545.000 would be able to participate. Again. however. the number of dislocated workers scrambling for jobs in the economy is enormous. We are facing auto plant closures. the migration of jobs abroad. displacements caused by our efforts to clean our air and to protect dwindling forests in the Northwest. and. of course. dislocations if NAFTA passes. The Head Start Program. one of the items particularly targeted to increased funding by President Clinton. would receive $5 million more than in 1993. That is a good start toward the Presidents goal of providing Head Start to every eligible child. We hope and expect that more funding will be made available when the Committee on Education and Labor reauthorizes Head Start.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I voted against the conference report for H.R. 2518. Labor. Health and Human Services. and Education appropriations for fiscal year 1994. While the bill included programs that would benefit millions of Americans. in the end I had to stand by my pledge to cut spending and reduce the budget deficit. Spending on certain programs and services could have been cut more deeply without negatively impacting essential programs. Too many areas of the conference report contained funding levels higher than what the administration requested. some of which were singled out as possible budget cutting areas by the Congressional Budget Office. It was extremely difficult to oppose a bill that contained funding for programs I ardently support. If separate votes had been held for each provision of the bill. I would have supported funding for numerous programs and services covered in the bill. including the following: Head Start. child care. employment and training. AIDS research. local health centers. several elementary. secondary. and higher educational programs. and elderly. veterans. and family services. Had it been possible. I would have supported these programs and. in fact. would have liked to see increased spending in some areas. However. when voting on an omnibus spending bill like todays. it Is Impossible to distinguish irreplaceable programs from those that could have been cut. When it came to a vote. I decided I could not In good conscience abandon my work toward reducing the deficit.",

This year. the conterees have once again managed to set priorities and make hard choices. The result is a bill that continues to fund a lot of good programs. as well as to meet new needs. H.R. 2518 funds everything from our jobs programs. to the research programs in the National Institutes of Health. to key educational programs. to community health centers. It is also the major source of funds for critical womens programs. like maternal and child health. breast and cervical cancer research. and family planning. Child care programs. child support enforcement programs. Head Start. toster care and adoption assistance support services. nutrition services for our elderly citizensall these key support systems are dependent upon the funding in this bill. Nearly threequarters of the money in this bill supports entitlement programsprograms whose costs we must paylike Social Security and Medicare. The subcommittee has no control over the funds for these programs. which are automatically spent. The remaining fundsabout 25 percent of the total money in this bill--are divided among the other labor. health. human services. and education programs that are so critical to us. especially now. The total fiscal year 1994 funding in this bill is $4.1 billion less than the President requested in his budget. The bill also meets its spending target. set by the Appropriations Committee. based on the fiscal year 1994 budget resolution. H.R. 2518 does not drive us deeper into debt. but helps us meet our goal of living within our means. Americas families. workers. children. and elderly need the programs and services that H.R. 2518 sustains and provides. It is obvious that. without this bill. we would not be able to fund the essential programs that support our basic needs. A vote for the health. education. nutrition. and employment programs in H.R. 2518 is a vote for us all.",

Navy officials chose this method. claiming that it. one. weighs all patrols equally regardless of length. two. provides a conservative figure\"Let me repeat that. \"Provides a conservative figure. and. three. has proven successful in estimating spares for prior programs such as the Trident I. The Navys guidance system operational readiness goal is to have adequate spares available 99.9 percent of the time.\" Now. that is the Navys goal. The Navy also included a 99 percent confidence level factor in its calculations because. according to Navy officials. it provided a more conservative result and helped ensure that sufficient spares would be available even in the event of unforeseen future systems problems. Based on this methodology. the Navy calculated that six spare guidance systems are required on each submarine. Madam President. the GAO did not fully accept all of the Navys assumptions because the Navy could not back up what they wanted with what their experience had been. There was nothing in the Navy criteria to justify six guidance systems per missile. But let me stress that. Under my amendment. in only 2 yearsand that is 24 years from nowin only 2 years. the year 2017 and 2018. will there be four MK6s on board each submarine instead of six.",

What I would like to suggest to my friend. as a way to bringing this to conclusion and perhaps agreementif not we come to a vote--that we fence $106 million and basically require the Secretary of Defense to examine the GAO report. examine the Navy response to that report. and he not expend that money unless he believes it is essential. after looking at those reports. to the national security.

That is that if you want to. you can save up to $318 million on guidance systems If you are willing to reduce the operational readiness on one missile on one submarine in that same 2year period to .31253. Then. there would be a chance that you might have a submarine someplace in the next 20 years that would have one missile out of its 24 that would not fire. But rather than try to save $318 million. I have tried to comply with precisely the recommendations of the GAO. cut it off at 0.7percent risk in one 2year period on one missile on one submarine. I do not mind telling you. I am astounded that we would spend money like that for that kind of builtin redundancy. I want to say to the Senator from Georgia that I respect his knowledge and I respect his integrity on these issues. All I want to say is that once we get the Navy response. he and I sit down and discuss it. just an honest discussion. and ask ourselves if this is a place we can and should save $106 million? Or should we blow $106 million just to satisfy ourselves on redundancy? The appropriations process is going to be coming along. We will have an opportunity then. In the Senators request of the Navy. I would like the Senator to attach some urgency to it. because you never know when that appropriations process will be finished. We have in the past. as the Senator knows. passed appropriations bills before an authorization bill came out. All I am saying is that I would like to put some urgency to the request to the Navy so we can get that information back here before the appropriations process. so if the Senator and I still have a basic disagreement. we can look at it then. I do not think we have a disagreement now. I think the Senator is simply saying I want to hear the Navys side on it before I make that decision.",

Because if you fence the money. that means they cannot spend it until the Secretary of Defense makes the certification. and he would have to have the response from the Navy there. So the Navy has every incentive to accelerate that response. If we go this way. I think you have that sense of urgency built into the approach. But I would also be j.lad to sit down with the Senator. and the Senator from South Carolina. and the Navy people involved. or the people from the Secretary of Defense involved. and try to understand this completely and make a decision on it while we are in conference.

    "speech": "Madam President. during the Senate Armed Services Committee consideration of the 1995 defense authorization bill. an amendment was offered requiring the Army to transfer between 84 and 124 MIAl tanks to the Marine Corps. The amendment would have also effectively stopped the modernization of the National Guard. as Congress had directed a few years ago. As cochairman of the National Guard Caucus I. and my fellow cochairman. Senator BOND from Missouri. believe this language should not be included as a part of this legislation because it violated the GoldwaterNickles Act. In addition. there is not a valid Joint Chiefs of Staff requirement for the transfer of these tanks from the Army to the Marine Corps. The amendment at the desk is a compromise reached with the help of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and its ranking member. The aniendment would place a cap of 84 MIA1 tanks to be given to the Marine Corps as they become excess to the active duty Army. The amendment would also direct the Secretary of the Army to transfer an MiAl tank on a oneforone basis to the Marine Corps and to the National Guard. Furthermore. Madam President. it directs that this transfer of tanks to the Marine Corps will be made at no expense to the Army. The amendment would require the transfer of plain MIA1 tanks from active Army. not MIA1 common tanks. This will assure that these MiA1 tanks would not have to be taken from active duty Army units. And so. Madam President. I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of my remarks be included in the RECORD.",

And while we are starting to see the positive effects of these choices in the cities and towns in my district. the scars of the recent recession are still fresh there as well. Now is the time to redouble our efforts to ensure that all of our citizens gain from the recent recovery. including the people in the inner cities who suffered so greatly under the policies of the 1980s. The CBC budget recognizes the magnitude of the need for Investment in our communities. It Increases funding for community and regional development by about $530 million over the Presidents request. It provides Increased funds for the Community Development Block Grant Program. And It adds $750 million for the Neighborhood Infrastructure Improvement and Inner City Jobs Creation Act. which funds job creation for people In poor communities who are out of work or lack basic skills.

The passage of a budget resolution represents the best efforts of the Nations elected leaders to reach some consensus on National priorities for the coming fiscal year. The priorities reflected In the CBC alternative focus on meeting the needs of our most vulnerable citizens. while investing In the Nations technology and infrastructure. While the economy Is strengthening. and consumer and business confidence Increase. we cannot lose sight of those Americans who continue to be left behindfamilies and individuals who have little confidence in the future. and little reason to believe. that. as the economy strengthens. they will somehow share the benefits. The Congressional Black Caucus budget recognizes that Federal programs intended to improve the lives and living conditions of Americans. and enhance opportunities for all citizens to share in economic revival. are vital investments in the future of the Nation. If this country does not act to stem poverty. unemployment. illiteracy. and homelessness. or address the lack of affordable health care. we will face a larger price tag to alleviate them in the future. The Increases in the CBC budget in education acknowledge the severe situation facing our Nations schools. and the need for additional Federal involvement to improve the quality of elementary and secondary school facilities. The $530 million increase In community and regional development represents a recognition of the dire circumstances of the Nations urban and rural communities. Notwithstanding my support for the priorities incorporated in the CBC budget document. I do have reservations about the size of defense reductions contained in the proposal. There have been enormous changes around the globe in recent years. The reevaluation of our strategic interests and defense needs continue. We must continue to scrutinize how best to use our limited resources to meet our future defense needs. but we must also take care to ensure our military readiness in the face of continued uncertainty around the world. In the coming year. the House will have the opportunity to debate many of the goals prioritized in the CBC budget alternative. as we consider reforms in health care. welfare. employment and training programs. and proposals to curb violent crime. I strongly endorse the Mfume budget amendment as a valuable instrument in illustrating how these objectives can be accomplished.",

This alternative is about investing In people and our future.

It cuts Medicare. it cuts biomedical research. it cuts immunizations. it cuts substance abuse treatment. it cuts womens health initiatives. The substitute is designed. I want the Members to understand. to embarrass the President of the United States by enacting in this budget the Michel alternative to the health care proposal that the President has submitted to us. It would do that by putting in this bill the socalled Michel substitute. even though the bill has never been referred to the Committee on the Budget and has not yet been reported out of the committees that have jurisdiction. However. this substitute does more than try to trick us into a health care proposal that does not provide universal coverage. The substitute would shift an additional $30 billion in outofpocket costs onto Medicare beneficiaries over the next 5 years. It would cut Medicare payments to teaching hospitals by $13.5 billion over the next 5 years. The Kasich substitute would propose almost $30 billion in new outofpocket costs on Medicare beneficiaries. and would do this by imposing coinsurance requirements for home health care and clinical lab services. It is true that some of the proposals in Medicare cuts are also in the Presidents bill. but look at the context. The Presidents bill would use some of those savings for pharmaceutical drug coverage for the elderly. for some home health care services for them as well. That is what they would get in exchange for these proposals under the Presidents health care reform. but in exchange for these higher costsharing requirements. what do Medicare beneficiaries get under the Kasich substitute? Nothing. except for higher outofpocket costs if they do get sick and happen to need home health care or laboratory services. Finally. Mr. Chairman. the Kasich substitute would reduce the Medicare indirect teaching adjustments from 7.7 to 3 percent. taking $13.5 billion away from teaching hospitals bearing the responsibility for caring for the uninsured. Make no mistake. Mr. Chairman. a vote for this substitute is a vote against the President. a vote against the elderly. a vote against teaching hospitals. and a vote against universal coverage for health care for our people.

It supports economic growth. it cuts the deficit $150 billion more than President Clintons and provides real tax relief for the American family. During the last 40 years. the Federal income tax burden for a family of four has increased by 250 percent as a share of family income. Today. most American families pay more in Federal taxes than they pay for food. clothing. transportation. insurance and recreation combined. Thats tragic. A recent poll reveals Americans favor family tax relief 3 to 1. even if it means cuts in entitlements. The Kasich budget provides a $500 per child family tax creditfor three children that would be $1.500 more in purchasing power. Ninety percent of this relief goes to families making loss than $75.000 a year. The family is the first and best Department of Education. The first and best Department of Health and Human Services. The first and best Department of Housing: And the first and best Department of Energy and Transportation. There is no instrument of economic growth. savings. and job training as effective as the middle class family. It is the repository of values. It is the sustainer of society. And our Government has chiseled away at its foundation for 40 years. The question that confronts us is this: Is our faith in the big brother of big Government. or Is our faith in the moms and dads of America? The mantra of the Beltway is: The Government giveth and the Government taketh away. Blessed be the hand of big Government. The Kasich budget says. \"No more.\" It strikes a blow for the most neglected special interest in Americathe family. For once. let us forgot party loyalty and party discipline. For once. let us forget the marching orders and let us do right for the family. Let us return over $20 billion per year to the families of 50 million American children.",

What we must remember is what they are doing to the budget. The socalled appeal to family is entirely decimated in the Republican alternative.

I voted to repeal it last year on a similar bill. even though it raised spending. but not to the unacceptable level this bill does. I supported President Clintons repeal by Executive order. I am growing increasingly angry at the arrogance of the big spenders who attach huge Increases In funding to important legislation.

The program also provides Information. education. training. and research in family planning. The Title X Program annually prevents an estimated 1.2 million unintended pregnancies and thereby prevents more than half a million abortions. The statute has long providedand continues to providethat no Federal funding may be used to fund abortion as a method of family planning. Though one mission and accomplishment of the program has been the prevention of abortion. political interference has distracted those operating the program from doing their job as well as they might. Moreover the Congress has become distracted from helping promote the good work that title X accomplishes and has not reauthorIzed it in several years. As the author of the prohibition on the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion as a method of birth control. I continue to believe in this policy. I also believe In the importance of this program. I have reviewed the alleged evidence that the program promotes abortions and found it wanting. Instead. I find a program which Is accomplishingadmittedly against tall oddsits original mission of providing family planning services to American families. In keeping with the mission of the program. this reauthorization increases funding for vital programs while continuing to keep the Federal Government out of the business of abortion. The legislation does not change the provision codified in section 1008 against use of Federal funds to pay for abortion as a method of birth control. With respect to parental notification for abortion conducted on minors. the bill essentially defers to State law by requiring clinics to certify compliance with such laws. Finally. the bill codifies the reversal of the gag rule.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. it is outrageous In this age of deficit reduction. that title X funding is slated to receive a 56 percent increase over last year. And the Irony is that not one study has demonstrated that prior funding has been effective in reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies. Additionally. there has been a decline in the number of lowincome women at risk of unintended pregnancy. Not only is this bill fiscally questionable. but by mandating abortion referral and counseling. It further distorts the original Intent of title X fundingfamily planning. In a recent poll. 88 percent of Americans support restrictions on access to abortion including parental notification. Ignoring the sentiments of the vast majority of Americans Instead. this bill forces title X recipients to offer referrals for abortions at the patients request. Even those caregivers with moral objections to abortion services are forced to refer patients to an organization to discuss pregnancy termination. In many states. even minors must be referred to an abortion provider upon request without any parental notification. Title X money is intended for family planning. I submit that abortion is not a method of family planning. This money could be used for education and other pregnancy prevention measures. However. It Is serving only to perpetuate the profit making abortion Industry. Title X funding does this by cutting the overhead costs of the \"for profit\" abortion industry by allowing the money to be directed toward administrative costs of operating these facilities. Planned Parenthood. Americas leading abortion provider and the largest recipient of title X funding. facilitates 32 abortions for each patient that receives prenatal care. Wheres the parenthood in planned parenthood? I respectfully encourage my colleagues to oppose this bill on the grounds that it Is fiscally irresponsible. it Ignores parental notification responsibilities. and it further deviates from the original intent of title X funding.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. though I support parental notification for abortion procedures. I cannot support the Bliley amendment to the reauthorization of title X family planning for three reasons. The Bliley language limits waiver of parental notification to cases of incest. abuse. or neglect by a parent or legal guardian. This is a reasonable waiver but does not go far enough. My own State of Illinois revised its definition of the crime of Incest in 1984 to include sexual attacks not only by parents but also attacks by close relatives of the victim as well as persons residing in the household with the child continuously for at least 1 year. This definition is more realistic and sensitive to the realities facing many families. The Bliley language does not take these realities into consideration. Second. Mr. BLILEY allows an exception for parental notification only for the crime of incest. Illinois and at least five other States. Maryland. Michigan. New Jersey. Ohio. and Vermont. have replaced the crime of incest with new crimes such as sexual relations within families. Mr. BLILEYS language neither acknowledges these changes in State criminal practice nor provides for any way to make his approach to parental notification compatible with these new laws. Finally. there is a carefully crafted provision in the Bliley language which allows for Slate preemption of the Federal parental notification provision. The wording of this language narrowly defines the State parental notification laws which would preempt the Federal standard. In fact. the definition is so narrow as to disqualify the parental notification laws in 21 States for purposes of preempting the Bliley Federal standard. The language already included in the bill requires title X family planning clinics to certify compliance with State parental notification laws in force and is a better alternative to the Bliley language.",

It is appropriate for States to address it because there are complicated matters to be adjusted between privacy rights. parental rights. public health. and appropriate medical care.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to correct an inequity lacing the disabled. I am referring to the 10percent luxury tax imposed on all vehicles costing over $30.000. In 1991. I was contacted by a constituent who was very concerned that the luxury tax on automobiles would inadvertently penalize the disabled. According to Independent Mobility Systems. Inc. of Farmington. NM. a company specializing in the conversion of minivans for use by the disabled. it often takes expensive modifications and thousands of manhours to meet the special needs of disabled drivers. The cost of adding wheelchair lifts. specialized steering units and mirrors. lowering floors. and modifying doors can easily raise the cost of a vehicle over the $30.000 luxury tax threshold. I am sure my colleagues will agree that these vehicles are necessities to the hundreds of thousands of disabled Americans who use them to get to work. go to the doctor. and to travel freely. They are not luxuries and should not be taxed as such At the present time. exemptions are provided for vehicles used for business purposes. but no exemption exists for handicapped specialized vehicles. The 102d Congress came close to passing legislation to provide an exemption for these vehicles. Unfortunately. that measure did not become public law. My legislation is identical to the measure that was included in last years tax bill. This years bill. which I introduce today with Congressman STEVEN SCHIFF of New Mexico. will provide an exemption from the luxury tax for modifications. parts. and accessories installed on a vehicle to enable or assist the disabled to operate the vehicle. or compensate for the effects of their disability. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to repeal this unjust tax.",

I join my colleagues in the House in support of Congressman JOE KENNEDYs House Concurrent Resolution 61 that calls on the British Government to initiate a bill of rights for Northern Ireland. As St. Patrick is heralded for ridding Ireland of its snakes. it Is my sincerest hope that this legislation will begin the process of reform so that Northern Ireland shall be rid of human rights inequalities as well. This resolution seeks the British Governments support for a fundamental bill of rights for all the citizens of Northern Ireland. This will be the surest and most effective means of ensuring that all citizens. both Catholics and Protestants. can depend on the tenets inscribed in the European Communitys Convention on Human Rights. The absence of such a measure will ensure the continuation of the historical human rights disparities that the citizens of Northern Ireland have endured. For the United States and the United Kingdom. as nations that hold sacred the rule of law. it would be hypocritical not to suggest equality for all those who live within our countries. The onus Is on the British Government to create a bill of rights that would establish a trial by jury. the right to remain silent. and the right to assembly for all the citizens of Northem Ireland. These provisions have been in suspension under the current \"emergency\" rule established by the British Government. The bill of rights proposal has the backing of every major constituent party in Northern Ireland. I urge the British Government to act quickly in its establishment. With that.

Mr. Speaker. the freedom we take for granted in the United States is unknown to Northem Ireland. The people of Northern Ireland have endured human rights violations for far too long. They need and deserve the protection which a Bill of Rights provides. Under this resolution. our Government would petition the British Government to guarantee the citizens of Northern Ireland their fundamental rights such as trial by jury. the right to remain silent and the right to freedom of assembly. Passage of this resolution will demonstrate the strong support which Americans have for the basic human rights of all people in Northern Ireland. Protecting human rights and working to end antiCatholic discrimination in Northern Ireland are legitimate concerns for our Government. That is why I have cosponsored this resolution introduced by Congressman KENNEDY and that is why I also support the MacBride principles and the appointment of a special United States envoy to Northern Ireland. By passing the McBride principles. Congress would go a long way to help end discriminatory practices by United States companies against Catholic workers in Northern Ireland. As outlined In H.R. 672. adoption of the MacBride principles would prevent United States companies in Northern Ireland from exporting products into the United States unless they are in compliance with fair employment practices. By appointing a special envoy. President Clinton would give new urgency to the search for peace among the Irish and British Governments and all the major parties In Northern Ireland.

Green Island. and the town and village of Waterford. They are located on the Hudson River. and formed one of the earliest centers of the Industrial Revolution. Iron and textiles were the major industries in this area blessed with resources. hydropower. and transportation access. Today visitors can see the restored Harmony Mills building with its two massive turbines. worker housing. Waterford Lock 2 on the Erie Canal. the Watervliet Arsenal. in operation since 1813. and other attractions and museums. In 1991. Congressman McNULTY from the Albany district and I introduced legislation that authorized a study by the Department of the Interior of nationally significant places in American labor history. It became Public Law 102101. When complete. the study will show us which sites deserve designation as national historic or heritage landmarks. As a result of the study two sites in RiverSpark are to be nominated as national heritage landmarks: Harmony Mills and the home of Kate Mullaney. who founded the first womens union in the countryof collar and laundry workers. The next step in RiverSpark is the development of these and other sites. the development of educational programs and materials. and planning how to spread the word about this wonderful urban park and attract visitors. I am asked to help provide $75.000 for this purpose. Mr. President. I understand that there is no room left in the Senate bill to provide funds for RiverSpark. but I wonder if when the chairman goes to conference he might consider funds from the statutory aid account or another source that might become available in the course of his deliberations. The area is truly a national resource for those who want to learn about the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the labor movement.",

I am particularly appreciative that some very important land acquisition projects have been funded in the bill. There is one project. however. that came up very recently. in fact. too late to be considered by the committee. The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument is located in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. This monument was established as a living laboratory for people to monitor the recovery of nature following a catastrophic volcanic eruption. There is but one inholding remaining within the monument. The owners of this land. located near the Toutle River on the monuments west side. have secured logging permits to harvest its timber. At the last minute. the Forest Service and some local conservationists have approached the owners about the possibility of selling the land. The owners have expressed interest. In fact. a tentative purchase agreement is in place. It is possible this acquisition could be undertaken for a relatively modest sum. While it has not been addressed in either the House or Senate bills. I am interested in working with the chairman and the other conferees to see if we can include language in the statement of managers encouraging the Forest Service to use its emergencies and inholdings account to address this issue.

The President proposed an increase of $288 million in fiscal year 1995 to implement the Energy Policy Act of 1992. various important energy initiatives. a variety of successful programs. and the voluntary measures under the climate change action plan. The House provided an increase of $134 million for these accounts. but the Senate committee was only able to provide an increase of $53 million in this important area. In the area of the State energy programs alone. including the State Energy Conservation Program. the Institutional Conservation Program. and the Low Income Weatherization Program. the Senate bill would provide $264.4 million. In fiscal year 1979 these same programs received $558 million. so that if inflation were taken into account. the funding level would be over $1 billion today. In light of the important national goals these programs promote. especially the State Energy Conservation Program. the Institutional Conservation Program. the Rebuild American Program. the Home Energy Ratings and Energy Efficient Mortgage Program. the alternative fuels promotion activity. section 409 of the Energy Policy Act. the Weatherization Program and the socalled nice three program. these programs are worthy of support and the Housepassed levels are preferable.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the United States of America uses more energy than any other country in the world. We are the sixth most intensive energy user on a per capita basis. This means that the United States has to deal with serious environmental problems. national security problems. social problems. and economic competitiveness problems associated with energy costs. The amendment in committee that cuts $11 million from the Department of Energy cuts into a chance to turn some of these problems around. One promising opportunity is the integrated resource planning [IRP] program which helps States implement costeffective conservation measures to reduce demand and enhance energy supply. According to the World Resources Institutes Environmental Almanac. Vermont earned an IRP grade of \"A\" in a national ranking. However. Vermont still spends $800 million a year for imported energy despite these good efforts. I have to assume that there are many other States that lose much more than $800 million annually from their local economies. and could put this problem to excellent use. The weatherization program in the DOE budget helps lowincome families stay warm in the winternot just by paying fuel bills. but by helping them to save energy. Rebuild America. another example of a promising conservation program. is an umbrella program in the buildings program area that enhances commercial and communitylevel energy efficiency through local partnerships. The State Energy Conservation Program helps businesses and industry become more competitive by reducing energy consumption and associated costs. The Energy Efficient Mortgage Program in this bill helps Americans qualify for larger home mortgages if they buy an energy efficient home. Vermont has been using this program since the early 1980s. and it is time to get more States involved. By way of example. a family in Burlington. VT was able to get a larger mortgage. decrease their monthly energy costs. and save almost $100 a month. This makes economic. social. and environmental sense. I could list many other programs affected by the $11 million cut in committee. I could also mention some of the 938 organizations nationwide who have written to the President in support of these programs. At this point. however. I simply urge my colleagues to find out how these programs help their States and then support an increase in conference. I hope that in conference we can restore the energy conservation money. and hopefully settle close to the House mark.",

In Americas workplace. we have an expectation that fairness and due care will be taken in situations where a persons livelihood may be threatened based on allegations of misconduct or poor performance. For civilian technicians in our National Guard. the original 1968 Technicians Act recognized that these workers. like competitive service employees. should be protected from termination based on erroneous accusations. But that act unfortunately stopped short of providing the technicians the same procedural remedies which protect all other competitive service employees from arbitrary and even capricious terminations. Mr. Chairman. this amendment finally corrects that oversight by providing those procedural protections to civilian technicians. It includes the requirement that cause be proven by the employer at a posttermination evidentiary hearing before a neutral hearing officer who has been trained in the proper conduct of such procedures and who has the authority to award reinstatement if injustice has occurred. This amendment relieves the State Adjutants General of the burden of final responsibility for procedural fairness in terminations. It assures those Adjutants General who make prompt decisions based on available information that. after any termination. a professional hearing examiner will be available to conduct a thorough inquiry and ensure that the government has not erred and. in so doing. lost a valuable employee. I say to my colleagues this is a fair and practical measure that deserves our support.

This amendment is about Justice. It is about equality. It is about treating people fairly. There are three branches of our military who have civilian technician brograms--the Army Reserve. the Air Force Reserve and the National Guard. National Guard technicians do not have the same rights as those in the Army Reserve. Or those in the Air Force Reserve. You see. they do not have the same right to appeal their punishment. They must buy this rightwith time. with money. with great effort. The BoniorGingrich amendment gives National Guard technicians the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. a neutral Federal agency. Technicians in the Reserves already have this right. My colleagues. it is time to ensure that National Guard technicians receive justice. That they are not denied equality. The BoniorGingrich amendment will help ensure that all civilian technicians have these fundamental rights. I urge you to vote for the BoniorGingrich amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan. I am very concerned that the amendment completely overlooks the fact that military technicians have always been employees of the State. They are administered. hired. and fired by purely State officals--the State Adjutants General. They carry out functions constitutionally reserved to the States. Technicians were made nominal Federal employees by the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 for the purpose of improving their pay and benefits by making them eligible for Federal pay scales and retirement and other benefits. The decision to make them nominal Federal employees was a device designed to skirt the constitutional issues that require the State to control all aspects of technician employment. The 1968 Technicians Act very specifically commented on the compromise nature of the law because it was quite clear to those who crafted the act that the States could not be denied the authority to employ and administer technicians. If this amendment becomes law. the State Governors wt Id suddenly find themselves having t. respond to binding orders from a Federal administrative body dealing with issues that are explicitly reserved to the States by the Constitution. This is surely a burden that this body would reluctantly place on the Governors of this Nation. Mr. Chairman. I would hope that any injustice that may exist in the system could be dealt with without challenging the Governors in this manner. I for one would welcome the opportunity to examine this issue more closely to determine the nature and scope of the problem. At this moment. I ask my colleagues to vote no on the Bonior amendment.",

Phillip Stollman. one of the founders of the university. will be entering his 90th year. This will be a time of great celebration. as the Detroit Friends of Barflan University gather to honor this exceptional man. Phil Stollman was approached in 1950 to discuss the establishment of a university in Israel that would combine religious studies with secular education. where science and religion would be taught together. By 1952. enough funds had been raised privately to begin construction. and in 1954 the university opened with 70 students. This was a remarkable achievement involving the participation of the entire Stollman family. Phil dreamed of a student enrollment that would eventually reach 1.000. today 17.000 students participate in all levels of study and research at BarDan. It is not difficult to praise this manbut it is difficult to get him to accept this praise. He is a modest person who has quietly. but effectively. worked in countless charitable and communal organizations in Detroit. throughout the United States. and indeed. around the world. Phils closest friends and partners in all endeavors were his late brother and his sisterinlaw. Max and Frieda Stollman. All three received honorary doctorates from BarIlan. and Phil was the longtime chairman of Barflans Global Board of Trustees and is now its honorary chairman for life. In Detroit. the names Stollman and BarIlan University are synonymous. Mr. President. I wish to congratulate Phil Stollman and simply note that the greatest tribute to the fulfillment of his dreams is the continuation of involvement with BarIlan University by a second generation of Stollmans.",

It is really a concession when he says where there is a fraudulent concealment. there must be a remedy. That is my point. Where there is fraudulent concealment. there must be a remedy. When the Senator from Ohio suggests a remedy in a suit against someone in the military or a civilian. that does not remedy the problem of the closure of the Philadelphia Navy Yard. I am not unaware of how to proceed on a criminal complaint for fraud. I know how to do that. But if I put someone in jail for fraud. which I have done. it is not a remedy for the Philadelphia Navy Yard. It is not a remedy for the importance of the yard to national defense or a remedy for the thousands of people who are thrown out of work. Now. when the Senator from Ohio asks me have I asked the inspector general to look into it. I have asked everybody in the chain of.command up to the Secretary of Defense. and that is Secretary of Defense Perry and that is Secretary of Defense Cheney. and the Secretaries of the Navy. The inspector general specifically has not been asked. but I have the question pending before the Secretary of Defense. But the inspector general lives in America. He knows of the controversy concerning the closure of the Philadelphia Navy Yard. There is hardly anybody who does not. And I asked the Secretary of Defense most recently in a letter which I sent to him on May 24. 1994. which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the RECORD so I do not have to read the whole letter.",

But back to the first point the Senator from Ohio made when he asked me to yieldand I was glad to do that. I think it is good to do it because we get to the basic point.

The substance of it is straightforward: it makes it very clear that we in the Senate do not view ourselves as obliged in any way in favor of the use of force by the recent U.N. action. While the substance of this amendment is not controversial. the concerns behind it are of great import. This Senate has already gone on record that we expect to be consulted before any use of force is authorized in Iaiti. The recent action in the United Nations has prompted a great deal of speculation nonetheless that such an invasion is imminent. and that somehow the United States has signed off on this as the most appropriate course. I trust that this action today will make it abundantly clear to all observers that the United States has not approved any such action until the U.S. Senate has been consulted and approved itexcepting of course the latitude granted to the President at all times to act in the interest of our national security. So I am pleased that it appears that we will approve this measure. We should not have continued idle speculation that Congress will tacitly accept a military action in Haiti.

We have to fight this amendment now. not only because it deals with ethanol and is bad for ethanol. but it is bad for agriculture. as the authors own statements indicate. The oil industry does not like competition. Let us get that straight. The oil industry does not like competition. The oil industry battles anything remotely viewed as competition to its monopoly over United States fuel supply. Big oil does like mandates. They may not like an ethanol mandate. but they like mandates. They like it if it is an oil mandate. When convenient and serving the interests of the oil industry. that industry demands that the Federal Government impose market mandates and protectionist policies to protect it from competition.

And. again. if I can prove this. which I believe I can. to the Senator from Louisiana. perhaps he would want to withdraw his amendment. because he is basing so much of it on the fact that it takes more energy to make ethanol than the energy we get out of it.

Our initiative is based upon a special resource study completed by the National Park Service last fall which found that the New Bedford area meets the criteria for inclusion in the National Park System. The city of New Bedford. tucked by the sea in the southeast corner of Massachusetts has a rich and diverse history. For decades it was the center of our Nations whaling industry. Although the whaling industry collapsed by the turn of the last century. New Bedford is to this day remembered for its seafaring heritage. As a national park. the New Bedford National Historic Landmark District and surrounding area would enhance the National Park System by expanding its maritime history theme to include a focus on our Nations whaling past. Particularly noteworthy are the historic town center. the waterfront with the national historic landmark schooner Ernestina and an array of over three dozen historically rehabilitated buildings which combine to provide a cultural resource that reflects the era of whaling. Since 1962. a public/private partnershipinitiated by the Waterfront Historic Area League of New Bedford in cooperation with the Bedford Landing Taxpayers Association. the Old Dartmouth Historical Society. private property owners. and the city of New Bedfordhas raised $3.7 million in public funding and $2.7 million in private investment. rehabilitated 36 buildings. and created over 40 new businesses and 200 new jobs. Creating a New Bedford Whaling Park will preserve an important piece of seafarer heritage while simultaneously permitting the public/ private partnership to expand and grow. I am hopeful that the Senate will look favorably upon this initiative and I encourage my colleagues to support this important addition to our National Park System.",

I also commend Chairman FORD and Chairman KILDEE for their work in advancing H.R. 1804 through Congress. I support H.R. 1804 because It makes school reform a national priority. H.R. 1804 authorizes funds for States and local school districts to create or continue systemic education reforms. The purposes of Goals 2000 are clearto fundamentally improve teaching and learning in our public schools. H.R. 1804 would codify the National Education Goals which were adopted 4 years ago by the countrys Governors. It would Increase our expectations of students and teachers alike. Goals 2000 woeld establish high standards for students. equip teachers with new training opportunities. and make schools safe and drug free. A significant feature of Goals 2000 is that it recognizes the need for and the benefit of a bottomup approach to reform. National education reform of this magnitude must Include the experiences. the input. and the participation of parents. localities. and States. Many school districts and States have already begun to reform their education systems. Goals 2000 makes the Federal Government a partner with parents. communities. and individual schools In that elfort. The objectives of H.R. 1804 are ambitious and important: By the year 2000. the high school graduation rate should Increase to at least 90 percent. American students should be the first in the worid in science and math. and every American adult should enjoy functional literacy. I agree with the administration that we must set these goals and we must back up these goals with the support necessary to realize them. These objectives are achievable with the cooperation of communities. businesses. and governments at the local. State. and national levels. I am pleased to serve on the LaborHealth and Human ServicesEducation Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee which will fund these Important Initiatives. Madam Chairman. I urge my colleagues to join me today in support of H.R. 1804 and In support of improving the education of our Nations children.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. in preparing for the debate on education reform. I wanted to hear from the people on the front lines of education. In August. I sent out a questionnaire to teachers and other educational professionals in my district. I received 760 responses to the questionnaire which asked about both the Goals 2000 legislation and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The results of the questionnaire will be helpful to Members of Congress as we consider the future of education in this country. I would like to submit the results into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and quickly share some of the highlights with my colleagues. The overriding theme of the responses was that education professionals are committed to education reform. They clearly want to be part of the solution. not part of the problem. It is obvious to me that the people involved in education in the Milwaukee area care deeply about children and the future of American education. Regarding the Goals 2000 legislation. 80 percent of those surveyed believe the Federal Government should adopt national education goals. Sixtytwo percent agreed with the premise behind the Goals 2000 legislation that by developing more challenging expectations. we will see an overall increase in student achievement. Sixtyeight percent said they would be willing or very willing to promote and support Goals 2000 and related programs. Less than 1 percent said they were opposed or strongly opposed to promoting and supporting the programs. Many respondents stressed the need for greater parental involvement in eduration and expressed their hope that more people would support. value. and respect teachers. The results of my education questionnaire show that we have a real opportunity to work with education professionals to enact education reforms. I hope that my colleagues will be listening to the concerns of educators so that we can create the best educational system in the world.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I rise in opposition to H.R. 1804. the Goals 2000: Educate America Act. While there is need for improvement of the education system in America. I deeply resent yet another attempt by the Federal Government to dictate to parents and local school boards the methods for that reform. Despite the thoughts of the socalled experts residing within the beltway. I maintain that no one is better qualified to decide how best to educate a child than a parent. The proponents of Goals 2000 emphasize debunked arguments which mandate spending as a panacea for both poor test performance among students as well as for all other education woes. I submit that before true education reform takes place. parents. not politicians must provide the impetus for that reform. As Introduced. H.R. 1804 will not allow parents to make the key decisions which affect their childrens education. Standards by which children will be measured are determined at the national level and while compliance with these standards is voluntary. compliance is mandatory to open the spigot. allowing the flood of Federal funds to flow to the local districts. Furthermore. although this legislation does allow for a diluted form of school choice. the program expressly prohibits Federal funds to be used for private. home. and Christian schools. In practice. Goals 2000 has the potential to become a vehicle by which liberals will impose their enlightened wisdom upon impressionable youth. Out of this wisdom comes inept programs such as outcomebased education where children are forced into the Indoctrination of politically correct ideas and where the students beliefs and behavior are considered superior to their knowledge of facts. In addition. while school boards are indispensable at the local level. a national school board. as called for in H.R. 1804. adds nothing but another layer of bureaucracy to the already overburdened American school system. Madam Chairman. our constituents sent us to Washington to protect their interests. Unless we allow the parents to make the critical decisions in education reform. we are violating that trust. We do not need more Federal involvement in education. We need local/parental control and school choice if we are to improve the education our children receive. For this reason. I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 1804.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I am a father of two children. one in the second grade and another about to begin school. so I am deeply concerned about this bill. I strongly support the Armey substitute because it gives choice to parents. not a National School Board in Washington. As contained in H.R. 1804. the National School Board will have 20 members. all handpicked by the very education establishment that is failing our children. The Armey substitute would place decisionmaking at the State and local level. The Armey substitute builds on 4 years worth of bipartisan teamwork between the National Governors Association developing a plan that focuses on student achievement. not Federal Intrusion at the State level. This bill. unlike the Armey substitute. imposes more Washingtondriven redtape. requirements. rules. and regulations on our States. communities. and classrooms. This bill guarantees that those who have a say in education reform will be the bureaucrats in Washington. not the parents and teachers in the cities and towns of America. It opts for topdown reform from Washington. not bottomup reforms led by parents and tailored to local needs. The Armey substitute allows localities to define \"choice\" for themselves. They can include nonpublic schools in their programs if they want. but they are not required to do so. This substitute will give parents more choice of schools for their children. I believe my wife and I know what Is best for our two children and Americas parents know what is best for theirs. Goals 2000 mistakenly assumes that Federal school bureaucrats know better how to educate my children. I dont want to leave Alicia and Austins future in bureaucrats hands.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment to H.R. 1804 being offered by my colleague from Illinois. This amendment would prevent any school district with more than 250.000 students from receiving any State grant funds for school reform. As a result. four of the most beleaguered school districts in the country. Chicago. New York City. Los Angeles and Miami. would ail be denied any of the important grant funds in H.R. 1804. Not only is this amendment insensitive and meanspirited but it would be genuinely detrimental to many of my constituents who attend Chicago public schools. The problems of the Chicago public schools are well known and daunting. After a frustrating delay. the Chicago public schools have again had to start out their school year facing enormous obstacles and insufficient funds to meet the needs of its students. Because more than 80 percent of Chicago public school students are eligible for the lunch program. the school system is plagued by problems of poverty. Not only are funds desperately needed to recruit and retain teachers. increase school safety and anticrime efforts. reduce class sizes. and meet the needs of the thousands of students who are not English proficient but funding is also needed to rebuild or renovate the hundreds of Chicago school facilities that are in shameful states of disrepair. In fact. 15percent of Chicagos public schools were built before the turn of the century and more than half were built before World War II. Despite these extraordinary obstacles. Chicago has been a leader In school reform efforts. In 1989. the central school board was virtually eliminated. empowering teachers. parents. and principals to manage individual schools. The Consortium on Chicago School Research estimates that from 36 to 45 percent of the newly selfgoverning elementary schools have taken on systemic restructuring. Such schools are considered more than twice as likely to exhibit studentcentered learning practices which Is critical to improving our students education and meeting the goals Included In Goals 2000. To target Chicago. or any other city. and prevent its schools from continuing their reform efforts with the assistance of State grant funds simply because of its size is blatantly unfair and unjustified. On behalf of the millions of students who would suffer from this amendment. I urge my colleagues to join me and oppose it.",

Many of my colleagues in the House know of my commitment to education reform efforts that ensure every child in America will have access to a high quality education. Because of this. it Is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to endorse the Goals 2000Educate America project. Madam Chairman. it was only a short time ago that arts curriculums In our Nations schools were considered extracurricular activities. Fortunately. however. due to the vision of Education Secretary Richard Riley. a new philosophy has emerged from the administration and is encompassed in the Goals 2000 Program. The voluntary standards set forth In this program assures that every child. In every school district. in every State across America. will have the opportunity to develop their minds through exposure to music and the other arts. In Tennessee alone. education reform initiatives will lead to a hiring of over 200 music. art. and physical education teachers in Tennessee for the current school year and will eventually lower the teacher/student ratio from the current level of 1 to 1.175 to 1 to 525 when the reform package is fully implemented. Congress should pass this plan and dedicate itself to the continued effort to see that these voluntary national standards are implemented in all of the 16.000 school districts across our Nation. Goals 2000 encourages us to be equal partners in the education reform effort and prove once and for all that we want to invest in our childrens education. Madam Chairman. Goals 2000 is a welcome change in philosophy and I am pleased that the current administration has chosen to acknowledge the critical importance of the arts in education reform.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I rise today in strong support for Goals 2000: Educate America Act. I commend Chairman FORD and Subcommittee Chair KILOEE for their work on this legislation and their collaboration with the administration. I supported the national education goals agreed upon by former President Bush and the Nations Governors. including thenGovernor Clinton of Arkansas back In 1990. The House of Representatives passed similar legislation last year which was later subject to a filibuster in the other body. This new bill represents a departure from traditional Federal assistance to State and local education reform. This bill will serve as a catalyst to systemic reform. Rather than targeting specific programs. this bill allows for coordinated reform in all parts of the education system. Rather than targeting special groups of children. this bill seeks broad based improvement for all children. Additionally. this legislation emphasizes three vital elements of reform: flexibility. creativity. and results. Our schools have been lacking these for far too long. This bills focus on academic results demonstrates a national commitment to our childrens development. To that end. this legislation encourages Increased parental involvement in educational Improvement. Traditionally the Federal Government has served to provide funding for programs carried out at State and local levels. I firmly believe In the right of parents and local communities to exercise responsibility for their childrens education. This bill does not take that responsibility away. I think it has become all too clear that our Nations education system Is in need of reform and new direction. It Is time this country examine its future and it is within our education system that our future lies. It is time for us to decide how our children should be prepared. what skills they will need. and how to accomplish that learning. We must teach our children well. we must invigorate their learning process. we must encourage them to pursue learning at all levels. And Importantly we must provide them with the necessary knowledge and skills to enter the work force as competent and productive workers. I believe these goals are well within our grasp. This Nation cannot accept the academic decline of its children. The time has come to welcome the challenges set forth In these goals. I urge my colleagues to support Goals 2000.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to engage the managers of the bill in a colloquy regarding the Department of Defenses high performance computer modernization program. and the high performance computer and communication program. I am specifically concerned about four provisions which were included in H.R. 2401. the Housepassed version of the National Defense Authorization Act. First. section 214 of title II of the Housereported bill contains language that is not competitive and virtually shuts out some important nonincumbent supercomputing vendors who could provide the Pentagon with new and possibly better technologies. Specifically. this section of the House bill gives the Department of Defense discretion to upgrade or actually replace obsolete computer facilities with new products from the same incumbent vendors without a new and competitive procurement. This discourages DOD from seeking the best products in the supercomputing arena as well as fair and open competition. Second. this same section of the Housereported bill further precludes the Department of Defense from considering high performance computing alternatives that are not substantially compatible with existing systems. This is inconsistent with recommendations made in the Departments high performance computer modernization plan of March 31. 1992. This language micromanages the Departments ability to modernize its supercomputer assets and shuts out a whole class of computer systems that the Pentagon may determine better meets its needs. Third. the House Armed Services Committee report contains language that recommends the fencing of 50 percent of all high performance computing and communications funds in the bill until the Secretary of Defense submits a plan to respond to the General Accounting Office report that criticizes the program. In my view. this restriction is unwarranted because most of the findings contained In the GAO report have been addressed by DOD and are being corrected. Finally. I would strongly recommend that a study of the Interagency high performance computing and communications initiative by the National Academy of Sciences. mandated by section 215 of the House bill. be opened to allow for input from the high performance computing industry.",

Of all the qualities that President Reagan listed. I think MALCOLM would say that the most important is loyalty to Wyoming. And whether it was protecting Wyoming jobs and Wyoming interests as ranking Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. standing up for small businesses and family farms. or helping to lead the Sagebrush Rebellion. MALCOLM WALLOP never forgot the priorities of the men and women who sent him here. He also never forgot that one of the most important duties of government is to protect its citizens. And throughout his three terms. there have been few Senators who have worked harder to strengthen our national security. I believe that Americas victory in the cold war was a direct result of the visionary leadership of Ronald Reagan. George Bush. and public servants like MALCOLM WALLOP who knew that the only way to achieve peace was through strength. When MALCOLM announced that he would not seek a fourth term. he said \"I dont think the only place to fight for freedom is in the Halls of Congress.\" MALCOLM is still a very young man. and I have no doubt that he has many more years of fighting for Wyoming and fighting for freedom ahead of him.

They have this idea if it comes from the Federal Government. it is free. Well. it is not. The Federal Government cannot give anybodya mayor. a Governor. or anyone elsea dime that it first does not take from somebody else. It takes it from them in the form of taxes or borrowing. In this case. it is borrowing. So we are going to spend an extra $2.5 billion. In addition to that. we are going to spend $100 million in interest every year. probably. for the foreseeable future to pay for this amendment that our colleagues were so successful in defeating. But that amendment was Just $2.5 billion. This total package is $19.5 billion. I will tell my colleagues. that means we are going to be paying interest expense of $1 billion a year. in addition to paying for this spending. the socalled stimulus package. We are increasing interest expense about $1 billion for the next many. many years. I do not think that is responsible. Several Senators addressed the Chair.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I do not want to prolong this needlessly. but I do want to make two points. First of all. the larger point is that the stimulus package was part of the Presidents overall economic proposal. As because of the way we handle the legislation in the Congress. it had to be handled separately. If in fact it could have bern included in the total package that we are talking about. then clearly it would have been in the very same bill. It would have been part of the $502 billion deficit reduction. Actually. what you would have had instead of $502 billion. the deficit reduction would have been somewhat less than that. But this legislation comes to us on a separate basis because of how we have to handle this matter. But it has to be understood in the context of a very large deficit reduction package. The other point I want to maketo me this is an important point. others may not care about it very muchbut I do not see how you can have a rational debate here in the Senate if you do not. in effect. use figures accurately. What the Senator from Oklahoma has been doing is comparing the total cost of the CDBG Program only with respect to the Jobs it would produce in 1993. He gets a highly inflated cost per Job because he is taking all of the money. a good amount of which will produce the jobs subsequent to 1993. and costing it out using only the jobs it creates in 1993. What the President says in his program is that $2.5 billion in CDBG will produce outlays of $659 million in 1993. If you set $659 million off against your 15.894 jobs. the Senate will cut the cost per Job that he projected. It will be one quarter of what the Senator projected. You cannot-",

I had the good fortune to listen to it and hear him speak once more on the faces of health care. As he has indicated. these are real problems affecting real people. We oftentimes get so wrapped up in statistics and reports and the big picture that we really do not oftentimes have the opportunity to think of the effect that some of these issues have directly on the lives of people who we know and who we represent. So I appreciate his involvement and participation again this morning. As Congress. the President. and the public engage in a debate about health reform. we must never lose sight of our most important objective: to improve the quality of peoples lives. For this is not simply a debate about arcane principles of health care financing. As I said. this is a debate about peopleAmericans whose lives have been deeply affected by our health systems failings. And there are millions each year who become victims of the system. They are real people. not just numbers. They could be any one of us. They are a family that loses its health coverage and bankrupts itself when a child develops diabetes. a couple who lose their retiree benefits and must sell their possessions when the company for which they worked for 30 years reneges on its contract: small business owners who cannot afford coverage for themselves and must close the companys doors when they become ill. These are the faces of the health care crisis. They show up at every meeting I hold in South Dakota and write hundreds of letters each year. They pay their bills. contribute their taxes. and do everything the right way. They relay their heartwrenching stories and cannot believe that there is often little we can do. under the current system. to help them. They are shocked to learn that the United States. the richest country in the world. allows hardworking. taxpaying citizens to become impoverished when they fall ill. They learn this lesson the hard way.",

The Nation is becoming more and more reliant on the service industry and neglecting the foundation of a strong modern industrial nationits manufacturing base. Nowhere is this decline more evident than in the domestic metalcasting industry. Since 1970. employment in the metalcasting industry has declined by almost 200.000 people. production has dropped from almost 20 million to 12 million tons in 1990. and the number of companies that provide employment dropped from 5.100 in 1970. to 3.200 in Mr. President. the casting industry is essential to the defense of our Nation. Ninety percent of all manufactured products contain castings. In addition. 10 to 12 percent of all castings are produced solely and exclusively for military applications. Tanks. planes. ships. weapons. and a myriad uf other military hardware contain thousands upon thousands of cast parts. In view of the declining defense production. if the Nation is to maintain a modern healthy casting industry. we must be prepared to provide the means to conduct research and develop new technology. The American Metalcasting Consortium. which represents 3.200 foundries. has developed a plan to maintain the viability of this important segment of our manufacturing base. The plan identifies four areas of focus: Research and development. casting applications development. education and training. and. a small business innovation program.

    "speech": "Madam President. I support the amendment offered by Senator SHELBY and I think that it greatly improved the language contained in the bill. This amendment corrects certain problems that were created when the Senators amendment was adopted by the Armed Services Committee. Chief among those problems was the omission of language that would make this program to support the metalcasting industry subject to annual appropriations. I understand that the Senator intended to include such language as part of the amendment he offered in the committee. but that an earlier version without this correction was inadvertently adopted. I thank him for taking this opportunity to correct this oversight. This amendment also improves the original language by infusing the program with greater competition and by eliminating the authority given to the President to dispose of materials from within the national defense stockpile regardless of existing restrictions. Obviously. increasing the competitive aspects of such a program will enhance the longterm benefits to the Defense Department and increase the Departments ability to conduct proper oversight of the program. Removing the overly broad disposal authority may limit the amount of funding available for this program. but this will prevent the unintended consequence of overriding congressional restrictions set up in other legislation. Finally. this amendment limits the program to 5 years and to $10 million instead of $20 million a year. I dont believe the Senator intended this program to continue in perpetuity and this amendment corrects that problem. Additionally. $10 million will provide a sufficiently robust program to accomplish the objective of the legislation. Let me turn for a moment to those objectives. The metalcasting industry employs 265.000 people in all 50 States. primarily in small businesses. and generates $20 billion in output annually. These products are used in almost all manufactured goods. with 10 percent of the production being consumed directly by the Defense Department. This ckitic l industry has seen 25 percent of its ioundries shut down since 1980. It is entirely appropriate that the Defense Department lead this program as part of the larger defense conversion and industrial base efforts. I congratulate Senator SHELBY on his leadership and for offering these improvements to the original language.",

The amendment provides for costsharing arrangements by nonFederal sources to defray the cost of the program. if feasible. The amendment removes the $20 million. 5percent provision and authorizes $10 million per year. subject to annual appropriation. Madam President. I want to make this distinction: The amendment offered by my distinguished colleague. Senator SHELBY. Is altogether different from the bill provision to which Senator BINGAMAN now refers. We have to make that distinction. The Shelby substitute amendment would remove those elements of the bill which Senator BINGAMAN finds objectionable. There is much discussion about the Bingaman amendment. However. the Shelby substitute amendment addresses those concerns which are raised in the Bingaman amendment. So it is altogether a different situation which I want to call to the attention of the Senate. because I think there is some concern about portions of the bill which the Shelby amendment seeks to revise. Senator SHELBY has leaned over backward. He has taken out objectionable portions.

H.R. 3474 makes a number of significant regulatory reforms that will cut redtape and administrative burdens in the banking industry. These reforms will not mitigate safety in the banking industry. These reforms will not mitigate safety and soundness in the banking industry. Rather. they will help bankers cut their overhead costs which will ultimately enable bankers to strengthen their capital position which will strengthen the safety and soundness of the system and potentially make more capital available to the banks community. For example. H.R. 3474 calls for Federal and State banking regulators to coordinate their examinations and reporting requirements. which will help to minimize the interruptions and costs of bank examinations. Additionally. this legislation eliminates the duplicative disclosures for home equity loans. Having recently gone through this process with my local banker. I can safely say that the paperwork requirements involved with these transactions are great. Additionally. Congressmen RIDGE. FLAKE. and LEACH were successful in adding a provision to this legislation that will allow onethird of the funds authorized in this legislation to leverage capital in the private sector for community development activities. The socalled FlakeRidgeLeach provision will enable existing financial institutions to stretch the funds authorized in this legislation making more capital available in economically distressed areas which will result in greater economic development and growth.",

Today. the House will vote on H.R. 3474. a bill that includes not only President Clintons proposal for community development financial institutions. but also a substantial set of regulatory burden relief measures that will help all financial institutions squander less time. waste less paper. and loan more money to families and small businesses. These provisions of the Regulatory Reform Act of 1993. were carefully crafted to draw a distinction between burdensome paperwork and legitimate safety and soundness issues. No one wants to put the taxpayers at risk for a bailout of the bank insurance fund. On the other hand. stacks of forms are not always the best defense against bad banking practices. In the 102d Congress. the Banking Committee made substantial progress in protecting taxpayers by instituting riskbased bank insurance fund premiums and revising requirements for reserve capital. As Members know. it is a banks own reserved capital that forms the first line of defense against taxpayer bailouts. Capital is formed when banks are allowed to make money. By contrast. capital reserves are reduced when banks are forced to waste money complying with illconceived paperwork requirements. The House Banking Committee has taken a good bite out of some bad regulations. There are a few more regulatory issues that I believe deserve scrutiny. and I am sure that the committee will take an equally openminded look at additional regulatory burden issues in Mr. Speaker. in conclusion.

The regulatory relief undoes some of the provisions in FIRREA. Some of them I could live with. although I do not like undoing very many of them. But some are pretty severe. and I would point out one in particular to my colleaguesthe insider lending restrictions. Lending money to people on the boards of the banks is one of the things that caused many of the problems during the S&L crisis. There has been a rule that you could do it up to your capital. so a bank was trading its own capital. I even thought that was too lenient. Then we are going to say that the bank has no capital for any failure that is not insider trading. But this bill doubles it for small institutions between $100 and $250 million. Mr. Speaker. that is a mistake. I hope it will come out. We will regret the day that we passed something llke this.",

By incorporating large parts of H.R. 962. introduced this year by my friend. DouG BEREUTER. H.R. 3474 will help reverse the credit crunch caused by Congress when it passed the 1989 FIRREA and 1991 FDICIA legislation. And during the disastrous flooding in the Midwest. I worked with Chairman GONZALEZ and DOUG BEREUTER to pass DIDRA93. which provided regulatory relief in federally declared disaster areas. Today.

I believe that community development lending can be better enhanced through market incentives rather than through Federal programs. And I hope in the future. Congress will address those provisions of H.R. 962 which were not included in todays bill. These objections notwithstanding. I congratulate Chairman GONZALEZ. DoUO BEREUTER.

As my colleagues know. this legislation represents a number of compromises that have enabled the Banking Committee to advance the Presidents proposal to create community development banks. and to provide regulatory relief desparately needed by existing financial institutions. The bill contains most of the provisions of H.R. 962. Congressman BEREUTERS excellent bank regulatory relief bill. This legislation is strongly supported by the banking community in my State of Delaware. While I have reservations over the community development bank proposal to authorize $382 million in Federal funding for new community development banks. this legislation has been improved by the inclusion of the bank enterprise provisions offered by my colleagnes FLOYD FLAKE. ToM RIDGE. and JIM LEACH. I congratulate them on their good work. I want to thank the chairman and Congressman LEACH for agreeing to include the Radio Consumer Information Act as part of H.R. 3474 in addition to the Community Development Banks and regulatory aspects. The Radio Consumer Information Act. H.R. 3102. was introduced by Congressman LAROCCO and me in an effort to address a problem which has been unfairly damaging radio broadcasters ability to compete for advertising for automobiles and other consumer products involving loans and leases. The Radio Consumer Information Act will modify the Truth in Lending and Consumer Leasing Acts to allow radio stations to provide more effective consumer leasing and loan advertisements. Under current law. radio cannot compete with television or print publications for ads that require extensive disclosure of loan and lease terms. Our legislation will allow radio to provide loan and lease information through a tollfree number or other means prior to the sale. The Federal Reserve will establish reasonable regulations for this procedure. The legislation will protect the consumers right to complete information on the terms of a loan or lease before agreeing to a purchase. H.R. 3474 represents the type of workable compromise which can enable our committee to improve the banking laws of this Nation and I recommend its passage.",

I have spent time at banks to see firsthand how employees and consumers must wade through stacks of paperwork and unnecessary Government redtape. At one of the banks I visited a customer informed me that while refinancing his home he made between 8 and 10 trips to the bank to sign at least 39 forms. Bankers and consumers are justifiably frustrated by the excessive Government redtape they must wade through on a daily basis to conduct business.

Security Council Resolution 688. In November 1992. about 100 military personnel and their F16C fighters departed from Luke AFB to add their support to the air operation based in southern Turkey near the city of Adana. The mission of the 944th was to provide relief for the active duty forces who have been enforcing the nofly zone since April 1991. The air crews of the 944th worked around the clock to get the job done. despite harsh weather and limited living space. They performed exceptionally well whether it was providing maintenance. intelligence. or enforcement of U.N. Resolution 688. The dedicated personnel of the 944th did all this under the threat of a potential engagement with hostile Iraqi forces. The pilots of the 944th were on constant alert for any sign of the Iraqis breaking the nofly zone. Crews flew four to eight sorties daily. with each flight lasting 31/2 to 4 hours. They performed this duty with skill and expertise. ensuring that the Iraqis would not challenge the Security Council Resolution. Mr. President. I applaud the efforts of the men and women of the 944th. The 944th provided an outstanding demonstration of the highquality performance and training achieved by our Reserve Forces.

Mr. LEVIN. recently wrote an excellent article for the Los Angeles Times. in which he shatters recent arguments heard on this floor that uncertainty in Russia is justification to stop the very modest decreases in military spending planned by President Clinton. The President has proposed a very modest cut of $127 billion over 5 years. compared to President Bushs $1.4 trillion military spending plan. That amounts to a reduction of just 9 percent. hardly a gutting of our Defense Establishment. considering that the Pentagon justified about 60 percent of its budget to stop a sudden Warsaw Pact attack on Western Europe. During recent debates over the fiscal year 1994 budget resolution. some of our colleagues argued that since Boris Yeltsin might be replaced. or since his Democratic and market reforms might not succeed. therefore we should not proceed with the modest defense reductions. Mr. President. a change in leadership in Russia could present the United States with formidable foreign policy challenges. but the conventional military threat to Western Europe that existed for decades could never be reassembled without many years if not decades of warning. As Senator LEVIN said: The Cold War is over. but old Cold War thinking is not. Red ink. not the Red Army. is the greater challenge to preserving Americas strength. Mr. President.

Wally was awarded the Outstanding Engineer of the Year by the Central Chapter of Engineering Society in 1982 and the Governors Award for Excellence in Management in 1992. The efforts of Wally Larsen throughout the last 32 years have gained him the respect of everyone whom he has worked with. and South Dakota will benefit from the fruits of Wallys labor for years to come. I am pleased to have an opportunity to recognize him today.",

Del was president of the Township Officials of the State of Illinois at the time of his death. He was a resident of Cary. IL. in McHenry County which I had the honor of representing until the congressional reapportionment following the 1990 census. His death came as he was in his 18th year as the Algonquin Township highway commissioner. He was also president of the Cary Fire Protection District. the McHenry County Highway Commissioners Association. and the Wisconsin Aquaculture Association. His most active career included service as president of the Cary Chamber of Commerce. and the Fox River Grove Lions Club. He was also past board member of the U.S. Trout Farmers Association. A trout farmer. he owned the Lake Julian Trout Farm in Cary. The just mentioned record is proof enough of the time and efforts he gave to his communities. his State. and his profession. If a worthy cause put out a call for assistance. Del could be counted upon to hurry to its aid. Del Miller was a good friend of ours and he will be missed.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. incredibly. there is a debate going on on whether to call the situation in health care today a crisis or just a problem. Get real. It is a crisis. The reason I think some people have a problem calling it a crisis is because there is not any big explosion. There is no earthquake. There is no flood going on. And others simply do not have the political will or fortitude to make some very tough political decisions for this country. In 1992. 17.4 percent of the nonelderly population. that is 38.5 million people. were without health care coverage. That is 2 million more than the year before. Congress is working to help find health care access for tens of thousands of people. We are also. yes. today going to deal with the earthquake problems in California. and rightly so. So if we can help people in California with the earthquake aftermath. why can we not help the tens of millions of Americans who face a loss of their savings and their homes because they do not have health care coverage and get sick. Our health care system quickly becomes a crisis for anybody without insurance and does get ill. The letters from my constituents say. \"I think everyone should have the same health insurance coverage that you have as a United States Representative.\" I agree. Let us provide for our people in this country what we provide for ourselves.",

This I believe was a historic action and hopefully a turning point. For even a casual observer of our proceedings will note that an ideaa new concept won the day. That is remarkable in a Chamber where seniority and raw political power often reign. Maybe it was the influence of 2 months of being home with the people who sent us here. Somehow a commonsense idea like risk assessment won the hearts. minds. support. and votes of you. my colleagues. Together we made a statement that this Nation cannot continue to be choked by aimless Government regulation. We came together to say that there is a better way to conduct the business of the people. especially today with our limited Federal resources that are taken from the toil and hard work of our citizens. A commonsense idea prevailed that we should conduct an examination of the potential risk and the cost to the taxpayer and weigh that carefully against the benefit to public health and safety and the welfare of our environment. Even powerful partisan forces and bureaucratic turf protectors were cast aside for an idea whose time has come. Those who lost this vote should not view this as a defeat. but rather an opportunity. If we work together to restructure Government. we can incorporate new ideas. We can make Government and the regulatory process work. We can do a better job in managing our human and environmental resources. We can together offer hope to people who now view the conduct of our Government with only despair.",

The January 17 Northridge earthquake was a disaster of eipc proportions. It is estimated that the final damage estimates may range anywhere from $15 to $30 billion in uninsured costs. The human toll has been staggering. Tens of thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. leaving a large population of displaced homeowners and renters. Thousands of people were injured and many. tragically. lost their lives. These horrifying losses. combined with major damage to the areas transportation and utility infrastructures. hospitals. businesses. and schools. have created the greatest crisis in Los Angeles history. Although there were initial logistical delays and difficulties. the response by relief organizations and the Federal. State. and local agencies has helped to initiate the rebuilding and recovery effort. Given the magnitude of the damage. however. that monumental task cannot continue without Federal financial assistance. We must not waiver in affording immediate relief to victims of this disaster.

To say that such cuts are penny wise and pound foolish is to state the obvious. The General Accounting Office provides crucial information and services to the Congress that are unlikely to be available from any other source. As chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. I can personally attest to the value of this work. The General Accounting Office. for example. has been instrumental in identifying the increasing. potentially terminal problems faced by the Postal Service. The best information that the Congress has received regarding the loss of markets. the increasing threat posed by the electronic superhighway. or the problems with the Postal Services automation efforts has not come from the Postal Service. its customers. or its employees. but has been provided by the General Accounting Office. Committee investigators have been greatly assisted by GAO staff and investigatcrs from the Oflice of Special Investigations in reviewing grossly negligent operations of the Postal Inspection Service and in investigations of questionable activities at the Christopher Columbus Jubilee Commission. The General Accounting Office has been equally valuable to the Congress in the development of Civil Service policy. To date. the General Accounting Office has provided the foremost and best independent assessment of Vice President GOREs National Performance Review recommendations. Those recommendations contemplate what amounts to a complete revision of Government personnel policy. Particularly as those recommendations are translated into legislative proposals. the ability of my committee and the Congress to implement legislation that will enhance productivity will depend heavily on information that can only be provided by the General Accounting Office. Enactment of this amendment practically guarantees that such information will not be available. The General Accounting Office was established to provide Congress independent. nonpartisan. detailed information that Congress could not otherwise obtain. That information has been as invaluable to congressional efforts to identify waste. fraud. and abuse as it has in our efforts to develop policies that address the long and shortterm needs of the country. Gutting the General Accounting Office will not save a dime of taxpayers money. It will simply place the Congress at the further mercy of the executive branch and special interest groups.

I can testify that the GAO has been the key to helping us separate the fat from the muscle of the Medicare Program.

To give just one quick example. the GAOs work on abuses by physicians in the referral of patients to facilities in which they have an ownership interest has resulted in legislation that will save the public and private sectors hundreds ot millions of dollars per year. As chairman of the District of Columbia Committee. the GAO is currently playing a key role in deciphering the problem of the finances of the District of Columbia and pointing to areas where we need to make improvements in the Federal payment.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Ohio. Mr. BoEmINER. Madam Chairman. we have been sent to Congress by our constituents to put our Nations budget in order. They have grown weary of the strain of ever increasing tax burdens as our $4.5 trillion national debt grows out of control. I say to my colleagues that the first place we ought to start trimming the fat from the budget is the spending of the legislative branch. This amendment will cut some very unnecessary spending. For example. it will eliminate over S100.000 for automobiles for the House leadership. Madam Chairman. I. like most of my colleagues. drive myself to work. Why (do Members of the House leadership have to be driven here at taxpayers expense? The President has asked the American people to sacrifice in order that we may get Americas budget in order. Let the sacrifice start here. This amendment will freeze the spending of the legislature in fiscal year 1995 at fiscal year 1991 levels. Families all over America must keep their spending levels consistent with their income. I am not prepared to go back to my constituents and ask for more of their hardearned money so that the Botanic Garden can install an $80.000 security gate as they reconstruct the conservatory. also at taxpayer expense. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that we may demonstrate serious fiscal responsibility to the American people. I believe that it is the least we can do considering what we ask of them every April 15.",

I think it Is important that we be honest with the American taxpayers and admit that this bill will increase the amount of money Congress spends on itself by over $100 millionto nearly S2 billion next year. Each member of this body should go home this Memorial Day recess and ask his or her constituents if they believe Congress deserves a $100 million raise for the coming year. We all know what the answer would be. Until this body begins to adequately address the budget deficit crisis. it is highly inappropriate to increase our funding one dime. Let us lead by example.

On February 7. 1993. the Salt River project celebrated 90 years of dedicated service to the citizens of Arizona. This great organization provides a variety of services. including electrical power. to over 50.000 customers and a water delivery system that includes the following: Six Salt River project lakes. including Theodore Roosevelt Dam. water to industrial. municipal. residential. and agricultural users. and. over 1.300 miles of a water delivery system to serve over 240.000 acres of agricultural lands. The Salt River project is an invaluable energy resource to the State of Arizona. The Salt River project is also a good citizen whose community activities spread far and wide. It participates in community programs. encourages employee voluntarism. funds charitable causes. and promotes educational programs. Community service is a key element to the overall management of the Salt River project. Community service projects sponsored by the Salt River project includes: Energy conservation programs including an aggressive lighting efficiency program. major sponsor of Phoenix Clean and Beautiful. member of EPAs national Green Lights Program for customers. and. winner of the Governors Pride in Arizona Award for corporate recycling for 199192. Of special note to citizens across the United States is the estimated $430 million effort by the Salt River project to reduce by 90 percent sulfur dioxide emissions at the Navajo Generating Station located 80 miles from the Grand Canyon. When annual operation and maintenance costs are added it is estimated that more than $2.9 billion will be spent on this effort over the next 22 years. This initiative again demonstrates SRPs commitment to the environment and the people of Arizona.

Hard working families that cannot afford to send their children to college. Over 34 million Americans. most of whom work fulltime jobs. that do not have health insurance. And most middleincome families are working harder today than ever before but for lower real income. We cannot afford to continue with the stale and failed policies that have led us into this mess. If we stay the course we are on. our national debt will have doubled again by the turn of the century. Tonight President Clinton will lay out his economic plan to change the direction of our Nation. It is a bold plana plan that will put Americans back to workcreating millions of new jobs over 4 years. It is a responsible plan that demands that those who enjoyed the party of the 1980s now pay their fair share of the bill for that excess. No more leaning on middleincome families to pay for the tax breaks of the wealthy. Clintons budget addresses the real problems we face as a nationand it does it head on with honest. even conservative numbers. No more smoke and mirrors. no more budgetary deceit. It combines incentives for businesses to stimulate the economy and investment in our Nations infrastructure. with strict deficit reduction to achieve economic growth. including over 150 specific cuts in Federal programs.

But that investment must include not only the physical infrastructure of roads and bridges but our human infrastructure. boys and girls. and especially infants. They are our future. we must invest in them. Today in America. 30 percent of our 2yearolds do not receive the proper immunizations. In some cities. up to half the 2yearOlds have not been immunized. Measles has reached epidemic proportions. Tuberculosis is on the rise. Other childhood illnesses are killing our kids. Yet vaccines are safe and effective. What is more. vaccines make good economic sense. Every dollar we invest now. every dollar we spend now on immunizations will save $10 later in health care costs. I urge all Members to support the Presidents program to make vaccines available to the youngest and most helpless members of our American community.",

Those who question it or disagree are special interests and. at least in the Presidents mind. not patriots. I question the Presidents attempt to cloak his taxandspend program with the American flag. This country has many kinds of patriots. Some risked their lives to fight for their country in time of war and they are now facing the prospect of increased taxes on their Social Security. They are no less patriots if they question the need to increase their taxes while providing little in the way of meaningful deficit reduction. Many now feel misled because of President Clintons about face on giving the middle class a tax cut. Are those people unpatriotic if they express their anger at being deceived? Are they unpatriotic if they ask about cutting spending instead? If I remember history correctly. the first American patriots began by asking real questions about taxes.",

Patrick. a man who dedicated his life to public service in Antrim County which is located in Michigans First Congressional District. which I represent. Mr. Patrick passed away on July 26. 1991 and Is being honored by his friends and family on March 6 of this year. This is an honor that is long overdue as the State ol Michigan. especially the county of Antrim. has long reaped the benefits of his tireless dedication. First and foremost. Mr. Patrick was a good Democrat. He was active in the party all of his life. He served on the Antrim County Board of Commissioners for 15 years. During his time on the commission. he was both a commissioner and chairman of the board. Throughout his tenure. his integrity and honesty was never above reproach. He was always respectful and respected by others. It is important to note. though. that he was not just active in party politics. He was equally passionate about the larger issues facing his State and Nation. When Mr. Patrick was called to service in World War II. he went willingly and served with distinction. He later became a member and post commander of the George Puckett American Legion Post No. 264 in Mancelona. Mr. Patrick was also a member of the Mancelona Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He continued his community service through his involvement with the Antrim County Senior Citizen Center in Mancelona as well as the Commission on Aging. In this capacity. he passed on his caring and dedication to those in the community less fortunate than himself. And Mr. Patrick was truly fortunate. He Is survived by his wife Irene. his 9 children. 18 grandchildren. and a host of greatgrandchildren. The State of Michigan. and particularly Antrim County and the city of Mancelona will long remember his service. Mr. Speaker. the House of Representatives. where the citizens of the United States are served. Is a fitting forum to pay tribute to a man who gave much of his life to the people of his community. I rise today to thank Mr. Patrick for his years of service. and to let his family know that our thoughts are continually with them.",

Heinous and despicable forms of human rights abuses have been committed by warring factions who have shown complete disregard for the human dignity of the civilian victims of this war and have repeatedly and grievously contravened the Geneva Convention. Sadly. the litany of horrors devastating the lives of all those caught In this tragic situation grows longer every day. Crimes against humanity. such as the murders of civilian men. women and children. rape. mass executions. torture and the forced expulsion of civilians from their communities in the name of \"ethnic cleansing.\" are an affront to the human race. The international community has a responsibility to bring the alleged culprits in this conflict to trial if we are to make it clear that unspeakable atrocities are illegal and deplorable. While no party is blameless for human rights violations in this conflict. most of the evidence gathered by international observers indicates that the Bosnian Serb militias and their supporters in Belgrade have been chiefly responsible for the violence and turmoil. The rump government of Yugoslavia will remain Isolated and excluded from the family of civilized nations so long as their political leaders endorse and support what can only be described as calculated cruelty against their former countrymen. All reports of human rights violations are appalling. regardless of the gender of the victim. However. the stories which have emerged about the sheer scale and nature of the abuses committed against women. particularly Muslim women in Bosnia. during the conflict are offensive in the extreme. Human rights organizations have documented examples of the systematic brutality against women and children in Bosnia. Including gang rape. the incarceration of women and girls impregnated by rape. the forcing of women into brothels. and murder of rape victims and of children in front of their parents.

The club was founded on March 9. 1968. and during the last 25 years it has been a large part of Baltimores PolishAmerican community. The Polka Weekenders boast a membership between four and five hundred individuals who are dedicated to promoting Polish culture throughout the country. The group entertains at Polish festivals and thrills everyone with their wonderful dancing. The Polka Weekenders have performed for audiences in all 50 States. as well as in Poland and Mexico. In addition. the Polka Weekenders always are happy to teach their dances to anyone. Baltimore is a town rich with ethnic traditions and festivals. Every summer I look forward to seeing many of my Polish friends at the festival. Not only Is the food at the festival superb. I never miss the chance to see the very talented dancers. The Polka Weekenders amaze me with their skill and agility. and I relish the chance to join them for a step or two. In addition to providing much of the entertainment. the group members are involved In making the festival such a success. They work as volunteers in the many booths at the festival. The blend of Polish dancing. Polish crafts. and Polish food help to draw huge crowds from all over the State of Maryland. In its 25 year history. the Polka Weekenders also have done much charitable work in the community. This year. the organization plans to donate its time and money to the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore. Any organization which provides entertainment combined with benevolent work deserves special recognition. The Polka Weekenders attempt to pass on to other Americans and their younger generations a love of Polish tradition and culture. It Is so Important for all of us Americans to preserve and promote our ethnic heritage. Mr. Speaker. my fellow colleagues. it is with the utmost respect and admiration that I commend the Polka Weekenders on the groups 25th anniversary. May God bless them in the years to come.",

Culver City. which is located in my congressional district. received NODs top award of $2.500 for a community with a population of less than 50.000. The award was accepted by Ms. Patricia A. Hadley on behalf of Culver City. a member of the National Recreation and Park Associations [NRPA] Board of Trustees. Ms. Hadley was in Washington. DC for NRPAs midyear forum to construct its national issues agenda. The Culver City disability program was judged by a panel of private citizens as being a broadbased Initiative that educated the public about disability issues. In particular. the panel commended Culver City for publishing and distributing to all residents a quarterly newsletter about disability. sponsoring of a wheelchair basketball game during school hours against the varsity high school team. installing and audible crossing signal and providing funds for accessible picnic tables. improving accessibility to education. and providing funds for a job training program at a local junior college and $80.000 In community block grant funds for two group homes. Culver Citys comprehensive program excelled beyond the legal requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act by reaching out and providing equal access for the disabled in transportation. recreation. education. and housing. NOD was founded in 1982 with the intent of promoting full participation of Americas more than 40 million men. women. and children with disabilities in all aspects of community life. It is the belief of the National Organization on Disability that the best way to achieve full participation of people with disabilities throughout our communities is through local planning and action. As a result. NOD established its Community Partnership Programa network of nearly 3.000 towns. cities. counties. and military installations nationwide that work to Increase acceptance and full participation of persons with disabilities in all aspects of life. Culver City has been recognized as one such community. Mr. Speaker. please join me in acknowledging and applauding the contributions of Culver City in developing outstanding local disability programs which fervently seek to expand the participation of people with disabilities in all walks of community life.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it was with considerable apprehension that I recently learned of a secret campaign by the Iranian Government to deny certain basic freedoms to those who profess the Bahai faith. The policy in question Is set forth In a confidential document promulgated by Irans Supreme Revolutionary Council at the direction of Iranian President Rafsanjani and Irans supreme religious leader. Ayatollah Khomeini. and obtained by the United Nations Special Representative for Iran. Reynaldo Galindo Pohl. On its face. it directs that the progress and development of Iranian Bahai be blocked. that BahaI be expelled from or denied admission to Iranian universities if they identity themselves as Bahai. that they be denied employment for the same offense. and that a plan be devised to confront and destroy their cultural roots outside the country. This Is a chilling directive. It belies earlier indications of some diminishment In Iranian hostility toward the Bahai. Worse. it manifestly demonstrates a deliberate. callous plan to deny members of the Bahai faith basic freedoms and the means to earn a livelihood. Mr. Speaker. it is the obligation of all nations that respect basic human rights to condemn any effort to implement this cruel policy. It is further the duty of those of us who enjoy the complete freedom to exercise basic human rights. and most particularly the right to speak out against injustice. to constantly remind the rest of the world of intolerance and inequity whenever they rear their ugly heads. Finally. we must continue to monitor and document the behavior of those who would deny human rights to the innocent and unprotected. Mr. Speaker. I note with approval and support the efforts of members of the Bahai to publicize this deeply troubling document. Today. in fact. the Bahai community in the United States will hold a meeting here in the Capitol to brief Members and the press concerning the repression that could flow from the implementation of the secret Iranian Government policy directed against their coreligionist in Iran. We must use the power of our condemnation. and that of the rest of the world. to ensure that such a policy is halted forever.",

The Presidents plan calls for a mandatory 7.9percent payroll tax. This additional tax on hiring will cripple small business. and there is no guarantee that this tax will not increase in time. furthering the damage done to the backbone of the American business community. The Congressional Budget Office made several conclusions about the Clinton plan. First. it is a huge. untried expansion of government into the daily lives of all Americans. No. 2. it will create a greater deficit crisis than we already have today. over S70 billion for starters. And No. 3. every American family will be forced to pay for this plan with large payroll tax increases. But the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office is only part of the story. CBO did not talk about the implied rationing of the Clinton plan or the diminished quality or about the limited choice. the ability to choose ones doctor. Mr. Speaker. the Clinton plan is history.

I am honored to rise in support of House Resolution 343. legislation condemning the racist. antiCatholic. and antiSemitic speech of Khalid Abdul Muhammad. a senior representative of the nation of Islam. This resolution denounces all forms of racial. religious. and ethnic intolerance and I commend the distinguished gentleman from California . for introducing this resolution condemning bigotry and racism. As an original cosponsor of House Resolution 343. I am pleased that my colleagues in the House of Representatives have this opportunity to discuss this important resolution. It is highly important that we discuss this issue today. Racial intolerance within our communities. ethnic violence around the world. and religious persecution are frightening examples of the devastating affects of bigotry and fanaticism. It is for this reason that many of us in this body have found Khalid Abdul Muhammads remarks so reprehensible. Mr. Muhammads rhetoric. made during his speech at Kean College on November 29. 1993. symbolized the hatred. contradicts the foundation of our great Nation. and threatens to destroy the very framework of our open society. By preaching hatred. we incite and condone violence. by moralizing intolerance. we tolerate racism and bigotry. and by relying upon hateful rhetoric. we validate racial stereotypes. Instead of slandering our brothers. we must unite. We must join against the forces that threaten to destroy our future. As the Rev. Martin Luther King. Jr.. so eloquently said. \"We must all learn to live together as brothers or we will all perish together as fools. That is the challenge of the hour.\" Reverend Kings comments could not be truer today. than when he said them decades ago. Mr. Speaker. this resolution does not abridge the rights of free speech but does condemn the content and substance of Khalid Abdul Muhammads offensive remarks. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure. For the passage of House Resolution 343 is a dramatic step in combating ethnic and religious intolerance that threatens the fabric of our society.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. pharmaceutical research and development has brought us thousands of lifesaving medicines. Most of these drugs have been developed and tested in clinical trials for adults. with much less research on their uses and effects for children. One reason is that the Food and Drug Administration typically approves new drugs on the basis of studies conducted with adults. Drug manufacturers have little incentive to undertake costly additional research on drug and dosage effects on children. who are usually a small segment of the market for a new drug. That means fewer than a third of prescription drugs are labeled for pediatric use. Physicians can still prescribe them for children. but they have to estimate the appropriate doses. Estimates can be uncertain. especially because young children often metabolize drugs differently from adults. Some drugs can be less safe in children than in adults. even when appropriate doses are used. and side effects can sometimes be different. There is increasing concern among pediatricians and other health professionals about the lack of childcentered pharmaceutical research. and the need to encourage more. Thats why I am introducing the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act with my colleagues Congresswoman JOLENE UNSOELD and Congressman ROY ROWLAND. Similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate. This bill would establish a 6month period of market exclusivity for new drugs whose manufacturers conduct pediatric studies at the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Such studies would lead to appropriate labeling of drugs for treating children and take the guesswork out of an important part of medical practice. The bill does not allow a manufacturer to avoid competition simply because it wants to. The studies must be requested. and the protocols approved. by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. And the period of market exclusivity is limited to 6 months. regardless of how long pediatric studies may take. Mr. Speaker. the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act is a valuable step toward better medical care for all Americas children. I urge my colleagues to support it. The text of the bill follows: H.R.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.",

When completed. the church will encompass 12.000 square feet and seat 680 people. making it the largest Greek Orthodox church in the State of Michigan. The construction of this church is the last step in the fulfillment of the longstanding dream of the community of Sts. Constantine and Helen. Founded in 1930 by a few dedicated immigrants. the church had its beginnings in a storefront on the corner of Grand River and 14th Street in Detroit. As the community grew and prospered. a new facility was built on Oakman Boulevard at West Chicago. Again. the community continued to grow and so a new home was needed. Seven years ago the community purchased land to relocate their church. The construction was divided into two phases to allow time to raise funds. Phase I of the project. the building of the Hellenic Cultural Center. was completed in 1986. Parishioners currently attend Sunday services in the cultural center where a large photograph of the beautiful white marble altar from Oakman Boulevard stands as a reminder of the boxed pieces. currently in storage. that will br reconstructed in the new church. Phase H. the cons. ruction of the church itself. will at long last provide a permanent home for the cmmunity and its beautiful ikonostasin (altar cover). pulpit. and altar table. Today the community has 450 families who worahip and participate in religious. social. and cultural activities. With the addition of the church to the already existing Hellenic Cultural Center. they will have the opportunity to expand its activities and grow with its parish.

Forty years ago today. the Nations highest Court spoke In one clear. unanimous and ringing voice that the Constitutions guarantee to every person of the equal protection of the laws prohibits official school segregation in the Nations publiu schools. Brown was more than just a judicial decisionit was a powerful call to redeem the promise of the Constitution and remove the stain of racism from the fabric of our society. The legal battle that produced the Brown decision was a heroic one. The battle was led by Thurgood Marshall. the brilliant lawyer who headed the NAACPs team of lawyers and who later served with such magnificent distinction himself on the Supreme Court. Justice Marshall was aided by one of the best legal teams ever assembled: William T. Coleman. Jr.. who later served brilliantly as Secretary of Transportation. Louis Pollak. Robert Carter. and Constance Baker Mottley. all of whom went on to serve with great distinction on the Federal bench. Two other outstanding lawyers on the team were James Nabrit and Jack Greenberg. Their goal was to abolish the hateful Jim Crow laws that existed throughout much of the Nation. and with Brown and the cases that followed it. they succeeded. Today is a day to remember one of the greatest triumphs in our judicial history. and to honor the people who turn the dream of Justice for millions of our people into a constitutional reality. A recent article by Patricia J. Williams which appeared in the Nation. which is entitled \"Among Moses BridgeBuilders.\" describes the history of the decision. and its continuing legacy. in the lives of the Brown children. Although their names will be forever attached to the cause of desegregation. the Browns insist that they not be made into icons. that it is the struggle of all AfricanAmericans that deserve to be remembered and honored.

I state my strong opposition to a proposal in the Presidents budget for fiscal year 1995 to transfer the administration of the Emergency Food and Shelter Program from the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] to the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD]. For over 10 years. the Emergency Food and Shelter Program has been a very successful program that is exemplified by a partnership between FEMA and 6 highly creditable and effective national nonprofits. This partnership is responsible for a program that has been able to deliver aid both effectively and efficiently to countless thousands of persons in thousands of communities facing hunger and homelessness. In particular. the Emergency Food and Shelter Program provides assistance to over 10.500 nonprofit and governmental local agencies which provide direct service to homeless and hungry people nationwide. This program has distributed over $1 billion since it began in 1983 and. in many States. is the largest source of Federal assistance available to service providers for homeless people. This program funds food banks. soup kitchens. and shelters as well as purchasing directly food and shelter for the homeless. It also provides emergency homelessness prevention services. notably rent or utility assistance. for individuals on the verge of becoming homeless. What makes this program even more special and unusual is that over 97 percent of the funding goes directly to people needing emergency food and shelter. this means that less than 3 percent of the funding goes to administrative costs. I urge my colleagues to oppose the transfer of the Emergency Food and Shelter Program from FEMA to HUD. As they say: Dont fix it if it isnt broken. This program isnt broken and it doesnt need fixing. This program does not need to be transferred to HUD. to do so risks the tremendous success of the program.",

True education reform must be driven locally. by parents. teachers. local administrators. and the community as a wholenot the Federal Government. H.R. 6 relies far too heavily on Federal control. It will stifle locally driven reform. Under current law. ESEA covers 61 programs. President Clintons proposal to reauthorize ESEA contained only 26 programs. Unfortunately. many programs were added back by the majority during the committee markup. As it stands. the number of programs in H.R. 6 is back up to a grand total of 48. The problem with so many programs is a lack of focus and priorities. When the Appropriations Committee designates funding. it will try to fund as many programs as possible. thereby diluting funds to the larger and broader programs like chapter 1 and chapter 2.

I am impressed that there is a basic philosophical issue here. The gentleman from Texas Just talked about all the details and all the things we might do. There is a basic philosophical question as to what the role of the Federal Government is in education. I rise in support of more flexibility for local schools. Local schools are quite different. they are quite different in Basin. WY. than they are in Baltimore. MD. and I think we have to have that kind of flexibility. I rise in support of more concentrated. blockgrant approaches to Federal funding of education where local people can make the decisions. And. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the core Federal programs. chapter 1 and chapter 2. I have been very involved in education. I have been on a school board. My wife is a teacher. my family has teachers. I am interested in that. I am chairman of the Disabilities Council in our State. and I know we need these programs. but I am amazed at the things that come up to sort of clutter the area of helping in this area. My problem with H.R. 6 is not with the motivation behind the legislation. but behind the implementation. H.R. 6 contains many now reporting requirements. focuses on inputs instead of results. funds several narrowly defined categorical programs and generally expands the role of the Federal Govonment in education in conflict with the philosophy I have. The Michel substitute recognizes the legitimate role the Federal Government has in education. While maintaining the important core programs in H.R. 6. and the funding that goes with it. the Michel substitute eliminates the Federal micromanagement found throughout H.R. 6. The Michel substitute promotes flexibility from excessive Federal regulations and allows local schools the freedom to innovate. It seems to me that is a more appropriate role for the Federal Government. and I encourage my colleagues to vote for the Michel substitute and against H.R. 6.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. as I said when we began this discussion way back in the Dark Ages. the staffs in a bipartisan way did an outstanding job in bringing to the committee an outstanding piece of legislation. I truly believe that we messed it up somewhat after the subcommittee and the full committee began to work with it. The Michel substitute would be the ideal piece of legislation to take into conference with the Senate. and then we would not encourage the Senate to add 18. or 20. or 30 more programs. So again. like the Governor. I plan to support the legislation that the committee has developed. with the hope that by the time it gets to the Presidents desk. we will have corrected many things that. as I said. we messed up in committee. In the meantime. however. it seems to me that the Michel substitute is the ideal place to start with when we are going to negotiate with the Senate.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the substitute offered by the gentleman from Illinois. Before I came to this body I had the opportunity to serve on a local school board for several years. I served with four concerned members of the community and together we spent countless hours trying to meet the needs of the young people for whom we were responsible. A friend of mine once told me that people who serve on school boards are going to have a special place in heaven. When I was first elected to the board. our budget was approximately $16 million dollars. At the end of my 9 years. that budget waa up to $40 million. Over 85 percent of this money came from the State and Federal Governments. Thats a lot of money and I think we could have done an excellent job of educating our young people. The problem was that even though we were elected as local. onthespot officials. we had very little say in what went on in our schools. While the Federal and State Governments sent us most of the money. they sent even more mandates. We were constantly trying to do all the things they asked us to do rather than do what was really best for the children. Im a strong advocate for local control of the educational process and for minimizing Federal and State mandates. I assure you those I know who serve on local school boards would give up that special place in heaven to have more say in the educational process. Mr. Chairman. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Michel substitute.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise tonight in support of the Michel substitute to H.R. 6. the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I appreciate the opportunity we have had to openly and fully debate this issue. We have made a number of improvements over the last couple of weeks. Having said that. I still have to come to the conclusion that this legislation still goes too far. I have received a tremendous number of calls and letters against H.R. 6. and people know that we face a dramatic change in educational policy. What we face with HR. 6 is a dramatic move toward greater Federal control and mandates if H.R. 6 is passed as iR. I support flexibility in Federal policy. For those who agree with me that states and localities should make the decisions which affect their own children in the schools in their communities. vote for the Michel substitute. For those who agree with me that opportunity to learn standards are the camels nose under the tent. vote for this substitute. For those who agree with me that Federal guidelines should be minimized and limited resources should be focused on programs which do the most good. not what we in Washington think work. vote for the Michel substitute. A good example of what the Michel substitute would allow school districts to do is allow them a great deal of flexibility. It would allow for schoolwide strategies. schoolwide projects. that would let the schools take a look at the Federal dollars they are receiving. and rather than trying to meet a formula or specific project criteria. take these funds and allocate them to the specific needs of that school district. of the children in that school. We do not tell them where to use the money. but we trust local school districts. local teachers. local parents. and local school boards. to trust their judgment to spend it the best way that they feel is necessary. A vote for this substitute is a vote in support of your local school districts and students everywhere.",

What we believe is that we ought to get this money to students and schools who need it in America in the most efficient way. with the least red tape and bureaucracy attached to it.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to explain the reasons for my vote on H.R. 6. the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization. During the course of the debate on this bill. I have become very concerned with potential unfunded mandates that may result from its enactment. As a result of this concern. I have attempted to amend H.R. 6 so as to make the model opportunitytolearn standards. contained In title 1. voluntary. I am somewhat pleased that an amendment was added to title 1 which stipulates that the implementation of opportunity.tolearn standards will be voluntary for States. Unfortunately. States will still have to develop these standards. even though they will not have to implement them. There are no doubt other mandates in H.R. 6 which may result in direct costs to States and local school districts. It has been reported that H.R. 6 contains 23 new reporting requirements for State and local education agencies. For this reason. many have suggested that we defeat this legislation. And while H.R. 6 certainly has flaws and a better bill could probably be drafted. it Is important to realize that H.R. 6 Is mustpass legislation. The overwhelming majority of Federal programs for our public schools will receive their authority under H.R. 6. In order to continue these programs. such as chapter 1 and Even Start. we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. So just as I did earlier this week when I voted for the Goals 2000 education reform bill. I will be reluctantly casting my vote In support of H.R. 6.",

I called for the resignation or firing of Joycelyn Elders. I have just asked permission to put into the RECORD the letter written by Cardinal Hickey. the Archbishop of Washington. DC.. and environs. to the President demanding that he disavow and censure Joycelyn Elders. the Surgeon General. for her remarks which appeared in a homosexual publication. The Advocate. This is the second time in just 8 months that an Archbishop has written forcefully to condemn the remarks of this Surgeon General. At this point I would like to submit that letter. Now I find in the paper a second issue. which I missed yesterday: \"Of the 1.000 FBI background checks of White House personnel. more than 500 revealed derogatory information that would have prevented these people from obtaining FBI security clearances. The FBI found cases of past drug use. drug convictions. years of unpaid taxes. unpaid debts. and financial irregularities. all discrepancies that are grounds for Secret Service questions.\" The White House denies this and says it is only 100. Do you remember my words here last September and October. Mr. Speaker? I said that Bill Clinton could not have gotten a security clearance to serve in any agency of any administration. Only by getting elected President could he obtain a clearance. The flower generation. the hippie sixties generation. has come to Washington. DC. and It is a nightmare. The Wall Street Journal today printed a letter written by DAN GLICKMAN and LARRY COMBEST. good men from the Select Committee on Intelligence. It is a letter asking CIA Director Woolsey what steps he has taken to ensure that classified material has not fallen into the hands of those who do not have proper clearance. It is a letter I asked him to write. I will include with my remarks the entire Wall Street Journal editorial with the letter from the chairman and ranking Republican of the Committee on Intelligence.

    "speech": "OF THE UNITED STATES. The White House. IWashington. DC. MY DEAlt MR. PRESIDENT. I must take strong exception to the recent remarks of the Surgeon General. Joycelyn Elders. advocating homosexual behavior and the expressing support for adoption by socalled homosexual couples. Furthermore. I deeply regret her apparent intolerance of people whose religious faith and moral values collide with her own illconsidered views. The Surgeon General irresponsibly accuses religious leaders of holding that human sexuality is solely for procreation. Her words are a misleading caricature. In our Catholic tradition the two fundamental purposes of human sexualitythe expression of the committed love of husband and wife and openness to new human lifeare linked together. Human sexuality is a great gift from God which enables couples to express their love for one another and in the context of that love to create and care for a family. Such a view is supported both by faith and reason. it does not involve the suppression of human sexuality but rather its right use for the good of individuals and society. The strength of our country. Mr. President. has always been in the vitality of our families. not in the might of our weapons. By contrast. the breakdown of the family has been the root of so many of the social problems which. as a nation. we now struggle to overcome. The comments of Surgeon General Elders are destructive of a true understanding of family life. It is one thing to defend the human rights of homosexual men and women. it is quite another to encourage. as she does. a lifestyle which puts socalled homosexual unions on a par with marriage and family and condones homosexual behavior among young people. Mr. President. I strongly urge you to take responsibility for the Surgeon Generals harmful and offensive remarks and publicly to disavow them. Respectfully I ask that you urge Dr. Elders to be more tolerant of religious teachings with respect to human sexuality. Whether she knows it or not. the religious teachings. leaders and institutions which her remarks attack are vitally Important to solving many of our nations social ills. Sincerely in Christ.",

Over the past 6 months the Banking Committee has been monitoring the rapid growth of newfangled financial instruments called derivatives and I have ordered my staff to draft legislation that would call for further regulation of derivatives. As part of our review of the risks posed by derivatives. the Committee has been studying one of the major purchasers of derivative productshedge funds. Bank lending to these highly leveraged and largely unregulated investment funds raises a number of serious safety and soundness questions about hedge funds and their use of derivatives. Hedge funds are one of the largest purchasers of derivative products from banks. and that status alone makes them worthy of scrutiny. But hedge funds deserve extra scrutiny because their massive financial clout. fueled by large credit lines from banks. is used for speculative purposes. This speculative activity has grown so great that it has a tremendous effect on the stability of our financial markets The Congress and regulators must make sure that they understand the impact of hedge funds on the stability of our financial markets and the banking system. Based on recent events. it appears that hedge funds are increasingly being viewed as a growing threat to the stability of our financial system. The only way to understand that threat is to learn more about hedge funds. debunk the myths. and develop supervisory strategies to control those risks. To execute that strategy the regulators must begin to require greater disclosure about bank exposure to hedge funds and the securities regulators need to require greater information about hedge fund operations. As a first step to ensuring that the regulators are learning all they can about the risks posed by hedge funds. the Committee will hold a hearing to explore the implications of bank exposure to hedge funds on Wednesday.",

To qualify for the best of the best. hospitals had to place within the top 10 in at least 4 of 16 specialities. Membership on the elite list also required that a hospital must be affiliated with a medical school. be a member of the Council of Teaching Hospitals. have a ratio of interns and residents to beds of .25 or more. or score nine or higher on a technology index that represents one of the nine objective indicators of quality. UCSF has passed these tests with flying colors. The University of California at San Francisco Medical Center was named as the seventhbest hospital in the United States. and the UCSFaffiliated San Francisco General Hospital was named as the best center for AIDS care for the third year in a row.

I strongly agree with the author that instead of simply providing more money for unnecessary and wasteful education programs we must replace the current failing education system with a framework which gives parents a greater role in their childs education as well as the freedom to choose where to send children to get the best education possible. and at the same time allows local education authorities the flexibility and freedom from burdensome overregulation so that they can be creative and innovative in introducing reforms. We must change the focus of current education reform effort from supporting the education bureaucracy to actually helping Americas children establish a pattern of lifetime learning and becoming the best and the brightest in the world.

And. contrary to expectations. the United States did itself proud by hosting a terrific World Cup. with great enthusiasm and much participation from American fans. And this year. before viewers from all corners of the globe. Team USA made every American proud by beating the odds and going significantly further than even the most optimistic among us could have hoped. But also. Mr. Speaker. I would like to join my Brooklyn constituents in applauding another amazing team. Another team which beat the odds to get further than was thought possible. The team from Italy. former Motherland to so many of us here in Congress as well as Brooklyn. made us proud in their attempt to be the first team ever to win four World Cup championships. After a dramatic onegoal victory over Bulgaria in the semifinals. the residents of Brooklyn poured into the streets to celebrate the valiant and emotional victory of Team Italia. The celebration expressed the passion for Europes most famous team that has earned them one of soccers greatest heritages. Pride and joy filled the streets as the \"Forenza Italia\" rallying cry was shouted by the spontaneous gathering. Freedom of expression was never better exemplified than during this outpouring of emotion. Unfortunately. the valiant team from Italy. like the courageous team from America before it. fell to Brazil. One kick separated both teams from the glory of winning. but both teams will for ever be in our hearts. Even though World Cup 1994 is finished and the team from Brazil was crowned champions. the applause for both Team Italia and Team USAs underdog efforts will be recognized long past World Cup 1998. So. dont cry for us. Brazilor even Argentina. Unless. of course. you are crying: \"Go USA and Forza Italia.\"",

Vera Cruz left behind a legacy of commitment and dedication to social justice. Vera Cruz immigrated to the United States in 1926 from the Philippines with ambitions for a higher education and a career as a lawyer.. He sacrificed those ambitions and chose to dedicate himself to supporting his family by working in the fields on the Pacific Coast. In 1965. Vera Cruz joined the Agricultural Organizing Committee of the AFLCIO and led a successful Filipino sitdown strike in the Coachella vineyards. Later that same year he joined forces with Cesar Chavez to form the United Farm Workers [UFW]. Vera Cruz held the position of vice president in the UFW and was the highest ranking Filipino officer. Upon his retirement from the UFW. Vera Cruz moved to Bakersfield and lectured frequently to college students on labor and social issues. I wish to extend my sympathy to the Vera Cruz family. The spirit of Philip Vera Cruz lives on in the work of grassroots organizers all across the country. We are eternally grateful for his efforts.",

I condemn it in the strongest terms. and I am dismayed that there are people in the world who have condoned this heinous crime. I take the floor today to note the prompt and decisive actions taken by the Government of Israel to heal the wounds caused by the Hebron massacre. Prime Minister Rabin visited Hebron to express his sorrow. He denounced the butchery. calling it a \"shame on Zionism and an embarrassment to Judaism.\" He established a commission to investigate the killings. He released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. He imposed a now restrictions on Israeli settlers. These gestures of goodwill are the acts of a statesman. and demonstrate clearly that Prime Minister Rabin is committed to keeping the peace process on track. Thus far. Prime Minister Rabins efforts have received only lukewarm response from the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Seizing the political moment. the PLO leadership seeks greater concessions from Israel. It is not my purpose in speaking today to discuss the terms of the Middle East peace process. That is the business of those who live in the region. But I believe that Israels actions should not go unnoticed.

Since 1957. when the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights was first established. our Nation has made considerable progress in fulfilling the promise of equal rights. But the problems of discrimination have hardly been solved. in many ways. they have just grown more complex. The Nation continues to need a Civil Rights Commission that is true to its original purpose as an independent. nonpartisan. factfinding agency. Mr. President. it is no secret that there have been some problems at the Commission over the years. particularly during the 1980s. Many who have worked tirelessly in the civil rights community for years. and who have observed and worked with the Commission during that time. continue to have some skepticism about the work of the Commission. Frankly. the Commission needs to do a better job of reaching out to the organizations and communities with which it has worked closely in the past. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights should not just react to the civil rights issues of the day. but should provide leadership on these issues. It is my hope that the Commission can once again raise the consciousness of the Nation on civil rights matters. I believe that the Commission is now headed in that direction. The legislation I introduce today will reauthorize the Commission for a 3 year period through the end of fiscal year 1997.

For example. as late as 1877 someone was denied admission to the New York Bar because he was Jewish. Recently. the Jerusalem Post had an interview with him in an article written by Matt Nesvisky that gives a sense of perspective to all of this. The heading of the story is \"The Decline and Fall of U.S. Antisemitism.\" I would not agree with inclusion of the words \"and fall\" in the heading of the article. and I am not sure Leonard Dinnerstein would. What is clear is that there has been a great decline. and the nation is richer for that decline.

Mr. Strong works in a small company and is currently uninsured. Under the Gephardt bill. by January 1. 1997. he will be guaranteed health insurance. He will have four choices: A private plan offered by his employer. A provider plan offered through the Federal Health Benefit Program. If his employer chooses not to offer private coverage. he may obtain coverage through Medicare part C. If his employer chooses Medicare part C. he will have a choice of a plan offering an unlimited choice of doctors or a managed care plan. A medical savings account. if offered by his employer.

Inc.. who maintain contact with potential gang members and other atrisk youth. This program has several components. including outreach. prevention. crisis intervention. victim support. and education. Plans for a future residential safehouse are also under way. Services have been rendered largely by unpaid volunteers representing numerous agencies in a variety of settings. Schools. housing projects. recreation centers. churches. and civic organizations have all served as sites for GANG program activities. Mobile was recently designated as a weed and seed city by the U.S. Department of Justice. GANG. Inc.. has been very active in the weed and seed initiative and has contributed much to its subsequent success. Perhaps the most visible achievement of GANG. Inc.. has been the establishment of the nonviolent posse. a group of 17 young men who managed to sing their way right to the famous Apollo Theater in New York City. This proud accomplishment certainly demonstrates how commitment of time and effort can contribute to full realization of potential for young people who might otherwise be deemed atrisk. Most recently GANG. Inc.. has been working closely with the Boys and Girls Club of Mobile. the Mobile Mental Health Center. the Girl Scouts. the Mobile Police Department. and the Mobile Sheriffs Department to Implement a Federal grant directed by the Mobile Housing Board to eliminate drug abuse and gang violence in public housing. These initiatives are supported and strengthened through cooperation with the Coalition for a Drug Free Mobile County. the Mobile County Juvenile Justice Coordinating Council and the U.S. Department of Justice. Such community coalition building is characteristic of GANG. Inc. Mr. Speaker. June 27 will mark the second anniversary of the Group Against Narcotics and Gangs. Few organizations can boast so many achievements in so short a time. Congratulations on a job well done.",

It is estimated that last year over 100.000 Chinese were smuggled into the United States. If the trend continues. this figure will markedly increase this year. Even if these individuals are caught. they can delay and possibly escape deportation simply by asking for political asylum. As the June 9 editorial in the New York Times correctly notes. \"Amedcas ad hoc asylum policies have slipped out of whack with postcoldwar realities. This Member would ask that this editorial. entitled \"The Golden Venture. Plus 100.000\" be entered into the RECORD. I would commend this insightful article to my colleagues.

There are 15 Federal Agriculture Department plans that may be currently requested or carried out by farmers and ranchers on their lands under programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. Thus. farmers and ranchers and their lands are being planned. examined and studied extensively under several existing laws. The result is that these committees are extensively involved at the present time with conservation. environmental. and biological activities on farms and ranches operated by tenants and/or owners and held and maintained as nonFederal real property. The purpose of this legislation is stated to be \"to provide a national focus for research and monitoring of Americas biological and natural resources on an ecosystem bases\" and as noted the Secretary of Agriculture administers several programs that are directly or indirectly related to the bills purpose through these State and county committees. Notice of survey activities in the States and counties will be beneficial to the Department of Agriculture as well as the individual farm owners and/or operators who obtain much of the data about their soil. conservation practices et cetera from these State and county committees. The Secretary of Agriculture or his representative will serve on the National Biological Survey Science Advisory Council created by this bill and no doubt U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies will be among those who may be requested to cooperate with the Director of the National Biological Survey.

In the Natural Resources Committee report. the term is defined as \"plants. fish. invertebrates. and wildlife inhabiting terrestrial. aquatic. and marine ecosystems.\" The ecosystems themselves are not part of the definition of biological resources. In the substitute that is before the House. the word \"and\" has been strategically placed so that biological resources now include not only the plants. fish. invertebrates. and wildlife. but also the terrestrial. aquatic. and marine ecosystems in which they occur. This means that land. water. and air are now biological resources. I would amend the definition so that the definition adopted by the committees of jurisdiction is the controlling definition.

The $170.319.000 authorization is based on the fiscal year 1994 appropriation for the National Biological Survey and the national wetlands inventory. This figure represents a 20percent increase over existing funding for these programs. There are other pressing needs in the Department of the Interior for management and stewardship of public lands which are not addressed in this legislation. For example. the National Academy of Sciences issued a study last year expressing grave concern about the ability of the National Park Service to manage its resources effectively. Instead of addressing these needs. resources are being put into the National Biological Survey. I am concerned that other research and management responsibilities within the Department will suffer. Limiting the authorization to 2 years gives Congress the opportunity to assess the National Biological Survey and exercise its oversight responsibilities. Essentially what we are doing here is cutting back a little bit of money. placing a limit on the funding. assuring that the authorization is sure enough that we can do it the right way.

As we all too well know. sometimes an idea that seems to be good on paper turns out otherwise. This amendment would allow the Survey 2 years to get organized. After that time Congress would have the opportunity to reexamine the Survey during the authorization process to determine whether the funding levels are adequate and whether the Survey deserves to be reauthorized at all. In the interim the committee will have the opportunity to conduct oversight hearings to determine the progress of the Survey. For those who support this bill wholeheartedly my amendment does no harm.

The amendment is clearly not germane to this bill. The National Biological Survey is not a regulatory agency and has no control whatsoever on how or even whether any agency uses the science or the data generated by the National Biological Survey. The bill does not address at all how or even whether data collected by the survey will be used. Madam Chairman. this amendment attempts to tie the use of the biological survey science in a regulatory context to a hypothetical reduction of property value. If information generated by the survey is used for wetlands or endangered species. regulatory purposes. and if that regulatory decision causes a greater than 50 percent reduction in the fair market value of the private property. then the Secretary. according to the amendment. shall compensate the landowner. I would simply note that the amendment establishes a standard for determining when the loss of property rights is compensable and lays out the method and process for providing such compensation. and. however fascinating and interesting those matters may be. and I agree that they are substantively important policy issues. they have nothing whatever to do with the subject matter of the fundamental purpose of H.R. 1845.

Madam Chairman. this amendment would prohibit any action under the act if it would result in a taking of private property. directly relative to the piece of legislation we are debating. This amendment would also provide for compensation to the property owner if the fair market value of the property is diminished by 50 percent or more as a result of a limitation on property use because of action taken under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. the Endangered Species Act due to information from the Survey. which is the subject matter of the debate before the House. The Secretary and the landowner have a variety of options to use when it comes to compensation. Also. such compensation would be funded by the land and water conservation fund. I think the House made great strides earlier toward restoring the faith of the American people in the Government when we approved private property rights protections earlier during consideration of this legislation. This amendment builds upon the amendment already accepted by the House by assuring Americans that they will be compensated if Government regulations cause them to lose the value of their property. and. if we are to succeed in protecting and preserving the environment. we are going to need the faith and good efforts of the private property owners. and the best way to get their cooperation is to provide them with incentives and protection from loss. Again. that relates directly back to the basic and fundamental subject matter of this particular piece of legislation.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to voice my strong support for continued funding for space station Alpha. It seems fitting that as the country has taken time to fondly remember the 25th anniversary of Apollo II and Neil Armstrongs first steps on the Moon. that we are once again deliberating whether as a nation. we have the foresight and fortitude to make this investment in our future. I believe a manned space station is the next logical step for NASA. America simply cannot afford to bypass this tremendous opportunity. I commend NASA for restructuring the space station to reduce its cost. and for reaching out to include our friends abroad. For the first time in history a multitude of nations will be working handinhand in space exploration. The restructured space station offers the United States and our allies an unparalleled ability to gain a better understanding of the universe around us. At the same time. a permanently manned station will enable us to conduct longterm experimentation to help devolop solutions to many pressing environmental and biomedical problems. The distinguished Senator from Maryland. Senator MIKULSKI. has been a champion of the space station. She and I may have differing views on many policy issues. but the space station is not one of them. On May 30. she wrote. \"The death of the space station would be a national tragedy.\" I couldnt agree more. Several weeks ago the House sent a clear message to the American people and to our international partners that the Federal Government is committed to the space station. If NASA is to do its job. explore space. then we must stop haggling back and forth about this issue yearafteryear. The Senate must send a strong statement which once and for all will put an end to the yearly debate about building a space station. We owe it to our posterity to explore the universe to the fullest extent possible. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Bumpers amendment and to support continued funding for space station Alpha.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I strongly support the BumpersWarner amendment to terminate funding for the space station. This program is a black hole in the Federal budget we simply cannot afford. In light of many other more compelling obligations. this program is neither costeffective research. nor a wise investment in terms of our partnership with the Russians. In 1984. NASA estimated the space station would cost $8 billion. To date. we have spent closer to $11 billion. with a revised price tag from NASA of $17.4 billion to complete construction. Once built. we will face a whole new set of obligations associated with the maintenance and operation of space station Alpha. Where will it end? Our national debt is rapidly approaching $5 trillion. If uncontrolled Federal spending continues. our debt will increase by an additional $1 trillion by the year 2000. We are mortgaging future generations with this profligate spending. A recent article by Laurence Kotlikoff and Jagadeesh Gokhale. which appeared in Public Interest. drives home this point. To finance todays borrowing. the authors conclude. Americans born at the turn of this century will have paid just over a fifth of their lifetime earnings to the governmentwhile those born after 2000 will have to forfeit closer to half of their overall earnings. Most research planned for the space stationespecially the life sciencescould be done cheaper elsewhere. In 1993. the presidents of 10 scientific societies said in a joint statement that the space station is a: * * * multibilllon project of little scientific or technical merit that threatens valuablo spacerelated projects and drains the scientific vitality or participating nations. Finally. Mr. President. Russia simply is not a reliable partner for a longterm investment of this magnitude. It is impossible to ensure stable United StatesRussian relations for the decades it will take to complete this project. The space station partnership is not necessary to advance our foreign policy interests. Ample cooperative research among our two nations already exists in the areas of weapons dismantlement and nuclear reactor safety. Moreover. the current plan directly contradicts the United States goal of encouraging more privatization in Russia. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to vote for the BumperWarner amendment to terminate space station Alpha and to stop this wasteful spending.",

It was a difficult choice and I cannot fault the sincerity of either side of the debate. I voted against the station last year. when it was largely a wing and a prayer. but this year the station has come light years both in terms of its design and its mission. In addition. I found myself strongly influenced by the foreign policy implications if we were to eliminate funding. NASA now faces the challenge of living up to its promisebuilding the station within budget and on schedule. If it succeeds. the Nation and the world will be able to point with pride at a highly visible example of U.S. leadership and international cooperation.",

I believe that this is not the time for lyrical words or high sounding rhetoric. It is time to talk reality. and therefore I am going to make a very factual statement and bring to the attention of the American people what I believe they need to know as they watch us vote on this amendment. The total cost to the American taxpayer is not $71 billion. as some people would say. There is $10.1 billion already spent. $17.4 billion for assembly completion and $13 billion for 10 years of operation. The total cost to the Americans will be $40 billion from the year 1984 to the year 2002. I also want to bring to peoples attention that the space station is now capped at $2.1 billion annually. This is oneseventh of 1 percent of the total Federal budget. or 59 per year per taxpayer9 bucks to take us into the future. The total cost is capped at $17.4 billion between now and the year 2002 when it is completely assembled. Now. let us talk about these new designs that everybody says is just one more cost overrun. During these new designs. we used 75 percent of space station Freedom elements that we spent nearly $11 billion to develop. We have got cost savings over space station Freedom. It is going to cost us less to assemble. and we are going to have fewer civil servants and fewer managers. Freedom was going to have 24 civil servants and now we will have less than that. Let us talk about the wasted effort. What have we got to show for the $11 billion we already spent besides paper and viewgraphs and arguments that make this seem like a technofolly. Well. as I said. 75 percent of the design for space station Freedom will be used in the international space station Alpha. 25.000 pounds of flightquality hardware for the space station is built and it is in its final qualifications stages. a mission control facility at Johnson Space Center.",

I believe it Is appropriate that the United States has worked through organizations such as the United Nations and the Organization of American States. to build an international consensus prior to unilateral action. I believe it is appropriate for the United States to recognize that we have a special responsibility In the Western Hemisphere. and thus events such as are occurring in Haiti have a resonance and a impact outside that immediate island nation.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to express my strong opposition to H.R. 5. Yes. there have been identifiable abuses by employers of their legal right to hire replacement workers during economic strikes. The plain truth. however. is that these cases are the exception rather than the rule itself. and this rule today penalizes all employers. Only in very rare circumstances will an employer faced with a strike and with a need to maintain operations decide to hire permanent replacement workers. In fact. the General Accounting Office [GAO] found that only 17 percent of strikes in 1985 and 1989 involved replacement workers. with only 3 to 4 percent of strikers being permanently replaced. This legislation will undermine the balance in the collective bargaining process and. in the long run. foment increased labormanagement conflict and costly strikes. The right of employers to hire permanent replacement workers has long been the counterbalance to the right of employees to strike in the labormanagement relations design contemplated by the National Labor Relations Act. The balance of power which serves as the foundation of the NLRA compels each side to the bargaining table to negotiate an agreement that is fair to both the employers and employees. This legislation would take away managements economic leverage. while leaving labor with a completely unfettered ability to exercise its right to strike. H.R. 5 will cost jobs. not secure them. We should be focusing our attention on the need to address unfair labor practices. and on the need to address expediting the process of the National Labor Relations Board. We should not be pushing legislation which will accomplish nothing but economic disruptions to our productive capacity in an increasingly competitive global economy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. over 50 years ago this Congress passed an act allowing workers to join together and negotiate the conditions of their employment with their employer. the conditions meaning retirements benefits. the hours they would work. the safety conditions under which they would work. and. yes. their wages. For over 40 years we recognized that right to organize together and negotiate together with your employer as the right that you would have to continue working once the labor negotiations were concluded. For 40 years that worked. Approximately 12 years ago we seemed to change the philosophy in this country by saying that if you chose as a result of those negotiations that you could not get together and the employee found it necessary to walk off the job in protest. then that employee can be fired and permanently replaced by someone else. Let us look at what this proposed legislation actually does. It merely says that if workers have joined together and they must be recognized as a bargaining unit. that if they negotiate and fail to consummate those negotiations within a period of time. the employer may. temporarily. continue his operation with supervisory personnel and temporary workers. He may continue his operation. The employees then must find it necessary to go out of the plant. yes. on a work stoppage. The employee suffers because his pay stops. The employer does not suffer. because he may continue his operations with temporary employment as negotiations continue. This is a fair balance. If we then take away the right of the employee to return to his place of work when the negotiations cease. where is the fairness? There is no balance.

In 1946. my dad went on strike for 111 days. Let me tell you. there will always be pain for the workers during strikes. I was a junior in high school during those days. and the Kildee household really suffered in 1946. I and my classmates at St. Marys School could not buy new clothes. Our neighborhood ate cornmeal mush more often. Many seniors could not order their class rings. Many house payments in that area of town were not made. There is suffering. My mother is 93 years old. and that year. 1946. when she was 46 years old. was one of the most miserable of her life. almost as bad as during the peak of the Great Depression. My dads employer did not permanently replace him during that strike. but the pain was very. very real. and this bill will not eliminate the pain and suffering of the strikers. My dad voted freely for that strike in 1946. and he never for a moment regretted that vote. It was a very important thing to raise the standard of living of workers in the city of Flint. MI. He never regretted that vote. But during that strike there was much suffering. much suffering. and his family felt that suffering. And I am proud to this day of my father for voting for that strike.

The right to strike and the right to replace strikers are key elements in the procedures established in the current National Labor Relations Act. If indeed there is a problem with the balance of employer/worker rights--and this Member is not convinced that there is--the way to address it is not to remove the 50yearold distinction between an unfair labor dispute and an economic strike. That is what H.R. 5 does. Current law recognizes that economic selfhelp is an integral component of the collective bargaining process. Market forces are a key factor in determining the outcome of bargaining disputes. The rationale of the National Labor Relations Act is that an employers ability to hire permanent replacement workers is the most reliable barometer of the legitimacy of the strikers wage and benefit demands. Further. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 5 would do little to increase the protection already available to striking workers. Under current law. returning strikers may not be discriminated against with regard to wages. benefits. seniority. or terms and conditions of employment. The use of replacement workers is already limited by several constraints. In 1990. the Bureau of National Affairs reported that replacements were used in only 14 percent of all strikes in the United States. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 5 would increase the number of labor disputes. it would remove from the collective bargaining equation the key determining factor of market forces. and it would do precious little to augment current protections available to striking workers. This Member simply cannot support a bill with such negative ramifications and such little practical benefit to anyone. including potential striking workers.

It is not something that workers do frivolously because they want to force the company into a corner. I have been a union negotiator.

I know firsthand the problems of successfully running a profitable business. I know what it is like to compete with companies that are continually trying to cut corners by shortchanging its workers. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this bill will upset the balance of power between labor and management that was originally created through the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act and the 1938 Supreme Court decision in MacKay Radio and Telegraph Co. verses the National Labor Relations Board. But to believe this argument you would have to assume that: Labormanagement relations have not changed during the last 50 years. The ability of workers to earn a decent living in a good job has not changed in 50 years. The Federal Government has dealt equitably with labor in the last 50 years. and Management has negotiated in good faith during the last 50 years. Tteso--of course--are false assumptions. Anyone who has picked up a newspaper in the last 50 years knows that this socalled balance of power is a contradiction in terms. In 1981 the Reagan administration set the tone for labormanagement relations for the 1980s by permanently replacing striking members of the PATCO air controllers union. But the PATCO strike was Just the tip of the iceberg. The well known GAO study on striker replacement found that in the 1980s employers raised the threat of permanently replacing strikers in onethird of all collective bargaining negotiation. In cases where the employers have hired permanent replacements. what would have otherwise been a temporary interruption in the labormanagement relationship. turn into full scale wars that are harmful to workers. harmful to their communities. and is even harmful to management. After an employer has hired a permanent replacement. it has little incentive to develop any compromise to break the strike. America too will be harmed if this imbalance of power continues to grow. Our Nation cannot build the strong foundation for sustainable economic growth without the restoration of workplace fairness. For that reason.

Mrs. UNSOELD. highlighting the Greyhound strike as evidence of why legislation to ban the hiring of permanent replacement workers Is necessary. First. I would make the point that the Greyhound strike involved charges of unfair labor practices. and where a strike is instigated or furthered by unfair labor practices committed by the employer. striking employees would have a right to immediate reinstatement at the conclusion of a strike. This right to reinstatement is provided by current law and I support this right. I would add. however. that the Greyhound strike provides a perfect example of the need for reform of the case management processes at the National Labor Relations Board. an Issue which I have long argued should be the focus of our debate on improving the collective bargaining process. The tentative agreement settling the Greyhound strike. over 3 long years after the admittedly very bitter strike began. requires Greyhound to pay $22 million in back wages to union drivers. recall 550 of the remaining strikers. reinstate most of the 200 strikers who were fired for alleged misconduct. and increase hourly pay for drivers to $16.55 per hour from $13.83 per hour by Whatever you think of the merits of this settlement. we all must agree that a 3year delay in closing the book on one of the most hard fought labormanagement disputes of this decade does not provide justice to either employers or employees.

Mr. Chairman. this bill is of paramount importance to working Americans because it further prohibits employers from giving any employment preference to a striking employee who crosses the picket line to return to work before the end of the strike. This measure thereby overturns ohe 1989 Supreme Court decision which has affected thousands of employees who at the end of a strike find that their jobs have been replaced by those who crossed the picket line as employers are allowed to give preference to them over senior employees who were simply exercising their working rights. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 5 must be passed by the Congress to stop the decadelong practices of unscrupulous employers from taking advantage of a loophole in our labor laws to hire or threaten to hire permanent replacements. This threat has been used by employers so much in the past decadeaccording to a GAO report. was raised by employers in one third of all collective bargaining negotiations. I have been told that employers have come to view ccilective bargaining not as a means of negotiating wages and working conditions. but of recruiting a new work force or permanent replacements. Contrary to opponents of this bill. this measure will not tilt the balance in labor relations unfairly toward workers. Passage of this bill will continue to affect workers who go on strike as they will continue to lose their paychecksand employers will still continue to retain their many options to continue operations by hiring temporary replacement workers. Finally. Mr. Chairman. this legislation will not apply to nonunion workplaces. I urge my colleagues to strongly support American workers by voting yes for H.R. 5.",

In the spirit of the great labor leader Cesar Chavez. to vote In favor of a new era of peaceful and equitable resolution of labor disputes. During the 1980s we saw the dissolution of the balance between labor and management. During the past decade we have seen that threats to replace striking workers permanently actually deters the process of collective bargaining. which is at the heart of any partnership. Our major trade competitors. Including Japan and Germany. prohibit permanent replacement for strikers. To compete In the global market. the United States needs a stable and cooperative relationship between labor and management. Today we can restore the balance and revive the core elements of the collective bargaining system by allowing American workers the right to strike without the risk of losing their jobs. Mr. Chairman. today I honor Cesar Chavez and his lifelong fight for workplace fairness. I urge my colleagues to end this era marked by bitterness and mistrust. and vote In favor of the Cesar Chavez Workplace Fairness Act.",

There is a lot of good in the defense bill. but each and every one of us has some problems with it. and I have some concerns myself. I believe that the American taxpayers pay for the defense of Japan and Germany and Europe to the tune of about $100 billion. That is. \"b\". a hundred billion. Now. I know they say that protects American interests when we send all this money over there. but I want the Members to think about this. The taxpayers of American send a check over to Frankfurt to an American soldier who cashes his check at a bank in Frankfurt. Then he goes out and he buys clothing in Heidelberg. or he goes to dinner in Dusseldorf. or in fact they may take in a theater at some point in Rome. or some American soldier may cash his check and buy sushi in Tokyo. This amazes me. And yet we have millions of illegal aliens running across our border. and Congress is feverishly trying to find money to finance new Border Patrol agents. I Just cannot believe how dumb the Congress of the United States can be. Now. I say to the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Texas that I have a little amendment to offer. It has been on the books for 3 years. and I have been jacked around. Here is what is says: The Traficant amendment says the Secretary of Defense can take some of these soldiers. who are falling out of chairs without armrests in Europe. and relocate them on our borders so we do not have to come up with more money and bankrupt American families and taxpayers. And they can work with immigration. they can work with the Border Patrol. they will not violate posse comitatus laws. and they will help to keep out illegal aliens. heroin. brown Mexican heroin. crack. guns. and people that end on welfare programs. And that is not a statement being made against Mexico and southern America. I know the problems we have. I want my amendment in the damn bill.",

We now have the opportunity to use this funding to accomplish other goals. both foreign and domestic. However. we must not and we cannot walk away from nor diminish the importance of the work that we began over 50 years ago. Our alliance with our North Atlantic neighbors must not be forgotten. That relationship with our European allies was the catalyst for establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. the most successful alliance in the history of civilization. So we must continue to actively participate in that alliance and contribute to the common security that is the hallmark of NATO. In that regard. I strongly urge this great body to support the ceiling that was set by last years defense bill of maintaining 100.000 U.S. troops in Europe by the end of 1996. Any efforts or any amendments offered here today to reduce these numbers would seriously undermine NATOs goal of common defense and undermine the ability of this Nation to secure our vital interests overseas. The United States can be proud of its initiative embraced by NATO to establish a partnership for peace. and now. as NATO forges this partnership with our former adversaries in Eastern Europe. we share the responsibility of overseeing this effort and maintaining a presence that is representative of our position in NATOs strong and succeosful democrat community.

I have got a doozey for them. The Democratic leadership has denied the Members of this House the opportunity to lead by example and cut congressional spending on itself by 25 percent. Yesterday Republicans made a simple request. We asked the Democrats- to make in order a floor amendment which would have cut the congressional fat. not across the board. but in a careful and reasoned linebyline way. Our amendment would have cut unnecessary committee staff. but kept 100 percent of the funding for books for the blind. It would have cut political mail expenses. but left 100 percent of the funding for the handicapped tour service. It would have preserved 100 percent of the Library of Congress. but cut some of the expense of over 5.000 employees for the General Accounting Office and hold that to onethird of a billion dollars per year. just that one part of our staff. It would have provided full funding for all important constituent services. Many analysts have noted that all of the staff on the Hill has actually contributed to legislative problems. The staff prepare bills of over a thousand pages in length which come to the floor without Members having had the opportunity to read them. and bad legislation is the result. We can save the taxpayers money and do a better job for the country by cutting back some of the staff which now numbers over 30.000 people to serve 535 Members of Congress. Overall. our amendment would have saved the taxpayers more than $450 million in fiscal year 1993 alone. yet the Democrat leadership denied us even the opportunity to debate this bill on the floor. This is an outrage. President Clinton has promised to cut the White House staff by 25 percent. and he has challenged the Congress to do the same. The American people have been asked by the Democrats in Washington to share in the sacrifice. and yet the leaders of this House will not extend that sacrifice to the Congress itself. The least that we can do here is lead by example. The Democrats refusal to do so is without question the outrage of the week.",

I understand that it is politically popular to go back home and pose for political holy pictures by beating up on this institution. but the fact is that this institution has a constitutional obligation to produce a legislative product independently of the wishes of the executive branch of government. We have done so with virtually no staffing increase over the last decade. We have done so by squeezing our budgets much more tightly than the budgets have been squeezed in either the Senate or the executive branch of government. In fact. if you compare what we pay our own staff in this House versus what the Members of the other body pay their staffs. and I would point out we have to do every bit as much work as has to be done in the other body. except for approving treaties and screwing up the Anita Hill hearings. but outside of those two functions. we perform every function that the Senate does. and yet the Senate pays their administrative assistants 30 percent more than we pay them in the House. They pay their legislative directors 50 percent more than we pay them in the House. They pay their State district directors 40 percent more than we pay in the House. They pay their press secretaries 50 percent more than we do here. If there are additional savings to be made. it seems to me they ought to be made in the branch which has demonstrated insufficient attention to cost savings. That is not the House of Representatives. As the chairman of the subcommittee has pointed out. we have had a real decline in the purchasing power of the budgets of this House for a long number of years. I happen to chair a committee. for instance. which had not had a single staff increase for over 10 years. It seems to me that Members often are tempted to take advantage of the lack of knowledge on the part of the public of the facts about this institution. but the facts are that we have run a very tight budget for the last 10 years and we deserve some credit for it.",

Freshman Democrats understand that government must do with less and that that effort must start with the Congress of the United States. Madam Chairman. we note that the bill before us this afternoon cuts the budget 6.4 percent. This comes after a 6.5percent cut last year. representing 13 percent. nearly a 13percent reduction. This is on track with our goal. a very tough goal of a 25percent reduction to be achieved over 5 years. Madam Chairman. we think the bill before us can be improved with some amendments that will offer further trimming. and I will be sponsoring one myself in a minute or two. But by and large this bill represents a very substantive effort at reducing the budget and appropriately funding the legislative branch.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I recently received a copy of a report funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health entitled \"The Effectiveness and CostEffectiveness of Chiropractic Management of LowBack Pain.\" This report concludes that chiropractic care proided by qualified professionals is safe and effective. In addition. it suggests that. for certain diagnoses. chiropractors often provide high quality care at a lower cost than physicians. I am intrigued by the results of this report and commend it to my colleagues attention as we continue our efforts to reform our health care system. Sufferers of low back pain have faced conflicting advice concerning methods of treatment. They also face high costs that often leave them with few choices when only medical services. not chiropractic treatments. are covered by their insurance companies. This is unfortunate. I believe insurers. both public and private. should expand the range of practitioners available to patients. not restrict them. As you know. Mr. President. the United States has traditionally kept alternative forms of medicine on the fringes of society. As we pull nonphysiclan practitioners into the mainstream. we must protect patients from harmful treatment. while still allowing them to choose the method and practitioner they prefer. especially when evidence indicates that a group of practitioners provides high quality. costeffective care. At at time when we are looking for better and more costeffective ways of providing health care for our Nation. I encourage my colleagues to fully examine the possibilities of chiropractic and other allied health care professionals. The report follows:",

I can remember clearly as a child watching these proud officers as they rode their horses in parades and other ceremonial and special events.

And they have served with distinction. providing security on more than one occasion for Presidents of the United States and other important dignitaries who come to Detroit. Inspector Patrick Muscat and his mounted police have much to be proud of. Their drill team is recognized as one of the best in the Nation. What is not as well known. however. is the role these officers perform. both on and off duty. in community relations.

For too many years. Federal legislators in Washington. DC. have passed the cost of Federal programs on to State and local governments. Congress needs to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to imposing financially burdensome regulations on State and local governments. I am pleased to join my colleague. Senator DIRK KEMPTHORNE. in promoting S. 993. the Community Regulatory Relief Act. This legislation would exempt State and local governments from new Federal regulations that were determined to be unfunded by the Congressional Budget Office [CBO]. Having served as the mayor of Indianapolis for eight years. I am personally familiar with the burden local officials face when scrambling to pay for Congress new programs. Mr. President. I would like to include in the RECORD the following resolution issued by Indiana officials today: Whereas. unfunded mandates on State and local governments have increased significantly in recent years. Whereas. Federal mandates require cities and towns to perform duties without consideration of local circumstances or capacity. Whereas. local projects and needed services have been eliminated or postponed because the United States Congress has increased unfunded mandates and regulatory control while reducing financial assistance. Whereas. executive Federal burdens on municipal governments force some combination of higher local taxes and fees and/or reduced local services. Whereas. Indiana municipal officials do not wish to see municipalities reduced to custodial outposts for the Federal governments policies. and Whereas. the National League of Cities. the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns as well as other State and local government organizations have begun a national public education campaign to help citizens understand the issue. beginning with a National Unfunded Mandates Day. October 27. 1993: Now. therefore. be it Resolved. That the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns supports actions to inform the citizens and taxpayers about the devastating impact of these mandates on local discretionary spending for sorely needed improvements: Be it further Resolved. That the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns calls upon our State and Federal representatives to heed our call and support legislation to curtail such unfunded mandates.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to present today for consideration by the full Senate. legislation to reauthorize the Federal Trade Commission. I. along with Senators DANFORTH and GORTON. introduced this legislation on June 29 of this year following an oversight hearing by the Consumer Subcommittee. The bill was reported overwhelmingly by the full Commerce Committee on August 3. The legislation provides authorizations for the Commission for fiscal years 1994 through 1996. This legislation is virtually identical to bills that have been passed by the Senate on numerous occasions. As you know. Mr. President. the FTC has not been authorized in over a decade. This. in my opinion. is too long for any agency to be without an authorization. and certainly for an agency as vital as the FTC. The Commissions authorization has been held up because of unresolved differences between Members of the Senate and House over the expansiveness of the FTCs authority in certain areas. The issue that has been of most concern is the issue regarding restrictions on the ability of the FTC to apply its unfairness rulemaking authority to commercial advertising. Several Members have expressed concern about the promulgation of potentially broadbased rules that might intrude upon or prevent legitimate commercial speech and believe restrictions are necessary. Although there have been bills considered by the Senate and House in the past. the two bodies have not met officially in three Congresses to discuss those issues. I am sure that Members of both the House and the Senate realize that this is an issue that will have to be resolved through an understanding by both bodies. As I stated when we introduced this legislation in June. I am optimistic about the passage of an authorization bill for the FTC this year. A bill already has been passed by the House. Therefore. Mr. President. I am hoping that we can pass this legislation unanimously and proceed as quickly as possible in convening a conference with the House in order to resolve these issues.",

Section 301 of the trade bill. which he authored. protects American workers by addressing the issue of trade barriers which harmed American exports. Senator RIEGLES commitment to rebuilding American cities. especially the rustbelt communities of the Middle West which were devastated in the economic dislocation of the 80s. is well known. He fought for urban development grants and was an early advocate of enterprise zones. The landmark legislation coming out of the Banking Committee during his term as chairman strengthened communities by stabilizing financial and real estate markets thrown into chaos by the S&L collapse. But his principal concern has always been for workers and their families affected by the structural changes in the Nations economy. Over a Presidential veto. he led the fight to extend unemployment coverage. He put a human face on the health care crisis in his weekly floor statements featuring Michigan citizens and their problems with the health care system. His legislation setting uniform standards for \"Medigap\" policies protected vulnerable senior citizens from exploitation. DON RIEGLE leaves the Senate with the economies of Michigan and the United States healthier than they have been for many years.

A fiscal conservative. he demonstrated his commitment to his personal beliefs by cosponsoring legislation calling for a balanced Federal budget and supporting efforts to reduce the Federal deficit. He can point with pride to the fact that during his service in the Senate. we passed by far the most sweeping budget deficit reduction plan in decades. During his tenure as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee. he supported efforts to strengthen U.S. trade policy. Senator MATHEWS felt strongly that our Nations economic future was linked directly to improving our Nations trade performance. In line with that view. he sponsored legislation to emphasize the importance of trade relations between the United States and the Asia Pacific nations in an expanding global market. As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senator MATHEWS was a strong voice for Tennessee on issues ranging from coal production to research and development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and preservation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He cosponsored legislation to strengthen the Department of Energys ability to work with industry and educational groups to share research and technological advances. Senator MATHEWS also has been a team player. He has repeatedly assumed responsibility for presiding over the Senate to relieve other Senators from that obligation. His many courtesies and kindnesses to his fellow Senators will long be remembered in this body.",

Deputy Staff Director for Congressional Affairs at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). who is retiring after 25 years of dedicated public service. For the past 15 years. Ms. Broderick has worked closely with the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees on numerous defense readiness and acquisition issues. She has worked hard to ensure that the Congress has had ready access to the material necessary to make informed decisions. She was especially effective in assuring that the impact of military logistics was properly considered in our readinessrelated initiatives and in helping to clarify the tremendous complexity of acquisition reform. Ms. Broderick has been a consumate professional. Her candor. energy. and dedication have served as an inspiration to her colleagues. and reflect the best traditions of public service.

Mr. Thomas was an employee of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate with 24 years of Federal service. In 1954 he enlisted in the U.S. Army and during his military career he served in Europe and Asia. In 1963. Mr. Thomas attended Officers Candidate School at Fort Benning.

MITCHELL. who cast his last vote in the U.S. Senate this evening. will be appointed U.S. Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State for Economic Initiatives in Ireland. It is welcome news that the majority leader will continue. at least in the near term. in public service. for it is a pursuit to which he seems to be uniquely qualifiedalthough by no means limited. Senator MITCHELL is in fact the ideal candidate for any job requiring vision. wisdom. integrity. and leadership. Indeed. how many other Americansin the space of less than 1 yearare deemed to be the number one candidate for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. Commissioner of major league baseball. and now Special Advisor to the President on Ireland? The answer. of course. is none. For Senator MITCHELL is a leader of singular abilities and singular achievements. Since his election as majority leader in 1988. he has led us with incomparable strength and unwavering conviction. but also with immeasurable patience and an uncompromising sense of fairness befitting a former Federal judge. It is difficult to imagine how we will get along without Senator MITCHELLS formidable presence hero in this Chamber. Just prior to the votes on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade implementing legislation. the majority leader delivered a masterful speechas he does before every major vote--in favor of the GATT legislation. It reminded me how much we will miss the majority leaders superb oratory. his lawyerly precision. and his rare gift for persuasion. The majority leaders retirement from the Senate will be a great loss .o this institution. to the State of Maine which he has represented so ably. and to the Nation. We are terribly saddened at his departure. but gratified and comforted by the knowledge that he will be continuing on in service to his country.",

In specific point of fact. the 154th Group is more than integral. It is exemplary. This September. it was presented its fifth Distinguished Flying Unit Plaque from the National Guard Association of the United States.

The House came up with its bill. which was a very bad bill. It was $27 billion. Then the liberal conferees came up with a $33 billion bill. Suddenly. it jumped $11 billion from a really good bill that we passed here. The bill has been somewhat improved by this last conference. by what the House did. It has not been improved enough. Frankly. what we would like to do is improve it some more. but the only way we can do that is to sustain a point of order that it violates the Budget Act and then work out the final anticrime materials that have to go into it. That is what we are trying to do here. and that is what we are going to do if we can. We think America would be much better off if we do. I do not think the distinguished Senator from Delaware has to worry about losing very much. The only thing we will lose is maybe a little bit of time. But we can get this bill so it is much better and would have overwhelming support in both Houses of Congress. That is all I am dedicated to doing and. frankly. I would like to see us have that opportunity. There is still a lot of pork in this bill. When we passed our $22 billion bill. it was $2.3 billion in prevention programs. part of which was. of course. the violence against women bill on which Senator BmEN and I have worked so hard. All of a sudden. it jumped to almost $9 billion. and now it is down to $5.3 billion. but $3 billion more than the Senate bill which some thought had too much pork in it as it was. It is time to change that. Madam President. let us see what we can do in the next day or so. and if we can. it will be for the betterment of our country. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

These institutions were established at the Bretton Woods Conference in New Hampshire in 1944. The 1944 Bretton Woods Conference had a significant international impact and served as a turning point in international economics. Among other achievements. the conference established a goldbased global monetary system. Gold now serves as civilizations primary form of money in almost every marketplace in the world. The Bretton Woods Conference created the IMF. World Bank. and GATT to promote global economic cooperation. enhance growth. increase trade and investment. and increase financial stability in the postWorld War II era. They are considered among the worlds key development organizations. When established. the main goals of the IMF and the World Bank were to manage the global economy and promote international economic development. GATT has been highly effective in reducing barriers to world trade. The \"Bretton Woods Revisited\" reunion. commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of IMF. the World Bank. and GATT. will be held October 1517 at the Mount Washington Hotel in northern New Hampshire. It is sponsored by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. The reunion will serve as a time for the founders and new members of the organizations to discuss various issues dealing with the worlds current and future economic challenges. Speakers such as Edward M. Bernstein. Harlan Cleveland. Paul H. Nitze. and Tran VanThinh are just a few of the 40 founders and original members that will be attending the conference in Bretton Woods this October. As a U.S. Senator representing New Hampshire. and a frequent visitor to Bretton Woods.

I think he really puts it so well. and I can only tell one little anecdotenot quite as many as the Senator from Ohio canabout Quonset huts. When I was a young boy. near the University of Arizona there were four square blocks set off with Quonset huts. There was a military unit stationed there during the war. and I went down there with my father to visit a friend. I remember spending some time in this little neighborhood and I thought it was wonderful. What a great little place. all these neat little houses and places the military kept up. People were not complaining. Of course. housing was short in those days and these were relatively new Quonset huts. They were torn down maybe 15 or 17 years ago when the new medical school was put up. But during that time they were used for student housing and students were glad to have them. They were low cost although they required some maintenance because of their age. But why we cannot do as the Senator from Ohio points out and put our prisoners in this kind of housing is beyond me. Why do we have to spend thousands of dollars per square foot in some instances. certainly multiple hundreds more than the NRO or CIA or Defense Department is spending on their buildings. to build prisons?

That is the State of Arizona. and the Senator from Arizona was the attorney general there at one time. The planning for that may have occurred when he was still the attorney general. I do not know. Arizona moved forward on this. Other States are beginning to follow. We wrote into this bill to encourage the Attorney General to encourage this by means of where grants go. and so on. There just is not any doubt in my mind. I do not understand the opposition to it. They were not as pretty as big buildings. but they will work and will lock people up and the justice system will mean something for a change. not become a scofflaw out there. It will mean something.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I introduce legislation to correct an inequity that occurred in the budget process last year. While Congress has historically treated Federal civilian and military retirees equally under the law. the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that was recently signed into law contains a disparity in the schedule of future cost of living adjustments [COLAs] for civil service and military retirees. The problem of military retiree pay inequity arose out of decisions made in the budget process last year to reduce COLAs for both retired military and retired Federal employees. Instead of reducing COLAs. a decision was made to continue with full COLAs but delay the effective dates of the COLAs each year to achieve the directed reductions over 5 years. Funds were available in civilian accounts to alleviate the impact on civilian retirees but no additional funds were available in the military retiree accounts. As a result. Federal civilian retirees will have their COLAs delayed until April for the next 3 years. Military retirees. on the other hand. will have their COLAs delayed until April 1994. but in 199598. their COLAs will be delayed until October. In total. Federal civilian retirees will have their COLAs delayed for 9 months while military retirees will have their COLAs delayed for 39 months. Mr. President. this is clearly an unfair situation. We have an obligation to ensure that military retirees are treated equitably with their civilian counterparts. Therefore. I am introducing legislation that will restore equity by placing military retiree COLAs on the same schedule as those for Federal civilian retirees. Inflation does not discriminate between military and civilian Federal retirees and neither should we. I recognize that funds will have to be identified to pay for this change in the schedule for military retirees. It is not my intent that all of these funds should come from the defense budget. I do intend to work with the leadership of the Budget Committee. the Appropriations Committee. and the Governmental Affairs Committee to find suitable offsets and reach a satisfactory solution to this problem. I urge my colleagues to join me in this legislation to provide fair and equitable treatment for all our Federal employees. both military and civilian.0",

I have always hoped for and supported the proposition that we should move in the direction of encouraging more contributions from ones own district or ones home State. I think that Is a very wholesome direction in which to move. That is why I supported the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island earlier. under which funds could not be raised outside ones home State in a Senate race until the last 2 years of that cycle. It could not be raised throughout the full 6 years. I think that does move us in the direction that we should rely upon inState contributions first. Secondly.

Mr. President. that I believe adoption of an amendment such as the one proposed by my good colleagues at this point would endanger the support for the bill. It is a careful balance. and there are a number of Senators. particularly from small States. who at least up to this point in time have not been able. because of very small financial resources in those States. to raise a majority of their contributions inside their home States. So. Mr. President. while I am sympathetic with the thrust of what my colleagues want to do. let me just say as manager of the bill and as one charged with trying to hold together sufficient votes to pass this bill. I believe adoption of this amendment would really have a negative impact on the possibility of holding together a coalition of votes to pass a bill. It is often said that we should not allow the perfect to prevent the good. And while I am not in basic opposition to the amendment of my colleagues. I think it is wellintentioned. And if it were being voted on in the abstract. separate and apart from all other issues. standing as a freestanding bill. I would support the amendment of my colleagues. But I would simply say that I hope the amendment will be rejected because we all know that compromises have to be struck and in order to have an effective campaign finance bill pass we have to hold together sufficient votes to do that.

Let us not let some visions of the perfect prevent the implementation of the good.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Chairman. included in todays on bloc amendments is a provision I introduced. This amendment will take citizens who live near contaminated bases. put them at the table with base commanders. and help them participate in the base cleanup decisionmaking process. Thousands of military installations throughout the 50 States and the territories have environmentally contaminated sites. Too often. citizens who live near those facilities are not informed about the problem. do not trust the personnel in charge of cleanup. and fear for their health and wellbeing. The result. at best. is strained civilian/ military relations. At worst. we get costly lawsuits between the community and the military. The Department of Defense has taken steps to address this problem. It has established restoration advisory boards. or RABs: citizen advisory boards that advise base commanders on the communitys needs and concerns. This program was recommended by the Keystone Commission. which was formed during the Bush administration and was comprised of environmental advocates and Federal agencies. including DOD. However. the advisory boards now in place are missing a very important ingredient: technical assistance. What good does it do to bring citizens to the table if they are not informed on the issue: We cannot expect a homeowner near a base. for example. to understand complex environmental impact statements and advise base commanders accordingly. Therefore. my amendment does what EPA. DOD. and every other member of the commission recommended: it gives citizens technical assistance funding. With this amendment. we wont have just token representation * * * well have real participation. How is it funded? This amendment takes a fixed percentage of existing cleanup accountsonefourth of 1 percentand requires DOD to provide technical assistance for restoration advisory boards. Total spending does not increase. This amendment is supported by physicians for social responsibility. friends of the Earth. and the military toxics project. I worked closely with the Department of Defense in formulating this approach. along with Chairman DELLUNtS and Mr. SPENCE.

I rise in support of the en bloc amendment which Includes my amendment requiring a study on the costs. advantages. and disadvantages of using lowenriched uranium [LEU] to fuel naval reactors for current and future U.S. nuclear powered naval vessels. The study would be done jointly by the Department of Defense and Department of Energy. It is important for the future of U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy to eliminate all rationales for nonnuclear weapon states to acquire stockpiles of highly enriched uranium (HEU]. which can be used to make nuclear weapons. Aside from nuclear war heads. HEU is used for two purposes: to fuel naval propulsion reactors and to power re.earch reactors. The United States already has a wellestablished program. RERTR. for phasing out use of weaponsusable uranium In civil research and test reactors worldwide. To head off future use of HEU in foreign naval fuel cycles. such as in Brazil and India. it would be desirable to place the United States in the position of being able to phase out its own use of this material in naval reactors. The United States and the United Kingdom rely on HEU fuel for their naval reactors. but France and Russia do not. using less than 20 percent enriched fuel. Indicating that HEU is not an irreducible requirement for naval reactors. Weaponusable material in naval fuel cycles also represents a complicating factor for the safeguards regime needed to verify President Clintons proposed worldwide fissile material production cutoff for weapons. Under current arrangements for the NonProliferation Treaty. a country can withdraw material from safeguards for use in the naval fuel cycle. and the safeguards regime wont see it again for decades. The potential for diversion to weapons use in this scenario Is obvious. The success of the RERTR program indicates that conversion of naval reactors from HEU to LEU is highly feasible on a technical basis. This amendment requires DOE and DOD to assess how such conversion would affect U.S. naval strategy and nonproliferation policy. With this information. we can then determine the advisability of converting naval reactors to LEU.",

Mr. Chairman. my amendment would create a hiring preference for local residents who are affected by base closures in their communities. Under existing law. the Department of Defense is unable to provide preference to companies with a strong record of hiring local residents. or companies which seek to hire local residents most impacted by base closures. This is what people in my community are saying: Enough is enough. For years we have asked for jobs and contracts on projects that are funded with our tax dollars. we will no longer tolerate someone else. from outside our community. taking all the contracts and jobs. our demands are reasonable. peaceful and lawful. is anybody listening? The Congress has acted to emphasize the importance of revitalizing local communities in the area of a base closure by directing programs and resources to provide economic benefit to minimize the impact of base closures. Because of the way current contracts are structured. and because of the current bidding regulations governing Federal contract awards. there is no provision for bids to currently favor hiring locals most affected by a base closure. Instead. there are many reported situations where an outofState company. brings in outofState workers to do cleanup work at a base while unemployed workers stand outside the gate and watch. At Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in my district. over $30 million has been spent on environmental remediationwith not one local resident being hired. despite the presence of qualified workers in the vicinity. My amendment would change this by providing a preference in contract awards to companies which plan to hire local residents. It would encourage bidding companies to compete for having the best local hiring plan to score higher in the bid award process. Mr. Chairman.

October 16. the Capital District Union Label and Service Trades Council will honor Judy Conley with its Award of Merit. Ive known Judy for a long time. and I can think of few people who have contributed more to the welfare of labor in our district. She has worked tirelessly for the interests of labor. and whats more. she has been a reliable source of labor views ever since I entered Congress In 1979. And believe me. Mr. Speaker. Judy Conley has never been bashful about expressing those views. She has enough responsibilities for two people. Judy is field supervisor for the Upstate New York International Ladies Garment Workers Union. AFLCIO. president of the Greater Glens Falls Central Labor Council. AFLCIO. regional vice president of the Union Label and Service Trades Department of New York State. AFLCIO. and vice president oh the Capital District Union Label and Service Trades Council. AFLCIO. She was recently elected to serve as president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women of Northeast New York. Mr. Speaker. Judy Conley would not have acquired these duties without the trust and respect of her labor colleagues. She certainly has mine. And so. I would ask all members to join me. not only in congratulating Judy Conley for her award. but to echo my own thanks for all she has done to benefit working men and women in upstate New York.",

The 36th Congressional District of California is full of priceless memories from the wide variety of immigrant families who have lived. played. and worked in the area. For those who have not already seen the exhibition during its tour in California and Nevada. I urge them to take the time to visit this exhibit and learn about ItalianAmerican communities in San Pedro. Gilroy. and San Francisco. CA. Carbon County. UT. Pueblo. CO. and central and eastern Nevada. The treasures on display are everyday objects that were passed down in families. It is the memories that these objects hold that bring this exhibition to life and help us appreciate the contributions made by the ItalianAmerican community. I commend the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress. their 21 researchers. folklorists. and field workers. supporters including Henry Salvatori. the John Snow Memorial Trust. R.R.

In my radio address. I challenged the President to submit a legislative package implementing the NPR recommendations to Congress within 30 days. Nearly 5 weeks have passed since those recommendations were released. What has the administration to show for its efforts? Not a single bill has been introduced by the President. not a single monogram detailing their recommendations have been delivered to Congress. not a single vote has been cast in support of the National Performance Review. Only hollow promises stand now where Bill Clinton had once promised to make this issue one of his highest priorities. A unique opportunity has been lost to enact these reforms quickly. I hope that the White House did not use this costly reinventing Government exercise just as a political toolthat they really mean to support these ideas and make Government more efficient.

But I want to talk a minute on the issue of appropriations for public buildings. Mr. Chairman. the gentleman has done an excellent Job in this bill. But I have been concerned that the Federal Government has been too involved in the business of constructing new buildings and creating more office space in the cities and towns that are already glutted with vacant office space. It has come to my attention that we are building courthouses. post offices. and Federal buildings all over this country in communities that have a tremendous vacancy rate in commercial office space already. I am concerned that the Federal Government is creating these new office spaces. often in suburbs and outlying areas. when so many of our American cities are dying from lack of people and lack of businesses. while saddled with an overabundance of empty buildings and space and higher property taxes. The building boom of the 1980s is over. Past Congresses may have appropriated funds for unnecessary or unauthorized buildings. but we cannot do this anymore. The Government should try to use the space that is already there. that is already built and standIng vacant. It may be a nice thing for us to have an office building put in this bill. and maybe it will help a contractor out in our district. but it Is bad news for a community that is sitting with large amounts of vacant office space. I tried to address this problem earlier this Congress when I introduced a bill amending the Public Buildings Act to require Congress to consider vacancy rates in places where new buildings are proposed and prohibit building in those areas where vacancy rates are high unless there is a substantive savings to the American people. There are communities like Atlanta. GA. New York. and Chicago. where we are building Federal buildings. and there is a huge amount of vacant office space there. Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Chairman. this is. in fact. an amendment which I was also prepared to offer with regard to the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. Albeit a very valid purpose. and each of us I am sure have a desire to improve the relationship between Intergovernmental bodies. quite honestly the ACIRs work is duplicative of other organizations. universities. private groups. think tanks. the executive branch and. in fact. Congress itself. The very fact that we have created such a Commission and argued the need of such a Commission is indicative that we in fact are not performing our jobs in our own elected capacIty. It is our responsibility as elected officers of the people representing those people and those local Government bodies in this body. it is our responsibility. in fact. to be the gobetween. to. in fact. ensure that there are good governmental and intergovernmental relations. In fact. as we look since 1959. when this particular Commission was established. we can find that the relationships between the Federal Government and these State and local agencies has. in fact. deteriorated. We cannot find much of a contribution to better governmental relations through this Commission. and. in fact. as further evidence of its lack of accomplishment. there are currently 10 vacancies out of 25 positions on the commission. We have contacted most of the Members of the House and Senate who currently have seats on the Commission. most of whom do not attend meetings. The Federal Government should not continually fund and expand a program just for the sake of keeping it going. If we cannot cut a small commission that is undistinguished. and most Members do not even know it exists. then what can we cut? With an average of only 12 reports per year from this Commission. the cost of each report is exceedingly high. and none of their ideas have been particularly revolutionary or earthshaking. Most of their ideas are also ideas which have been presented and discussed in this body. I would submit. the duplicative Commission on Intergovernmental Relations has outlived its usefulness. and would respectfully submit we should withdraw the appropriation from funding this particular Commission.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. this amendment is really very straightforward. Currently. we provide former Presidents with a number of benefits including a special pension. Secret Service protection. support for the Presidential libraries and a lifetime personal office. This amendment is aimed at one small portion of those benefits--the personal office for former Presidents. The $2 million contained in this bill for such offices amounts to just 4.7 percent of all the Federal support we provide to former Presidents. Under the terms of our bipartisan amendment. these funds would be terminated 5 years after a President leaves office. All of our current living former Presidents would be given 5 years from October 1. 1993. before this benefit would be terminated. Last week the House overwhelmingly approved a similar amendment that terminated such funds for former Speakers of the House. None of us who are proposing this amendment believes that providing offices and staff to former Presidents is a bad thing. just as none of us believed that providing such support for former Speakers is a bad thing. This is not a case of waste. fraud. or abuse. This is not a case of porkbarrel spending. This is not a case of Federal spending run wild. This is simply a case of saying that the Federal budget deficit is forcing us to take a tough new look at all Federal spending. Lifetime funding for these offices is something we just cannot afford. This is a meaningful yet modest effort at controlling Federal spending. We request your support for the amendment. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

To those who are right now busying themselves with gutting our defense capabilities and turning the Armed Forces into a social laboratory. I say. look around the world. North Korea is but one of a list of states with an implacably hostile attitude toward the West. Our need for vigilance. backed by a firstrate military. remains undiminished.

On June 22. 1993. the President endorsed recommendations made by the Vest Panel. selecting a space station design which would reduce costs while preserving critical research goals and honoring International commitments. As part of this decision. NASA was directed to Implement personnel reductions and major management changes to cut costs. reduce bureaucracy. and Improve efficiency. The Committee on Science.

In addition. the House passed H.R. 2491. the VAHUDIA Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1994. which appropriates money for the redesigned space station and. consistent with the redesign cost cuts. reduces the funding available for personnel. To meet fiscal year 1994 funding. NASA Is required to reduce space station personnel by 1.100 to 1.300 civil service employees.

Manny cleaned up the grounds and removed graffiti from the walls of the Washington Park United Methodist Church. Mr. Speaker. I ask you and my colleagues to join me in saluting Eagle Scout Manny Medeiros. In turn. we must duly recognize the Boy Scouts of America for establishing the Eagle Scout Award and the strenuous criteria its aspirants must meet. This program has through its 84 years. honed and enhanced the leadership skills and commitment to public service of many outstanding Americans. two dozen of whom now serve in the House. It is my sincere belief that Manny Medeiros will continue his public service and in so doing will further distinguish himself and consequently better his community.

September 12. this House voted to spend 300 million tax dollars in unauthorized spending for 259 special grant projects that never was approved by the authorizing Committee of Jurisdiction. Many of these projects were rejected by the authorizing committee after careful consideration. Some were not considered at all. All of them were passed Monday night. on this floor. after being tacked on at the last minute by a conference committee. This is wrong. and precisely why the people of this country are so frustrated and so angry with the way Congress works. The House passed the original bill with zero dollars for porkbarrel projects. The Senate came into conference committee with $135 million worth of these types of projects. The compromise between zero on the House side and $135 million from the Senate was $290 million. And Monday night. as this was all going on. it became very clear to me how and why this is all happening. I heard the lobbying. and it went this way: You have to vote for this. because there is something in it for you. And so it goes. vote for this pork barrel bill of unauthorized spending. and even though it may be wrong. and even though It violates the very rules of this institution. theres something in it for you.

In passing this bill. the Congress clearly intended to protect endangered species. such as the orangutans. which are taken or kept in violation of any provisions of the ESA. as evidenced by 16 U.S.C. 1540(e)(4)(A). The forfeiture powers of the Department of the Interior should be exercised with regard to those orangutans which are currently In the possession of Bobby Berosini. a Las Vegas entertainer. who in 1989. was videotaped beating the animals on numerous occasions. Aside from this obvious form of harassment of these animals. which in itself is illegal under ESA provisions and would alone be grounds for seizing the animals. this individual no longer has any right to continue to maintain these animals. He was originally permitted to take these animals for the purpose of conducting a breeding program which he failed to do in 13 years. and .or which the Department of the Interior revoked his Captive Bred Wildlife permit.

The enclosed article by Mr. Alston Chase. which was printed In the September 16. 1994. Issue of the Washington Times. discusses one of the many efforts being made to deny sportsmen their hunting rights. Mr. Chases article describes a problem that was brought to my attention by a number of hunters. In sum. as the result of an outofcourt settlement of a lawsuit and the shifting of budget priorities. certain elements in the Clinton administration found a way to try and stop hunting In national wildlife refuges. This issue was addressed by the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee in a hearing on refuge management that was held in August. At that time. a number of Members of the House made clear their opposition to those animal protection shenanigans. I also joined with my colleague. JOHN DINGELL. in writing to the Fish and Wildlife Service and asking them to explain their actions. Ms. Mollie Beattie. the Director of the Service. responded by reaffirming her commitment to protecting sportsmens rights.

He then served at Brith Emeth before becoming senior rabbi at Congregation Am Shalom. During his rabbinical career. Rabbi Horowitz never stopped sharing his knowledge. insights. and questions of the Jewish faith. He taught at John Carroll University for 10 years. as well as serving as a scholar in Krakow. Poland.

The ad repeats a number of worn out lies but fails to mention the NRAs chief complaint with the crime bill. The fact is the NRA opposes the crime bill for one reason and one reason only: the assault weapons ban. The ban. which would take the weapons of war off our streets. is supported by over 80 percent of the American people. Maybe thats why the NRA doesnt mention its opposition to the ban in its ad. Let us be clear: the NRAs tough talk is a smokescreen designed to hide the truth: the NRA is soft on crime. The NRA is the criminals best friend. The NRA doesnt care about crime. or about victims. or about the safety of our families and our communities. The NRA does not care about passing a tough crime bill. The NRA cares only about stopping the assault weapons ban. Mr. Speaker. it is time to stop the NRA. Let us pass this tough crime bill. Let us pass the assault weapons ban.",

When General Xu arrived at the Pentagon. he got the red carpet treatment. He even got a welcoming band. Now. I know Secretary Perry is a good man. but it is incomprehensible why they would do this for the Butcher of Beijing. General Xu is secondincommand for the Peoples Liberation Army. He was deputy chief of staff in 1989 when the army gunned down thousands of students. He commands an army that sold weapons to Iraq prior to the gulf war that were used to kill American men and women. He commands an army that sells weapons to the dictatorship in Khartoum that kills black Christians. He commands an army that supports a brutal Communist dictatorship that tortures and beats Catholic bishops and priests and protestant missionaries. I do not think Secretary Perry was wrong for meeting with General Xu. but it is almost sick to think that he would give General Xu a red carpet treatment. It could have been a protocol mistake. but if it was intentional. then Secretary Perry owes a big apology to the families of all the ChineseAmericans who were killed in Tiananmen Square. an apology to the families of soldiers killed in Iraq. and apologies to the Chinese families who will hear on Voice of America today that Secretary Perry gave red carpet treatment to General Xu. who is the Butcher of Beijing.

People say. \"Well. if somebody stands in front of a door or accidentally bumps somebody going in while they are praying the rosary. they can be thrown into prison for a year and fined $100.000.\" Now those that bring up this type of argument know that is not going to happen. The same situation arose recently in my State in a frontier strike. Some picketers assaulted somebody trying to go in. They were convicted. These were union pickets. They were sent to jail and fined because they assaulted people. but they deliberately did it. They knew what they were doing when they did it. and they were repudiated by union leaders as well as others in the community. Mr. Chairman. nobody is going to go to Jail because they accidentally stand on the sidewalk. They are going to be cited if they deliberately interfere with somebodys rights. and I say to my colleagues. \"I firmly believe that. even if youre prolife. you should support this bill and vote for it to keep the violence down and to rid extremists from this situation.\"",

The prolife community which believes deeply in the right of life of all people. born and unborn. has repeatedly condemned the violence wrought by a few extremists. H.R. 796 seeks to address this growing problem of violence at abortion clinics throughout the country but in its zeal to protect those who seek or provide abortions. it violates the first amendment rights of those who wish to prayerfully offer an alternative to the violence of abortion. H.R. 796 makes no distinction between violent and nonviolent protest at abortion clinics. If offers severe penalties for a first offense. up to 1 year in Jail and up to $100.000 in fines. Should a grandmother praying the rosary on a public sidewalk be subject to the same harsh penalties as someone who sets fire to a clinic? I think not. Our country has a history of peaceful protest used by people of conscience who feel that their voice will not be clearly heard in any other way. The first amendment guarantees this right.

I. for example. have a right to worship in the synagogue of my choice. It says so right in the Constitution. Any of us can worship wherever we want.

It is time to meet violence against the unborn with violence against the murderers of the unborn. This kind of harassment cannot be tolerated. These clinics that have been threatened. bombed. or blockaded offer more than just abortion services. they offer crucial. sometimes lifesaving health care services to women. Many women. especially lowincome women. are dependent upon these clinics for prenatal care. treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. and cancer screening. Blocking women from obtaining health care is not simply an inconvenience. it is a crime. Finally. Mr. Chairman. to say that this bill denies first amendment rights is ludicrous.

This violence has been directed at both patients and providers. and has included the murder of a doctor in Florida and the wounding of another doctor in Kansas.

So the idea that the military has built a lot of facilities that are inappropriate is hardly the issue. The issue is how are we going to take care of the Presidio as we move forward. Mr. Chairman. I yield 11/2 minutes to the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. ABER-",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. in the context of the general discussion about the Presidio. some commentary has been made by a couple of the Members with respect to the DavisBacon Act. I am sure everyone is familiar with it. but nonetheless. let us just go over what is involved here and I hope we will not have this discussion because I think it will only prolong and interrupt what is otherwise a discussion well worth pursuing. The bills provisions with respect to the projects that are to be funded by the Presidio trust have in them the DavisBacon standards. All that is involved in the Presidio trust for Members who may not be totally familiar with the legislation is as a Government corporation. the Presidio Trust is subject to DavisBacon and the DavisBacon provisions simply establish the prevailing wage standards. Surely with all of the photos that we saw of the various projects including hospitals and everything else that is in the Presidio right now. we would want the prevailing wage stanidards to be in this legislation. It is consistent with dozens and dozens of national park projects that are federally financed and federally assisted construction projects. I do hope we will not get into a side discussion at this time about DavisBacon. I think that should be saved for LaborEducation Committee activity.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the chairman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman. this is a very important bill. The Presidio is one of our great national treasures. not just for the West Coast. not just California. It is unique. Its history goes back to 1776 when the first Spanish forts were established. and for the entire time since then it has been very involved in all of the wars that the United States has been involved in. It is so unique because it is an urban park in the midst of many millions of people. 5 million. 6 million. 7 million people. I know the people from my city of San Jose. some 30 or 40 miles south of San Francisco. on public transit can come and do come and join the 20 million tourists and visitors that visit this area every single year. as the gentlewoman from California . author of the bill pointed out. more visitors than the three great parks. Yosemite. Grand Canyon. and Yellowstone have visitors in 1 year. I think that is unique. They get there on public transportation from across the bay. Oakland. Alameda and all of the great East Bay people. children. and classes can come and do come. This must not be lost. This is the only way that it can be handled in an economical way with the Presidio trust. a system. a device that has been used successfully. It is by far the very best way to handle this challenge and promise of the Presidio. which as I said earlier. is not only a State and local treasure. but a great national treasure. So I would urge an overwhelming vote for this bill and congratulate my colleagues from California. Ms. PELOSI.",

We think of the east coast. you think of New York City. and you think of the great Federal Statue of Liberty which is a symbol to our country on the east coast. The Presidio. San Francisco. is the symbol to the Pacific rim. It began in 1776. It has been in military ownership. Yes. there are a lot of buildings there. and they are out of code. Military does not build buildings by going before boards of supervisors and city councils and getting building permits. They build it their own way. and when it comes to using them in an area that is prone to earthquakes. you have to rehab those buildings. It takes money. The best way to do that is to set up a management structure that will allow the loans to be repaid through the process of leasing and selling and managing those buildings. That is what this bill does. This is good management practices. It Is used in all smart activities by this Government and State governments. It would be absolutely ludicrous to defeat this bill. The best thing for the United States is to preserve this in public trust for public use under sound publicprivate management. I urge an \"aye\" vote.",

Because of concerns that operating and repairing the Presidio would drain money from the other national parks. even though millions of dollars would be transferred from the DOD budget to the Park Service. H.R. 3433 would establish a public benefit corporation to manage certain properties at the site to generate income to support park operations. H.R. 3433. Mr. Chairman. is supported by the National Parks and Conservation Association. the Sierra Club. the National Audubon Society. the Wilderness Society. the Friends of the Earth. the National Trust for Historic Preservation. the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers. the AFLCIO and several other national organizations.

I have received letter after letter from my constituents urging the House to ensure that the Presidio is transferred to the National Park Service in its entirety. and to pass H.R. 3433. The House recognized the national significance of the Presidio in 1972. when it passed Phil Burtons legislation specifying that -the Presidio would be transferred from the Department of Defense to the Department of Interior. The House must continue to recognize the significance of the Presidio. in 1994. by passing Congresswoman PELosIs bill today. In this time of base closures. Mr. Chairman. it is important that we support and encourage smooth transitions from military use to peacetime purposes. H.R. 3433 is a model for a smooth transition of the Presidio lands from military to peacetime purposes. In addition. H.R. 3433 will ensure that the Presidio is managed in a costeffective manner. This bill establishes a nonprofit government corporation. known as the Presidio Trust. which will reduce Federal operating costs by aggressively recruiting tenants that will pay fair market rent for Presidio space. This innovative approach will result in a valuable national park. to be enjoyed by future generations at a significantly reduced cost to the Federal Government. Mr. Chairman.

This act aims to protect. restore. and promote the South Carolina National Historic Corridora 200milelong. 13county swath in the western part of the State. running along the Savannah River Valley from the foothills of the Piedmont to North Augusta. at which point it follows the route of the old HamburgtoCharleston railroad all the way to Charleston. This act has several objectives. It would protect the significant land and water resources of the national heritage corridor. It would support. through financial and technical assistance. the State and local governments. as well as the private sector. in developing a management action plan for the corridor. And it would create a management framework to bring together the State and local governments to jointly develop policies and programs to conserve and enhance the cultural. natural. economic. recreational. and scenic resources of the corridor. Mr. President. the historic corridor concept has been used by a variety of public and private groups across the Nation to encourage historic and natu.ral preservation. and to promote tourism and economic revitalization. The approach has been used successfully in the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. in the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland. in the Lackawanna River Valley in Pennsylvania. and elsewhere. The heritage corridor concept offers a flexible way for government and private organizations to work together to promote economic growth and job creation. Mr. President. with industry concentrated in a limited number of urban areas. it is no secret that small. scenic towns and rural areas are looking to tourism as a means of strengthening and diversifying their declining economies. The heritage corridor concept offers an opportunity for many communities to work cooperatively and pool their resources in order to boost tourism. The South Carolina Heritage Corridor originated with a tourism committee in the city of Abbeville. and has grown to include 14 counties and over 40 towns and rural communities. This is a grassroots movement that has captured the imagination and enthusiasm of citizens across the western part of my State. The South Carolina Heritage Corridor is well conceived and holds tremendous promise for my State. I urge my colleagues support for this important bill. By Mr. BUMPERS:",

Senator LAUTENBERG. in cosponsoring legislation on an issue I feel very strongly aboutthe need for early and full adoption of the Uruguay round agreement on intellectual property rights. While these new rules generally represent a significant achievement and will be of major benefit to U.S. inventors and other holders intellectual property. there is one serious overall problem with the agreement that must be addressedthe long transition periods that are provided to developing countries. The legislation I am cosponsoring today offers one approach to addressing this problem by tying future GSP benefits to the extent to which a developing country has fully implemented key parts of this agreement. Infringement of U.S. intellectual property is no small matter. The Commerce Department has estimated that U.S. companies lose $50 billion every year from intellectual property piracy. Much of this piracy occurs in the developing world where there are often few. if any. rules protecting intellectual property rights. and little enforcement of such rules where they exist. Under the Uruguay round agreement. developing countries can wait up to 10 years before fully implementing the new TRIPS agreement. I think most of us would agree that this is unacceptable. Consequently. we must look at what steps we can take to accelerate this process of implementation. It is my intention to ensure that this problem is effectively addressed in the implementing legislation on the Uruguay round and I look forward to working with Senator LAUTENBERO and the rest of my colleagues on this very important matter.*",

Scott of Norwich. who has been selected by the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce as its 1994 Citizen of the year. Lottie Scott is a true American success story. Raised in rural South Carolina. her exposure to the evils of prejudice and segregation inspired her to change the world we live in. rather than cope with societal injustice. We. in Connecticut. are extremely fortunate that Lottie and her son followed her father and brother to Norwich in 1957. bringing with her that desire to make a difference. From the Werman Shoo Factory to the Wauregan Hotel and eventually on to the Norwich Iospital. Lottie created her own opportunities. Her promotions eventually led her to the Human Rights Commission. where she retired as regional manager in 1992. Perhaps even more impressive than Lottios success in the workplace was her devotion to selfimprovement through education. She managed to earn her associates degree from Mohegan Community College. as well as her bachelors degree from the University of Connecticut. all during her tenure with the Human Rights Commission. This commitment to excellence is a lesson in dedication from which we can all learn. Ms. Scotts career has been truly exceptional. but her contributions to the community. as well as her personal accomplishments have further enhanced eastern Connecticut. Her allegiance to the cause of civil rights prompted her to help found the Norwich Chapter of the NAACP and become a director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union. She also established her own consulting firm. dealing with affirmative action and civil rights legislation. Her deep concern for the city of Norwich has inspired her to create. as well as preside over. the Norwich Art Council. Such sincerity has carried over into her involvement with the Norwich Redevelopment Agency. the Connecticut Hospital Association. the Southeastern Connecticut YMCA. the Norwich Democratic Town Committee. and many other organizations. Mr. President. Lottie B. Scott is a Connecticut treasure. She has helped shape the social. cultural. and political agenda of an entire community. I thank my colleagues for letting me share with them this success story. The Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce could not have chosen a more worthy recipient for this years award.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in commemoration of the third annual National Worthy Wage Day. I would like to take this opportunity to make note of some important statistics gathered from a report titled \"Strategies for Enhancement of Compensation for Child Care Providers in Oregon. a Report on the Child Care Compensation Enhancement Project. State of Oregon. Employment Department. Child Care Division.\" The 1991 statistics show that fulltime child care teachers in Oregon earned from $9.500 to $11.880. Fulltime teaching assistants earned from S8.592 to $9.118. In center settings. the annual turnover in the same year was 52 percent for teachers and 81 percent for assistants. While the above mentioned statistics are particular to Oregon. they reflect wage levels throughout our country. Clearly. if wo are to have quality child care available to our very young children. the issue of adequate compensation to child care providers must be addressed. As an example of Oregons situation illustrates. the lack of a decent working wage for individuals in the child care profession has had a lasting effect. Information from \"Who Cares? Child Care Teachers and Quality of Care in America Final Report. National Child Care Staffing Study.\" a report by the Child Care Employed Project. Oakland. CA. indicates that nearly half of all child care providers leave their jobs each year for a different profession because of the lack of a living wage. Much attention has been given to the child care crisis in this country. Alliances formed by child care professionals. child welfare advocacy groups. and working parents have initiated broadranging discussions of the problems associated with child care. As dialog continues at local. State. and Federal levels. I am hopeful that the important issue of wage compensation for child care providers will receive the attention it deserves.0",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wanted to say a few words about the Senates confirmation of Ambassador Booth Gardner to be deputy trade representative last night. I consider this nomination to one of the most appropriate of the Clinton administration. Almost from his birth. Governor Gardner has played a major role in the economy of Washington State. serving our State in business through the Laird Norton Co. and Weyerhaeuser. and in public office. as Pierce County executive and. of course. as Governor. In his 8 years in that post. he had a number of interests and initiatives. but I doubt that few would rank as high as expanding international trade. In part because of his efforts. Washington State Is now more dependent that any other on international trade. Governor Gardner worked hard to strengthen our States relationship with our trading partners. and led many successful trade missions to the Pacific rim and other parts of the world. I am confident that experiencethe familiarity he gained with many heads of government. trade ministers and finance ministerswill be extremely useful in his new role. and will serve us well. Governor Gardner stepped down from public office In our State with a distinguished record. This position will serve not only as just .oward. but as opportunity for him to apply his learned skills abroad In the service of our country. I am glad that the Senate has confirmed Ambassador Gardner. and I am convinced he will serve us in a distinguished and highly successful manner..",

You know. ladies and gentlemen. it is a shame to see what has happened to the merchant marine in this country. Thirty years ago we had several thousand American flagships that could carry out the strategic interests and trade of our country. Today we do not have several thousand such ships. We have less than 400. Thirty years ago. just for example. the Peoples Republic of China. that Is Communist China. only had a handful of ships flying the flag of their country. Today they have three times more than we do. They deliver all of their our goods. which helps to create the $24 billion trade surplus they hold against this country. They deliver all of their goods on their own flagships and none of ours. That is terrible. Ladies and gentlemen. we were put into a situation back during Desert Storm where we were actually blackmailed by some of our allies who did not agree with our strategic interests in defending Kuwait. We cannot lot that happen again. If we had to go to war in two theaters today. we could not maintain the strategic military interest of the United States of America. That is disgusting. That is why we need not only this bill. but we need the Merchant Marine Committee substitute amendment as well. I strongly support both of them. I hope the House will agree and will pass both.",

Each committee of jurisdiction is provided with equal time during general debate. The only section to which amendments have boon restricted is title 11. the financing sectionand here we have an opportunity for a clear vote on two legitimate. but different. points of view. The base bill embodies the Ways and Means version. which involves three taxestonnnage fees. a passenger tax increase. and a new fuel taxto raise about 31 billion over 10 years. The merchant marine substitute would rely entirely on tonnage fees. and would raise $1.3 billion over 10 years. Under the rule. Members are provided with a clear choice between those two financing proposals. I am normally opposed to any restrictions on amendments. but the Committee on Rules is not aware of any other amendments to title I. Our merchant marine performs vital economic and national defense functions. yet we have let this service decline to the point where it is a mere shadow of what it needs to be. During the gulf war. we were forced to contract out to foreignflagged vessols--a precarious arrangement at best. Luckily the problems with foreignflagged shippers during this conflict were relatively minor. but there were conflicts. and there are no guarantees for the future. There are also nonwartime absurdities--such as renting cruise ships from the Ukrainians to be Haitian refugee processing centers. When the financing portion of H.R. 4003title IIis considered. I urge support of the merchant marine amendment. It represents a reasonable compromise between the original bill. which called for 31.7 billion in financing. and the 31 billion Ways and Means version. Supported by the bipartisan leadership of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. the substitute financing amendment is absolutely necessary to maintain the bare minimum of merchant marine service for our national interests.

Although entitled merchant marine legislation. indeed. today this House could be debating the same bill entitling it a National Security Act of 1994. or we could be calling it an Economic Security Act of 1994. because in truth. it is both. In a single generation. we have seen the United States fall from one of the worlds great maritime powers to indeed a nation unable to raise sufficient maritime forces to support our own troops in the field or to handle our own cargo in export. It is not simply a question of the nostalgia for an American power we used to have. It Is a real and dangerous loss of influencu and capability. more than in theory. In the Persian Gulf war. it is not simply. as the gentleman from New York suggested. that we were intimidated by some nations who did not want to help. We were threatened by some who would not help. American cargo arrived late for the Persian Gulf war. Merchant ships leased from other nations refused to enter the Persian Gulf under fire. American forces were without the support they needed at critical moments. Make no mistake about it. if in Korea the current conflict were to become an armed struggle. this Nation all by itself to defend our own interest is without the capability to bring the merchant forces to bear. And on the economic sphere. it is no different. A great economic power cannot be dependent for its own exports and its own imports to the tune of almost 70 percent of capability. cannot be dependent upon foreign flag carriers almost exclusively for some cargo on some routes. We need the competition. We need the domestic capability. After years of decline. an answer has finally been brought to this floor. For that. this body owes a considerable debt of gratitude to the gentleman from Massachusetts . I urge my colleagues. Democrats and Republicans alike. to take this stand. It will not bring us back the capability we once had. It will not give us the capability we need. But it will stop the continuing decline and the possible extinction of both our construction and our operating capabilities at this late date. I urge support of the rule and of the legislation.",

I rise in opposition to H.R. 4003. unfortunately for the same reasons that I have opposed cargo preference initiatives on this floor. because this bill. like its predecessors In the cargo prefernnce. will severely damage agricultural exports because it will raise their costs and make them less competitive in world markets. H.R. 4003. as modified by the Committee on Ways and Means. not only mandates a new uniform rate of 22 cents per net registered ton for all veseels. but also assesses an excise tax of 1 cent per gallon on all diesel fuel sold for use in commercial vessels departing the United States for foreign ports. These taxes particularly hurt agricultural farmers. but these taxes also hit bulk commodities particularly extra hard. Bulk commodities. such as grain. fertilizers. and coal are extremely pricesensitive in the present competitive world market. and a few cents a ton in price can make the difforence on whether a foreign purchaser decides to buy a U.S. commodity. It is also important to point out that increasing the tonnage tax will damage United States exports to Mexico. A significant amount of grain exports from the United States to Mexico. probably in the area of 50 percent. still move by ocean vessel as well. As a case in point. a typical gulf vesgel would make approximately 10 to 12 calls on a U.S. port per year. and would have a net registered tonnage of 11.000 tons. and carry approximately 25.000 tons of corn. Under the tax provisions in H.R. 4003. this moans an increase of $19.250 or 389 percent. In the final analysis. Mr. Speaker. farmers. grain elevators. and barge companies which use the river system to move grain to ocean export points will be hurt at the expense of questionable subsidies for the maritime industry. I ask Members to vote \"no\" both on H.R. 4003 and on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts .",

I hope Members listening to this debate understand one thing. We went from 1945 being the greatest maritime nation in the world. better than Britain which was the big one of all times until right now we are 16 in the total maritime fleets. We have 394 vessels left to ply the great seas of this world. 394 vessels. Panama has 3.040. Liberia has 1.550. China has 1.359. Cyprus has 1.210. and I can go on down the line.

We ought to be shipping our goods abroad on Americancrowed and Americanbuilt ships. and we ought to be bringing some of it into our shores as all other countries do today. and we do not. Last year we started building new ships. two new ships being built for the maritime industry. two being built. In 1979 at least we had about 89 ships being built. In a short period of time we have gone to very nearly zero. So I ask my colleagues to support the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee substitute. We are paying our share. It is in fact an ability to raise the money to pay for this program to the industry itself so that we can reinstate our greatness on the seas that we had in the past. If we do not do that today. we will never have the merchant marine fleet we should have for this great Nation.",

The agreement has not even been reduced to writing and ready for signature. It is not contemplated that anyone will sign it until after October. Even if signed in the form in which it has been negotiated. as discussed with me by the principal American negotiator. it protects the subsidies of other nations who have. and for some time and continue now.

For the American shipbuilding industry we ask only a very modest pittance for a transition program that would end before any agreement comes into effect which will permit American shipbuilders to be competitive in that international marketplace.",

He must earn 21 Merit Badges. 11 of which are required from areas such as citizenship in the community. citizenship in the Nation. citizenship in the world. safety. environmental science. and first aid. As he progresses through the Boy Scout ranks. a Scout must demonstrate participation in increasingly more responsible service projects. He must also demonstrate leadership skills by holding one or more specific youth leadership positions in his patrol and/or troop.

Don starred as the host of several local programs including the nationally syndicated rockandroll show \"Upbeat.\" Mr. Websters wide range of outside interests have found him engaging in everything from flying airplanes to sailing the Great Lakes. His favorite pastimes led him to pursue extensive training in meteorology. which ultimately helped him land an onair position as weathercaster for WEWS channel 5 from 1971 to 1982. While Don was forecasting the Cleveland area weather. he was busy hosting \"The Ohio Lottery Show\" and \"Academic Challenge\" as well. In addition. he found the time to create and cohost \"Live on Five.\" an early evening news program which aired for the first time in In 1984. the wellknown weatherman switched gears and became the executive assistant to the general manager for WEWS. and later assumed the position of station manager.

We must have partnerships. not only between different levels of government. but also with the private sector. The new Presidents Committee can be of assistance in fostering these partnerships. As chair of the committee having jurisdiction over the Arts and Humanities endowments. I hope the Presidents Committee will see itself as a resource. not only to the endowments but also to our committee as we begin the process of reauthorizing the NEA. the NEH. and the IMS. This may well be the most important reauthorization these agencies have ever undergone. There are many issues that have to be explored and many questions to be asked and answered regarding the direction of Federal support for the arts and humanities. Although the Presidents Committee has no official legislative authority or responsibility with respect to these agencies. Ill be looking to the committee for appropriate guidance and counsel as my committee reviews the NEA. the NEH and IMS. The new members to the Presidents Committee have years of wisdom. experience. and knowledge in the arts and humanities. and Ill be calling on them to share their thoughts and comments with me and my committee.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today Congressman TOM SAWYER and I are Introducing a joint resolution declaring November 1. 1994 as National Family Literacy Day. As we look to reforming our Nations schools. one fact has become evidentthere is a strong relationship between the literacy skills of a parent and the educational achievement of their children. Unfortunately. millions of Americans are trapped in a cycle of poverty. dependency. and undereducationand it impacts heavily on the ability of their children to do well In school. Family literacy programs open a door for such families. allowing them to work together to create a better future. Family literacy programs not only provide parents with the literacy skills they need to obtain employment and help their children with their homework. they provide children with the skills they need to start school ready to learnand to keep learning. Several years ago I introduced. and Congress enacted. the Even Start Program. a family literacy program which provides parents with education and job skills and their children with a quality preschool program. In addition. it provides parents with the skills they need to truly be their childs first and most important teacher. This program has been very successful. Family literacy programs such as Even Start can also increase parental involvement in education. They encourage parents to read to their children and to become active participants in their childs education. Secretary of Education. Richard Riley. in outlining his new parental involvement effort. cited an Even Start family literacy program as a good example of an effective parental involvement program. I encourage you to join Congressman SAWYER and I in paying tribute to family literacy programs by declaring November 1. 1994 as National Family Literacy Day. These programs play an important role in school reform. welfare reform. and can even play a role in a reduction in crime. They deserve our support.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join with the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee as an original cosponsor of this important consumer protection legislation. the Insurance Sales and Underwriting Consumer Protection Act of 1994. This legislation stands for a very simple principleanyone who sells or underwrites insurance in a State should comply with the insurance regulatory requirements of the State. specifically including the consumer protection requirements. While this is a simple principle which should be obvious to all. it is necessary to restate it as Federal law for two reasons. First. some inslitulions that sell or underwrite insurance have claimed they are above the law when it comes to soiling or underwriting insurance. These institutions claim that because they are not insurance companies. they dont have to comply with the same regulatory requirements that insurance companies or insurance agents have to comply with. This is unfair and leaves consumers without critical protections. Second. recent revelations regarding the deceptive sale ot life insurance products have indicated that some insurance companies also ignore these crucial State consumer protection requirements. While the legislation contemplates that States would continue to have the authority to enforce their own requirements. this Federal legislation would be a backstop it States fail to take action to protect consumers. I am not necessarily satislied that current State requirements are adequate to protect consumers. and this is an issue that Congress will continue to pursue. However. at a minimum. I think all should agree. those who sell or underwrite insurance should comply with the State requirements. This bill is an attempt to put this simple principle into law an. .mprove the protections for insurance consu. .rs. This legislatirn is supported by a broad coalition including insurance companies. insurance agents. and the Consumer Federation of America. and I urge my colleagues to support it.",

Mr. Chairman. this amendment to impact aid would expand the eligible children served under this title to include dependents of nonmilitary personnel employed on property under the jurisdiction of the uniformed services. These include children of vital personnel such as machinists. engineers. medical professionals. and other support staff that help to keep our military installations and personnel functioning at their peak capacity. These families are often as closely tied to Federal activity as military personnel. when bases close or personnel are transferred. these families are less able to contribute to the tax base of their communities. While they do contribute tax dollars from home ownership or other personal property. these revenues represent only part of the total educational budget of most local educational agencies. Employers generally contribute a significant share of the cost of educating their employees children. in the form of property taxes assessed by local governments. Where the Federal Government employs significant numbers of people. both military and civilian. we have an obligation to help defray the cost of educating their children. Impact aid funds have been provided to help defray these costs. but local governments cannot collect taxes from the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker. there are over 8.000 civilian category B children living in my district. and over 600.000 of these children nationwide. We have restored funding for some category B children in subcommittee with the inclusion of children living in lowrent housing and military dependents in the markup. Under the current proposal. however. the third district of Virginia stands to lose over $1.3 million dollars in funds for civilian category- B children. It is unfair to ask school districts to carry the weight of this burden. Let us show our support for our schools and our military by helping to ensure that dependents of civilian personnel have the same opportunities for a quality education as the children of our uniformed personnel.",

While there are a number of wealthy school districts that will not suffer from the deletion of a substantial part of their Federal impact aid money. this across the board cut of allowances for students of nonmilitary parents who work on Federal installations would deal a devastating blow to the budgets of financially strapped schools in my district and in others throughout the Nation. In my district 16 school districts receive impact aid funds. Three of these school systems currently receive approximately $630.000 in impact aid funds for civilian \"B\" students. One system is the 11 largest system in the State. but the lowest perstudent funding in the State. The loss of these federal funds will work real hardships on education in these schools. As the result of closures of other military facilities. the Naval aviation Depot In Cherry Point. in my district Is expected to employ another 1.100 civilian employees within the next year. causing a severe Federal Impact on the local school system In years to come. The compensatory funds provided for civilian \"B\" impact aid student are vital to the curricula of these schools. Mr. Chairman. if there are wealthy districts that use the civilian \"B\" category funds as gravy. then perhaps It is time to means test this program. It is unfair to cut funding that is desperately needed just to maintain the status quo in poorer. severely impacted districts. If there are justifiable cuts. they should be made on a districtbydistrict basis. but dont throw out the baby with the bathwater. The civilian \"Bs\" have been targeted year after year. and better sense has prevailed to restore them. It would be ironic if this administrationwith its ambitious educational goalsshould be the one to succeed in wrecking a program that has been successful and fair in North Carolina and has never suffered any taint of scandal or misuse.

We Just do not have the money. I recognize that education is very important. so important because it is the cause of violence. crime. health care problems. teen pregnancy. and it means so much. But the problem is we only have so much money. Last week we spent 2 days debating the balanced budget amendment. which unfortunately was defeated. We had a majority of the House that supported it. We want to get serious. I am on the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on Education and Labor. and I recognize the need for the money in education. But if you do not have the money. you do not have the money. We are talking about $150 billion if we use todays budget. We are spending approximately $30 billion now. To go to $150 billion under paygo. how do you get to that number? The other assumption that is made is that throwing money at education on the Federal level solves the problem. Education. in my opinion. belongs to the family. the State and local levels. it is not a Federal money issue. We Just cannot throw money.

Mr. Chairman. the point is that the gentlemans amendment. as I understand it. is trying to help local school children. but what he is really doing is empowering Federal officials to walk into our school districts. decide whether or not our local officials are correct when they make a decision over a childs personal decision regarding prayer. Federal officials can come in and decide whether that local officials decision about that personal time that a child may or may not want to spend with his or her God is the right decision. and. if a Federal official decides it is not right. they can strip that school of all their money. Finally. Mr. Chairman. I ask my colleagues in a thoughtful way to consider this: Wouldnt this amendment. as offered by my friend from Texas. risk dividing communities and encouraging costly litigation? You are a Federal school official. You wake up in the morning and what you really want to do is go administer the schools. or maybe even teach a couple of classes. But what you are faced with is a memo from the American Center for Law and Justice taking one side of the school prayer issue. and another memo on your desk from the American Civil Liberties Union or the National Education Association taking another side of the complex evolving school prayer issue. All you want to do is teach the children. But because the JohnsonDuncan amendment passed the Congress a few months earlier. you must now make a decision in this terribly complex and personal area as to how the children can best pray according to the Constitution. As soon as you make that decision. are you not going to divide the community of parents and children within that district? And are you not going to invite litigation? Absolutely. and every Member of this Chamber knows it. Let us not put that burden on our local school officials. Let us not put that burden on our teachers.

    "speech": "Madam President. I appreciate the comments by the distinguished Senator from California and I repeat my admiration to her for her work on this bill. I must. however. disagree with her comments about history. In the early days of the national parks. no national park was created until all inholdings had been acquired. The legislation was not brought to the floor of the Congress until such action had been taken. I am told a historic example of that. among othersshe referred to the east coastis the Everglades National Park was created after 100 percent of the inholdings had been acquired. That was the pattern in national parks historically through the 1920s and 1930s when the park system was growing. We changed the pattern as a Nation. In the 1950s and 1960s. the pattern was the national parks would be authorized and then in the authorizing language it would say. \"contingent upon acquiring all of the inholdings.\" So that the parks were authorized in advance of the acquisition. but it did not become effective until 100 percent of the inholdings had been acquired. If we are going to take the historical argument. Madam President. my amendment is in the historical pattern and it is the pattern we have followed in the last 15 or 20 years that violates this. My amendment goes back to the historical precedent that was set when the National Park Service was created. So. I thank the Senator from California for raising the issue of history but I call her attention to the comments in my minority views in the report from the committee that lists all of the national parks that historically were not acquired until the inholdings had. in fact. boen picked up by the Federal Government. I am in the proper. I believe. historical perspective of taking us to where we historically have been as a Nation rather than moving in a new direction. Madam President. I am happy to yield such time as he may require to the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee. Senator WALLOP.",

So I am just suggesting to the Senator that when you move an amendment like this on a bill that is definitely concentrated on this park. no other park. not a park in Utah. I understand. I still think it is important for us to note that there are other inholdings all across the country. including one in Utah and in California and other places. If it is good for one park. one might reach the conclusion that it might be the Senators intention to move for other parks if. in fact. he thinks it is good for this park.

There are too many deals in the Western parks where large corporate concessionaires have contracts that do not return a fair value to the Government. However. I am troubled that smaller concessionaires who have always given valuable services to the public and a fair return to the Government may be put at a disadvantage by this bill. I refer particularly to the changes in renewal rights for contracts. In North Carolina. several small companies have concessions at our two national seashores. They ferry visitors to Cape Lookout National Seashore. they provide ocean piers at Cape Hatteras National Seashore. and they offer overflights of the Outer Banks from the airstrip at the Wright Brothers National Historic Site. The bill today grants a preferential right of renewal to concessionaires with gross receipts of no greater than $500.000 annually. This will apply to several of the North Carolina concessionaires. Unfortunately. it will not apply to the operator of the Oregon Inlet Fishing Center at Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The annual gross receipts for this operation exceed the cutoff established in the bill. The Oregon Inlet Fishing Center is the base for a substantial fleet of recreational fishing vessels available to the public for fishing in the Atlantic Ocean and the adjoining coastal sounds. In a unique arrangement. the fishing captains and owners of the vessels have formed a corporation that in turn has the concession for operating the Fishing Center. Thus. while the entity holding the concession has revenues exceeding the bills cutoff. if we look at the situations of the individual boat captains and owners individually. I think they are deserving of a preferential right of renewal. They are local residents. many of them from families who have lived on the Outer Banks for generations. The Oregon Inlet Fishing Center and its operators have provided great service to the citizens of this country who visit the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. I believe that this concessionaire. and ones similar to it. should retain a preferential right of renewal. My amendment will ensure this. by establishing that concessionaires with annual gross receipts of up to $3 million have such a right.",

I am willing to look at the gentlemans concern insofar as this corporation or cooperative is unique and attempt to try to work with him. But to do it through this method would basically undercut fairness in the bill to the other concessionaires and to serving the park in terms of preferential right of renewal. We would basically be extending the preferential right of renewal.

They were often issued old equipment and fought in the coldest weather the West had to offer. with integrity. dignity. and commitment to this new country.

I wanted to follow up with Members of the House on the comments made by the gentleman from Michigan just a minute ago. and I have Just come from an agriculture hearing. a Committee on Agriculture hearing. and we today did a mock markup on GATT. which basically means that we voted on a lot of the substance of the GATT agreement. the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff. and this section was about that thick. 3 or 4 inches thick. and It only dealt with agriculture Issues. To my knowledge that was the first time the members of the committee had seen. not just that portion of the bill in Its entirely. but the related amendments. and yet I suppose we were supposed to be miracle readers. and could sit over there In 2 or 3 hours and debate while also reading the bill for the first time. Mr. Speaker. as my colleagues know. maybe trade agreements should go that way. but here we go on health care. and we have had the health care debate going. not just In the 103d Congress. but In previous Congresses. We have the RowlandBilllirakis bill. we have a McDermott bill. we have the Michel bill. we have the Clinton bill. We have some bills right now. as the gentleman said earlier. we should put a deadline on to debate and to vote on. Now I understand that there is a Democrat leadership bill that Is coming up. It is all done in secret. Nobody is in there. As my colleagues know. I know there is some good and bad in sunshine laws. but I think this is an example where we need a sunshine law. where we have such a tremendous issue that is being dealt with behind the doors. behind the scenes. and by one party which. I think. is offensive and outrageous. and the American people need to know that the major bill. the thing that we are not able to add and put on the table right now for review and study. is being crafted secretly in some back room.",

Bill Pearce began his career at Cargill In 1952. He helped build Cargill Into the countrys largest privately held business. one that buys. sells. transports. and processes grain. Because of his strong efforts for Cargill. Bill also successfully lobbied for U.S. agriculture policies to keep food prices low for consumers and export markets open for U.S. goods. Bill took a leave of absence from Cargill In the 1970s to serve as Assistant U.S. Trade Representative. During his tenure. he was highly successful in maneuvering a major trade bill through Congress that has set the stage for U.S. international trade policy for generations. Upon his return to Cargill. Bill Pearce performed a near impossible feat by fundamentally restructuring the company. As vice chairman of the board. Pearce pushed for a new board of directors. dealt with the desires of the many owners and Instituted an employee stock option plan [ESOP) that served to turn the company around. Mr. Speaker. for his efforts not only In the private sector. but also his strong influence on U.S. agricultural and trade policy. I highly commend Mr. Pearce for his efforts.

From the frozen fields of Valley Forge to the desert dunes of Kuwait. our Nations Armed Forces have served admirably. and from Arlington National Cemetery. just a stones throw from the Capitol. to the hundreds of Department of Veterans Affairs cemeteries scattered across the country. we honor those veterans. Unfortunately. veterans in the ChIcagoland area do not have the opportunity to be buried in a VA cemetery near their homes. To receive this honor. veterans must elect to be buried either In Milwaukee. or as much as 150 miles from their homes. Because of this hardship. the VA has made Chicago one of Its prioritles for a cemetery. but has been unable to actually produce a location. I believe those who call Chicago home and who have so gallantly served their country deserve better. As a result. I have Introduced legislation which would direct the Secretary of the Army to transfer as much as 200 acres of Fort Sheridan. which was closed as part of the 1988 base closure and realignment proceedIngs. to the Department of Veterans Affairs for use as a veterans cemetery.

We know we cannot go to conference today. We know this kills it. This is a bill that is long overdue. This is not something where we are talking about States that are taking money. This is not a handout. This is not an entitlement. This is because the Federal Government retains the ownership for more than 100 years of these lands and requires the countries to maintain basic services. This is a payment for those services. We have a responsibility as a Federal Government to pay our fair share. That is why this amendment should be defeated. and we should allow this indexing of the authorization. not the appropriation. not the appropriation. but only of the authorization.",

Some critics make the absurd claim that this legislation is an entitlement. PILT is not welfare. It is plain fair. This bill will increase the PILT formula to give local governments more fair compensation for the lost tax revenue caused by federally owned. taxexempt land like the Wayne National Forest in my poor southern Ohio district. S. 455 will increase payments in my district from just over $47.000 to more than $200.000 in 5 years. and local governments. including my schools. will be assured that their payments from Washington will keep up with inflation. Amendments that would cut PILT payments after 2 years or say that the Frontier Local School District and others do not deserve to keep up with inflation are just plain wrong. I urge my colleagues to reject the amendments and pass the bill to ensure fair compensation to our governments and our schools.",

I think it is evident to everybody here that if we do not act on this measure without amendment. it is dead. and we have one more time failed to keep faith with the communities across this country that have allowed Federal participation in their communities through Federal land ownership. We have not been keeping faith with them. Inflation has eroded the value of our payments. Communitiesoften small rural communities. counties. and citiesare suffering because we have been taking and not giving back. This is the essence of the whole fight we have had here on mandates. This is even in my view worse. because instead of not paying for something we have mandated. in this case we have taken the land and we have not compensated the communities that have it no longer on the tax rolls. We have an opportunity here to allow the authorization to move forward. but in no sense do we tell the subcommittee of the gentleman from Illinois what it must appropriate. So. for all the discussion about automatic increases. that is a red herring. The Committee on Appropriations will continue to struggle with whatever is required.

While it is understandable for advocates for payments in lieu of taxes to ask for an increase after an 18year freeze on the funding level for this worthwhile program. it is not reasonable In my judgment to ask that we automatically index this payment for future years. Indexing is what got us in trouble with so much of our Federal budget today. Automatic increases should not be expanded to cover additional programs regardless how valuable. We ought to analyze what the budget can afford and analyze what is fair in comparison to other priorities within the budget. An automatic increase should not be slated. Bear in mind. as well. this is not an entitlement program. this is a discretionary program. an annually appropriated program. which means an expected increase in this program each year would naturally come at the expense of other programs In the same part of the budget. Let us not put further pressure on the valuable programs. Let us be reasonable. take this more slowly. At the very least. we ought to deny a COLA as part of this legislation.

The bill would establish the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Corridor in Connecticut and a Commission within the Interior Department to assist with the management of the corridor. Most Importantly. the measure includes my legislation to expand the boundary of the Weir Farm National Historic Site. The National Park Service is authorized to acquire the last two remaining undeveloped parcels of the historic Weir Farm that remain in private ownership. This requires no additional funding authority or appropriations. Although these parcels were a part of the historic Weir Farm and were identified as such when the State of Connecticut and the trust for public land began acquiring the land that eventually became the Weir Farm National Historic Site. the Federal legislation that designated the site moved more quickly than the negotiations between the State and the trust for public land. Not wanting to include land from an owner who was unwilling to be included within the boundaries of a national park site. the sponsors of the authorizing legislation removed these parcels from the boundary maps. The legislation I introduced was prompted by an agreement between the owner of the land. the recent acquisition of the land by the trust for public land. and the expressed Interest by the National Park Service of acquiring the land. The funds to do so have been appropriated. so no new funding authority or appropriations would be required. Moving forward with this acquisition would preclude development of these last remaining privately owned undeveloped parcels. Because these parcels are directly in view of the most visited part of Weir Farm. their undeveloped state is necessary to preserve the aesthetic integrity of the site. This will preserve the landscape as it was in the late 19th and early 20th century when it was painted by thoseled by J. Alden Weirwho became known internationally as the American impressionists. The J. Alden Weir National Historic Site is the only site in the National Park System to commemorate an American painter and it is Connecticuts only national park. Mr. Speaker.

But the military scenario in laiti would not be very difficult. to say the least. but what would be difficult. and the Senator from Utah mentioned this a little while ago. is we would basically become law enforcement officials. We would basically have to provide the police function. and we would be doing it with military forces. As we have seen from difficulty in the Middle East and other places. that is a very lifficult job for the military. who have a different mission. They are not taught to arrest and detect and prosecute. They are taught to basically search and destroy. That is a different mission. So I hope that the military option is not required or necessary. But let us do not take it off the table. Let us do not take it away from the President as an option. Let us do not remove this psychological pressure that I hope will be successful in bringing about some resolution of the tragedy in Haiti. I yield to my friend.",

I want to come back to the underlying question here. putting aside the (lobate on Haiti for a minute. whether you agree or disagree with what is present policy. There is a more fundamental issue that is being addressed as a result of our colleague from New Hampshire raising this binding amendment. It goes far beyond the issue of this particular fact situation that I have been reading over the War Powers Resolution. and my colleague from Georgia is far better acquainted with this than I. And I so the arrival of our colleague from Virginia who is well acquainted with it. as well. There has been a 22year debate on the War Powers Resolution and the debate has not focused on whether or not the Congress has the authority to restrain a Presidents decision to initiate hostilities prior to congressional approval. The debate has been. one. whether or not he should have to consult with Congress before he engages in those activities and. second. whether. within 48 hours after engaging in those hostilities. he needs to come to the Congress and got some permission. And Presidents going back to President Nixon. if I am not incorrect. have strongly objected to even that restriction on executive power. Now. that is the question I guess I would ask. But that has been a significant debate. This amendment goes far beyond that. in that it is a precondition and sets a standard with which no other President has ever been asked to comply in any case specific or even in the generic situation. Is that the opinion of the Senator from Georgia. as well?",

JAMIE is retiring at the end of this Congress after a long and distinguished career. JAMIE is the current dean of the House and has served in the U.S. Congress since 1941. the longest tenure of any Member in the history of the House of Representatives. His service is replete with achievement. JAMIE cochaired the Joint Study Committee on Budget Control. which led to the enactment of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. That act was arguably the most significant change in the Federal budget process since the establishment of the modern budget procedure in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. JAMIE served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development from 1948 through 1992. interrupted only by the Republican control of the House from 1953 to 1955. He chaired the full Committee on Appropriations from 1979 through 1992. In that very important position. he presided over a great number of funding decisions that affected the Federal Government and the entire U.S. economy. JAMIEs service in the Congress spanned the period running from the beginning of World War II through the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. During his career. JAMIE has witnessed many historical events. including the Marshall plan. the start of the Peace Corps and other Great Society programs. and the 1990 Andrews Air Force Base budget agreement. JAMIE was an active participant in several of these landmark programs. JAMIE WHITTEN has served the First District of Mississippi and the House with honor and dignity for 53 years--and his record is one to be proud of. We wish JAMIE and his wife.

Even more importantly. he has served as a role model to me and many others in Congress. JAMIE WHITTEN is held in the highest esteem by all of his colleagues. Whether it was as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. where all spending bills are initiated. or representing. for over 50 years. the First District of Mississippi. he has protected all programs that are important to real people. Some say that as long as JAMIE WHITTEN is around. so too will the spirit of the New Deal. which will symbolize fairness and a better standard of living for generations to come. JAMIE recognizes that when you handle money. youre in the strongest position in Congress. However. \"The Chairman\" does not measure wealth in terms of money. but in terms of physical assets. Rarely in the spotlight. he labors hardest for the people from the Mississippi River east to the Alabama line. but has never forgotten the rest of the Nation. His record of accomplishment is unsurpassed. The standards he sets to ensure that our national assets are well taken care of. serve also as the yardstick by which we should all measure ourselves. Elected to the Mississippi house at the age of 21. he was chosen district attorney by the age of 23. Eight years later he would come to Washington to serve the people. JAMIE WHITTEN is quoted as saying. \"I came to the Congress by accident. my ambition was to practice law.\" Mr. Speaker. if he had practiced law it would have been to perfection. but if his coming to Congress was an accident. then we need more accidents.",

Pharmaceuticalgrade. FDAapproved egg yolk phospholipid and soybean oil are the two main components of Intralipid. a unique intravenous fat emulsion used as life support for sick or Injured hospital patients who cannot assimilate food through their digestive tracts. Intralipid is the main product of Kabi Pharmacla. a company located in Clayton. NC. More than 30 million units of Intralipid have been manufactured by Kabi In Clayton since 1979. However. it is my understanding that it would be impractical and uneconomic to manufacture Intralipids phospholpid and soybean oil components in the United States. instead. they must be imported from Kabis parent company In Sweden. Unfortunately. the conversion to the Harmonized Tariff Classification System In 1989 created a new category and Inadvertently tripled the duty on Kabis pharmaceuticalgrade phospholipid. The bill we are reintroducing today will restore this duty to its preHTS rate. We are also cognizant of the U.S. offer In the GATT negotiations to reduce the duty to zero on all pharmaceutical products. If this proposal were implemented. then the U.S. would impose duty on the pharmaceuticalgrade phospholipid and soybean oil components of Intralipidbut Intralipid could be imported into the United States dutyfree. This situation could lead to the manufacture of Intralipid in Sweden for export to the United States. and closure of Kabi in Clayton. Our bill would prevent this Inadvertent outcome by making the duty for Kabis pharmaceuticalgrade phospholipid and soybean oil zero if the U.S. proposal for all pharmaceutical products to be dutyfree Is adopted. Mr. Speaker. Kabi employs 175 people In Clayton and does about $35 million In annual business. generating about $90 million In annual economic activity for the region. Our reclassification legislation should be enacted as a matter of equity. but it will also remove the unintended jeopardy Kabi faces. We urge the enactment of this legislation.",

The legislation authorizes the release to the public relevant files and documents relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. As the former chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. I am aware of the continuing debate surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy and subsequent investigations of the snme. It is my hope that the release of files held by Government agencies and others will allow the American public to learn more about that fateful day In Dallas and the assassination of a great American President. Just recently. Professor G. Robert Blakey. who served as the Chief Counsel and Staff Director for the House Assassinations Committee. brought to my attention a series of articles which appeared in the Soviet Press Digest in August of 1992. The articles concern the KGB and its investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald as the assassin of President Kennedy. Mr. Speaker. I want to share these articles with my colleagues and others who have maintained an Interest In this important issue. (From Soviet Press Digest. Aug. 12. 19921",

Equally incomprehensible is the inability and refusal of Western leaders to effectively confront this holocaust. The failure to stop Serbian aggression and ethnic cleansing is not only morally wrong. but--if allowed to continuewill prove strategically disastrous. The OwenVance plan is no answer. Like the Munich Pact of 1939. it is unworkable and rewards aggression. It allows the world to pretend it is doing something while the slaughter of Innocent men. women. and children continues. Regretably. the Clinton administrations proposal would endanger American ground troops by having them enforce the OwenVance plan. The time has come for the United States to lead the NATO alliance and other regional powers in taking meaningful action against Serbian aggression. without risking American ground forces. Unless Serbia immediately desists. there must be fullscale air strikes directed at Serbias artillery positions around Sarajevo. all supply routes leading into Bosnia. and energy facilities and manufacturing installations in Belgrade. Immediate action must also be taken to provide the Bosnians with the arms necessary to defend themselves. It is only after a demonstration of American leadership and NATO unity that the Belgrade regime will begin to listen and there will be any hope of bringing a lasting peace to the Balkans.",

He expects upper income Americans--the ones who profited from large tax cuts during the 1980sto help with our economic recovery by paying higher taxes in the 1990s and he tells it straight to the rest of uswe will all have to contribute something.

    "speech": "amendment presents an alternative that prescribes fiscal and conventional responsibility for the Presidio. His amendment allocates $11 million for essential public safety and resource protection. This allocation is more than adequate for maintaining the Presidio. This project has been troubled from its inception. The National Park Service hopes to make the entire base into a park. including many resources that they have no experience managing. or even any need for. resources like a shopping mall. a pet cemetery. warehouses. hospitals. housing. a golf course. and a Burger King. The current Presidio plan demands that the NPS become a real estate agent and developer. Obviously. they are unsuited for such responsibilities. Furthermore. despite spending millions of dollars over the past few years. the NPS has yet to complete a final plan for the Presidio. Nor do they have an alternative plan. They really do not know what they are going to do. They want to enter into leases for Presidio properties. but have yet to sign a lease with any tenants. Despite this. the NPS maintains that the plans costs will be offset by tenant contributions. Congress cannot continue to fund projects that eat up muchneeded funds. The Federal Government must take measures toward reducing our national deficit. we must look very carefully at each and every federally funded program. for in these times of budgetary crisis. it is imperative that Congress reduce funding where we can. We must reduce. or eliminate. funding for programs that are not vital to the economic wellbeing of our country. We must turn our attention to more fiscally responsible matters. Again. Mr. DUNCANS amendment would not defend or eliminate the Presidio plan. It would simply reduce the amount appropriated. It would force the NPS to reevaluate its plan for a national park. I support the Duncan amendment because it presents a compromise that we can all live with. It maintains this natural resource. but it does so in the traditional manner. the horse is pulling the cart.

Mr. Chairman. the Smithsonian collects this kind of music. the Library of Congress collects this kind of music. It is not as if this music is going to be lost if we do not do that. Might be a nice thing to have. might be a nice thing to have in ones district. but is it something that is abso.lutely necessary in these tight budgetary times. and I think that is the question we have to be asking. In conclusion. Mr. Chairman. let me just say I wonder where we are going to stop on these interpretive centers. We are going to do this one for mountain music. There is a proposal to do a New Orleans jazz park. Is jazz going to disappear if we do not do the park? Are we going to do a rap park? Are we going to do a rock and roll park? Are we going to do a country music park? I mean where is it going to stop if we do this kind of thing? This goes beyond what the Park Service is obligated to do or what we charge them to do. and it takes funds. it takes resources. from the legitimate mission of the Park Service. and we have heard over and over this afternoon how short those resources are. The gentleman from Illinois has had to struggle with trying to fund these things. He knows how short those resources are. Mr. Chairman. I think I am out of time. I will stop at that point.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman. my remarks are going to deal with title I. not title II. I rise today to voice my opposition to the Bureau of Mines report language that is attached to this legislation. I am specifically rising to express my opposition to the current plan to reorganize the Bureau of Mines. On September 10. I and my colleagues wrote the chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior. the gentleman from Illinois a letter. which I would like to submit for the RECORD. In that correspondence. we point out four or five objections we had to the proposed reorganization. First of all. it. in our estimation diminishes to a large extent all mineral assessment work. mineral processing technology research and health and safety research conducted by the research centers of the Bureau of Mines. If this reorganization goes forward. almost all research performed by the Bureau of Mines will be of an environmental nature. I certainly do not have any objection to that type of work. but I do not believe that we should ignore the primary customer of the Bureau of Mines to date. and that is the mining industry. I also want to express. and we did in this. letter. our strong opposition to how this reorganization went about. It was under the Vice Presidents Reinventing Government plan. but part of his plan is to seek input from rank and file Bureau of Mines employees. And that was not done in this plan. It was a small group of executives that did this plan with the rank and file at the Bureau of Mines totally left out. And their input was not even sought. Third. and I would say that to my fellow Members from the South. 25 percent of the minilig in this Nation is done in the South. but under this proposed reorganization. there will not be a Bureau of the Mines office in the South. They will all be closed. There will be no research centers in the South. That is removing. in my mind. access to the Bureau of Mines to most Southern States. Mr. Chairman. that will conclude my remarks. I include for the RECORD this letter:",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman and my colleagues. we all know that arts education in America is important. My wife and I financially support the arts in our community. My wife sits on the board of a community arts organization that is having all types of fiscal problems. The question we have before us today is: What is the appropriate role of the Federal Government when it comes to funding arts in America? And I would argue that it is not within the scope of Washington. not within the scope of the Federal Government to be involved in funding arts activities around America. Second. I would point out at a time when our budget deficit is well over $200 billion. we should not be funding arts activities around this country and giving the bill to our kids and our grandkids. If you look at the history of this program. it happens to coincide with a period of time in which we have had budget deficits each and every year. So we are out there living high on the hog. funding all of these activities around the country. only to pass the bill on to our kids and our grandkids. It is not right. given the budget problems that we have before us today. to continue to involve ourselves in this type of activity. Again. I think it is important. But I think that Americans ought to rise up in their communities and support these activities financially as they do today. And so I would support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois and hope my colleagues will begin to realize that as we continue to have budget deficits. we have to say no somewhere. This is an area that is not within the scope of our responsibility. It is an easy place to say no.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill prepared by the administration to implement the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The protocol was signed by the United States in October of 1991 and was approved by the Senate in October 1992. The State Department had determined that the protocol is not sell executing and. therefore. requires legislation to ensure that all provisions of the protocol are applied to United States activities in Antarctica. The protocol establishes specific principles and rules for protection of the Antarctic environment from the effects of human activities. It deals with protection of fauna and flora. imposes strict limitations on discharge of pollutants. and requires environmental impact assessment of planned governmental and nongovernmental activities. The protocol also prohibits all activities relating to Antarctic mineral resources. including prospecting or development. but excluding scientific research. and provides that this prohibition cannot be amended by less than unanimous agreement of the treaty parties for at least 50 years. A particularly important aspect of the protocol is its reinforcement of the status of Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. This is entirely appropriate because Antarctica is a unique scientific laboratory of enormous value to the international comniunity. The vast Antarctic ice sheet interacts with oceanic and atmospheric circulation to modulate global climate. Accordingly. the behavior of the ocean/atmosphere system in Antarctica is expected to provide an early warning of climate change. The 2mile thick ice sheet covering the pole is also a repository of the past climate record of great benefit to climatologists in devising global climate models.",

A good friend of mine. Dr. Jim Arkins. who resides in my colleague TIM HUTCHINSONS Arkansas district. stopped running after 23 miles to administer emergency assistance.
