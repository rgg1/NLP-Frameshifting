Consequently. if the Members of Congress were foreclosed now. those who are not members of this committee or of the Foreign Relations Committee. I think we might find a revolt on our hands in the two Houses. which would tend to divide us. rather than unite us. I have no final conclusion on that. but that is at least one thought I have.

However. as the Senator from Oregon has pointed out. we now have an entirely different situation which grows out of the statement made by General MacArthur on the 19th of this month. almost 1 weekit was 6 daysafter the meeting on the 13th. and. in additionas has already been pointed out this morning. and the Senator has pointed out why he could not be presentthe two committees now have met.

    "speech": "Some minutes ago. and several pages back in the RECORD. the Senator from Connecticut implied that this was a minor matter and did not substantially affect the consumer. During the progress of the debate I have been searching for a reference which I should like to give from Fortune magazine. Fortune is not biased against resale price maintenance laws. Like other great national publications. it gets a major portion of its revenue from the manufacturers of trademarked. branded products. In January and April of 1949 Fortune magazine conducted a survey of prices on many items in the District of Columbia and comparable prices on identical articles in surrounding fairtrade territory. primarily Virginia and Maryland. On the basis of this and other surveys. Fortune conservatively estimated that fair tradeand that is a euphemism. it is really resale price maintenancewas costing the American public no less than threequarters of a billion dollars annually. Threequarters of a billion dollars is not something to be sneezed at or laughed at on the floor of the Senate. Another illustration I was trying to refer to before my good friends interrupted to interrogate me was a comparison in my own State of Illinois. We have a socalled fair trade retail price maintenance law. The State of Missouri on the opposite sde of the Mississippi River does not have such a law. There are twin citiesthe city of St. Louis. which is in Missouri. and the city of East St. Louis. which is in Illinois. The St. Louis StarTimes made a study of the prices of drugs and liquors in both those cities. It was found that the average prices on liquor were approximately 16 percent lower in St. Louis. Mo.. than in East St. Louis. Ill. The average prices on drug items were no less than 12 percent lower. We on the Illinois side of the Mississippi were held up for higher liquor prices and higher drug prices because of the law which we had. That statement is supported by a number of surveys. More important than the efforts of the drug industry to pass this bill are the efforts of the liquor industry. and these price comparisons help to explain why.",

The reason for it is that the markup on these items was so great originally that they could absorb the increase in cost without passing it on. It is characteristic of virtually all monopoly prices during the war. A very interesting article was written by Dr. Kenneth Galbraith. who was a leading official of OPA. which was published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1946 or 1947. In that article he showed that one reason why they had been able to restrain the increase in prices during the Second World War was because in the industries dominated by monopoly. quasimonopoly. or an oligopoly. or industries which are dominated by a few firms. the profit margins were large originally and cost increases had been absorbed. and they were able to control prices much better when there was an agreement between manufacturers than In the competitive market. However. that is proof not of good health. but of ill health. It is proof of July . an original highprofit margin. The opposite situation would hold true if we were to have a depression. The price of the branded commodities subject to resaleprice maintenance would not fall as rapidly as commodities in general. As a result. the profit margin would widen.",

As I said to the committee at that time. it might be very pleasant to the American people if we could eliminate all taxation. I do not think any objection would be raised. However. the Government must have revenue. consequently taxation is necessary. I hope that from now on we will be able to bring about the economy that the administration is trying to accomplish.

The Federal Government must of necessity raise huge tax sums to carry on the Government. The States on the other hand need money for their operating expenses. The municipalities are getting into fiscal troublemore of them each day. as time passes. Most of the big cities in this country today are approaching fiscal crises. And the little taxpayer. who is being hunted and hounded from all three sides. is most confused. He does not know where his tax dollars are going. and he does not and cannot keep track of how they are spent. One or two simple little illustrations. I am sure. will illustrate the problem. Let us take the case of the gasoline tax. A man walks into a gas station and buys a single gallon of gasoline for his car. That sale is taxed by the Federal Government. It is taxed by the State government. and then it is hit by the local governmentthe cities. which in some cases impose a levy by way of the sales tax. While the man is in the gas station. he buys a pack of cigarettes. We know that the Federal Government has an 8cent Federal tax on a pack of cigarettes. and many of the States tax another 8 cents for that pack of cigarettes.

I. Mr. LATHAM. The investigation will be carried on by the Committee on Ways land Means of the House. The thought lbehind this resolution is not to try to tell anybody which particular tax should be put on. and which should be taken off. This was recommended by the Hoover .Commission. a nonpartisan. nonpolitical expert group. and it was also recommended by the Conference of Governors. as well as the Council of Mayorsas I was saying. the thought is that by agreement. if possible. the Federal. State. and local governments should get together and separate the areas of taxation for each l3vel of government. It should be done and it must be done. You have. duplication. and you have waste. The Federal Government hires tax clerks and stenographers. and uses paper and makes records. and goes through all the red tape. and spends a lot of money to collect a given tax.

    "speech": "I will not use that much time. Mr. President. one of the arguments that has just been advanced for the defeat of my amendment is the importance of the provision toward assisting in building up that great livestock industry. I have as much respect for that fine industry as anyone on the floor. But I point out that the cattle industry. the one industry which has had the benefit of this capitalgains provision for the past several years. is the one meat industry of this country in which there Is the greatest shortage. Poultry and turkeys. which have not been contained in the provision prior to this time. are the only meat animals of the farm which are in supply. So surely it cannot be said that this capitalgains treatment for the livestock industry is so essential to them. otherwise. why are we so short of meat? I say this is nothing more than a taxsaving device for the cattle industry. If we are going to extend it to that group. we should extend it to every other group of farmers. whether they are producing chickens. corn. wheat. or anything else. I do not think it was ever intended to be that way in the first place. The argument has been made that the farmer buys his livestock. not for the purpose of selling it. but for the purpose of breeding. My experience with respect to livestock of any kind. cattle or poultry. is that it is bought with one purpose in mind. and that is to sell at a profit. The difference between extending the right of the farmer to sell his livestock under the capitalgains provision the same as applied to his truck is that when he buys a truck. he buys a fixed asset. The cost can be ascertained. His gain or loss. when he sells it. can be determined. On livestock it cannot be determined. because between the time he buys it and the time he sells it. the livestock has to be fed. and his investment grows over the period of years. and it is mathematically impossible to compute it. Actually he is still investing money in feeding the animal the day it is sold. Mr. President. I think the amendment should be agreed to.",

The farmers of Illinois may not have practices of which farmers in other States approve. But in most of the States of the Union the f armers do wholeheartedly embrace and approve of this program.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. all of the elements of our economy interested in a sound program for the conservation of our natural resources are disturbed over the rapid depletion of our natural gas. The supply of this fuel is not inexhaustible and if intelligent measures to establish a conservation program are not put into effect soon future generations will feel the effect of our presentday shortsightedness. Many of us who live near the natural gas fields are also concerned about the manner in which gas from these fields is being transported and stored in the depleted gas fields in other sections. If this practice continues. our existing fields will be exhausted without material benefit to those areas from which the gas is derived. Many of the great transmission companies appear to be overlooking their duty as a public utility in adequately meeting their responsibility and obligation to the States which make their construction and operation possible. In many cases this exhaustible natural resource is proposed to be used to generate power in sections that lie in the midst of unlimited coal supplies. Certainly this is a fallacious conservation policy. In an effort to focus attention upon this grave problem. I have introduced a bill to amend the Federal Natural Gas Act with respect to extensions of service. This proposed amendment would provide that the Federal Power Commission cannot approve of additional facilities without certification that the proposed new service can be rendered without impairment of the ability of the naturalgas company to satisfy existing and developing demands in the territory or territories which it is already obligated to serve. This is merely an extension of a fundamental American policy that public utilities must fully serve the need for which they are approved. It would in nowise impair the sound development of new markets for natural gas. and. at the same time. it would help to develop a more sound conservation policy for this great natural resource. I shall urge the Committee on Interstate Commerce to give prompt consideration to this bill. The petroleum supply of this country Is by no means inexhaustible. and. in this time of mobilization of our resources for defense. we should take full cognizance of the dangers involved in the wasteful exploitation of our natural gas.",

My view in that respect is no doubt colored by the fact that I have served since I have been in Congress as a member of the objectors committee on the Private Calendar. It is not a job that is designed. as I have said before on this floor. to make friends among the Members. An objector is in the unfortunate and unhappy position sometimes of throwing bills off the calendar which are the particular property. so to speak. of individual Members. During the years I have served on the objectors committee there have been scores. yes. hundreds. of private immigration bills that have been brought to the floor of this House. either from the old Immigration Committee on which I served. or from the now Subcommittee on Immigration of the Committee on the Judiciary. It has been one of the very difficult problems of the objectors to discriminate among this multitude of priate immigration bills to discern which are worthy and which are unworthy. Unfortunately. there have been few legislative standards by which we could judge the merits or demerits of private immigration bills. Indeed it has become a difficult task at times. If this bill is passedand I believe It will beit will virtually eliminate the filing of private immigration bills and their consideration on the floor of the House. This. Mr. Chairman. in my judgment. is a consummation devoutly to be wished. The historical analogy that comes to my mind in this respect is the analogy of the old private pension bill. That was a phenomenon that came after the Civil War. Many worthy veterans came to their Congressmen or Senators and asked that a private relief bill be passed for them. indigent and wounded veterans of. the great War Between the States. There were many. many private relief bills. pension bills passed in the decades following the Civil War. until there came a time when the whole pension problem was solved by a general pension law. That is an easily understood analogy to the private immigration bills. We have had these private immigration bills coming to this floor over a long period of time. This bill if passed will solve that problem. I think. 90 percent at least.",

As I indicated. in my opinion that would be the only way by which we could give a fair degree of justice. a modicum of justice. to those countries whose nationals wait for many. many years before they can get a quota number to enable them to come to this country. because quotas in many instances are mortgaged for years to come.",

As a matter of fact. the Post Office Department did apply for 4.525 trucks. but succeeded in getting only 1.185. What happened to the others I do not know. They were a type of truck not adapted to the postal service. but they were used. nevertheless. instead of buying new trucks. The statement was also made that the Department had refused to obtain surplus typewriters when they were being given away. The actual fact is that the Department applied to the Surplus Property Board to purchase 800 typewriters. They were not being given away. It cost $28 apiece to change the type.because they were of a special design for Army use. So they would cost $76 apiece. and at that time the Post Office Department was able to buy new typewriters at $76 apiece. Mr. President. it is very easy to make charges of that kind. but I want the RECORD to show that the Postmaster General has not been derelict in his duty in that regard.

We found the service would probably cost a million dollars. and we hoped the Department could get by with that amount. after the cut made by the House. The appropriation recommended by the Appropriations Committee is still under the budget estimate. According to our estimate. the appropriation would permit the Department to operate and make sure that the mails were carried. Members of the Senate know that the only mail which pays its way is firstclass mail. Efforts have been made to increase postal rates. but the bills never get out of committee. So what chance have we of rapping the Postmaster General and his staff over the knuckles with an arbitrary cut when we ourselves have not done the very job about which we complain?",

The committee believes that such provision would seriously interfere with the Commissions operations under the terms of existing contracts. However. the committee is of the opinion that the present undemocratic method of running the towns of Oak Ridge. Richland. and Los Alamos should be discontinued as soon as practicable. giving due consideration to the security safeguards that may be involved and to the successful functioning of the Commissions program. The committee agrees with the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that a definite timetable should be established for disengaging these towns from such community management and transportation contracts. Accordingly the committee. believing that it is essential to remove any basis for suit against the Commission. suggests to the Commission that as soon as practicable. but not later than 60 days after the enactment of this bill. the required notice be given of 6 months for cancellation of contracts for community management and transportation services. and in the meantime that they begin negotiations for substituting for the present system of corporate community management a new system of community management based upon traditional principles of local community selfgovernment. In other words. the Committee on Appropriations. of which the distinguished Senator from Tennessee is chairman. suggested to the Commission that not later than 60 days after the passage of the bill they should give notice that in 6 months. which would make a total of 8 months. the contracts would be terminated. Yet. now. almost 13 months later. it appears that Oak Ridge is still a corporate city. being managed by a corporation in the State of New York. Is that correct?",

First. some agencies. by their very nature. are not susceptible to decentralization. because their presence here is required by the Congress. required by the executive department. or required by the presence here of the diplomatic corps from the nations which are friendly to us. or for other good reasons. From the very nature of things. there are numerous agencies which are not susceptible to decentralization. My second pointand I wish I might have the ear of the Senator from Wisconsin as I try to answer his questionwith reference to decentralization is this: I remind him that decentralization has been under way a long. long time. and that we fully agree with him that we must make more progress speedily. But as a matter of fact of the more than 2.000.000 civilian employees of the Federal Government only slightly over 200.000 are in Washington and its environs. So that between 85 and 90 percent of the total of the civilian employees of the Nation. either deliberately or because of the kind of employment in which they are engaged have already been decentralized to other parts of the Nation.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in connection with the decentralization objectives. it seems to me it is wise to consider the legislative situation. The Bureau of the Budget submitted a request for $20.000.000 for financing a program of decentralization of 19.000 positions covering the period to June 30. 1952. That was submitted to the House Appropriations Committee. In the report of the House Appropriations Committee. dated April 6. 1951. on the third supplemental appropriation bill. the committee made these statements: The committee has disallowed the budget request of $20.000.000 for financing the program of 19.000 positions covering the period to June 30. 1952. The proposal was presented as a means of helping to relieve the serious space problem existing in the Dis. trict of Columbia and adjacent area due to the expanding defense program. Then the committee says: The question of decentralization. as well as dispersal. is now pending before the appropriate legislative committees of the Congress. It is the opinion of the committeeAnd this is the particular sentence I think the Senate should noteIt is the opinion of the committeeThat is the House Appropriations Committeethat an appropriation should not be providedThat is. for decentralizationuntil an overall plan has been considered and basic legislation providing for a comprehensive program is enacted. In other words. the decentralization which everyone desires is stalled at the present time by the failure to have any funds to carry it out. and the House Appropriations Committee says that the reason they do not provide the funds is that they think decentralization and dispersal are related problems. and that there should be a comprehensive program dealing with them. that the matter of decentralization as well as dispersal is now pending before the appropriate legislative committees of the Congress. and that until they have presented a program. an overall plan. the money will not be available for decentralization. In other words. what we are here doing is seeking to present to the Congress. so far as the committee could agree on it. a comprehensive program which comprehends decentralization. and we try to spell it out by providing for the transfer of not less than 25.000 positions in the Federal Government that must be made. and at the same time taking care of the related things. which would make it a comprehensive program by meeting a situation which is caused by the mere presence of great numbers of people.",

The committee considered the possibility of writing into the bill a directive which would place in the hands of the Bureau of the Budget a personnel ceiling for the various agencies of the Government. However. it was suggested that the committee did not have the necessary jurisdiction. and that it would be appropriate for the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service or the Committee on Appropriations to consider that subject.

The Battle bill provides for a certain amount of flexibility when t can be demonstrated that such flexibility is to the security advantage of the United States. For example. in the case of Austria. we know that some strategic goods under Soviet control in the Soviet zone of Austria are moving to the Soviet bloc. Nonetheless. it is certainly in the security interests of the United States to continue aid to Austria. There are reveral examples of this sort which make it almost necessary that the administrator of security controls be given enough flexibility to insure that the best interests of the United States security are maintained. We were given various illustrations of this on the recent trip to Europe of a subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate. Another illustration which I may introduce here is that of the trade between West Berlin and East Berlin. Under the provisions of the Kern bill. that trade would be practically entirely cut off. whereas the life of West Berlin depends on trade with East Berlin. or else it would become entirely dependent on air carriage from the west. Finally. the Kern bill makes no provision for administrative improvement in security trade controls. At the present time the Departments of Defense. Commerce. State. and the Economic Cooperation Administration all have important functions in eastwest trade controls. As a result. nobody Is really responsible for the policy and implementation of this important security job. At the present time. it is impossible for Congress to level its criticism at any one man or any one agency because of the separation of responsibility. The Battle bill has remedied this highly undesirable situation by putting the responsibility under one man. whose appointment shall be confirmed by the Senate. This man is to be responsible for the policy and administration of a program of security confrols worked out mutually with foreignaid recipients. The Battle bill is a step forward in protecting the security interests of the United States. while the Kem bill is a long step backward which would threaten our security and probably cut the ground from under General Eisenhower. and the whole mutual security program.",

FRANK FELLOWS was not what would be called a starryeyed idealist. His feet were on the ground. Yet h6 had a sense of practical humanitarianism which. prompted him to sponsor such legislation and to carry it through effectively: Those who served with him will long. remember his ability and his friendly personality.

He was a very friendly. lovable. and personable character. On my election to the Senate. our associations again became rather close. because we lived at the same hotel. On many occasions I had had the opportunity to visit with him in the lobby. and to ride back and forth from the hotel to the Capitol with him. We were associated on very many occasions. The announcement of his death was a shock to me. We can ill afford as a nation to lose men of the ability. the knowledge. and the character of FRANK FELLOWS in this most trying hour of our Nations history. I extend to his family my sincerest and deepest sympathy. I say again that our Nation has lost a great citizen and a great legislator. The State of Maine has certainly lost a most conscientious and able Representative.",

Although existing law penalizes the solicitation or acceptance of any money or thing of value in exchange for the proffer of support or influence in behalf of an applicant for Federal employment. it is doubtful whether this statutory provision has application to the normal activities of private employment agencies. The Civil Service Commission has long sought such legislation as embodied in this bill. The other body. in passing the bill. added a number of minor amendments perfecting the language of the bill. Amendment No. 3. substituting \"employment\" for \"any appointive office or place\" is designed to provide a shorter and more descriptive term for a synonymous but ambiguous expression. Amendment No. 5. striking \"or independent establishment\" from its context. is justified because the term \"agency\" embraces independent establishments. Amendment No. 9 creates an exemption to the prohibitions of the bill in cases where jobs are filled by Private employment agencies upon the written request of the Government agency concerned. The House is of the opinion that frequently Government agencies need and request the expert assistance of private employment agencies to provide candidates for positions where the normal Government channels have failed to meet requirements. The Senate Judiciary Committee has not obtained any evidence or received any telling arguments why the House amendments should not be adopted. Therefore. Mr. President.

There are already about nine other groups in the Military Establishment the members of which get this hazard pay so by allowing it to these Korea war fighters. it will bring them more in line with fair justice. Nor. is any difference to exist between officers and men as to this $45. That is right and sound. I am informed that to earn it the soldier or sailor or Air Force member or marine will have to have been in actual combat conditions for at least 6 days out of the month. He will have to have been under actual fire conditions and in direct contact with enemy fire. and subjected to it. This sum is little enough. I am also informed that most of such hazard pay will go to the men in the infantry. the men who fight on ground. Inch by inch. fox hole to fox hole. This fighting is where over 75 percent of the casualties occur. I am informed. As a member of the Committee on Armed Services of this House. I am very happy this provision is here and now. before we adjourn. Furthermore. the Armed Services Committee should promptly study uhe whole field of hazard pay and advise this House its findings.

There I saw the cream of our American youth in action against a Godless. ruthless enemy whose buildup during the truce talks has far outstripped our own. There are times when our fighting men in Korea wonder if the folks back home realize the awfulness of their assignment and it makes me sick at heart when I read of our failures in production of the weapons in which they are deficient. when I hear of the difficulties being experienced by the Red Cross in getting needed blood donations. and when I review the general apathy on the home front. Those in the midst of the fighting in Korea do not like the fact their Government still talks in terms of a police action even though our casualties have passed the 100.000 mark and we are in the third year of struggle. They have a right. too. to charge their Congress with being remiss. it was net until this very day that we approved the GI bill of rights for Korean veterans. And now we debate the matter of combat duty pay. The record will show that there are nine different categories of men in the armed services listed for higher pay than is received by others of their rank without extending the same consideration to those who are actually fighting. In other words. socalled hazard pay is not being paid to those now fighting in the foxholes and rice paddies of Korea. It is a discrimination that just doesnt make sense. It will be recalled that in World War II extra pay was provided for men in combat and I am certain that overwhelming approval of this bill now will serve a tremendous morale service to those who cannot help but wonder at times how much they are being backed by those at home.",

They said that no representative of the United States Government in any international organization after fiscal year 1953 shall make any commitment requiring the appropriation of funds for contribution by the United States in excess of 33%V percent of the budget. et cetera. The language written in by the House applied to this particular appropriation. This is the fourth time that the House has insisted that we limit our contributions to these international organizations to 331/3 percent. Just a week ago the House voted to liimt our contributions under the mutual security bill to 33 /3 percent. Yet we are again faced with the proposition of yielding on a matter that we have four times endorsed. The language which the Senate wrote into this bill provides that our representatives cannot make commitments after the fiscal year 1953. What does that mean? It means that in 1953 they will be making commitments for 1954. It means we will be unable to limit to onethird our contributions to these United Nations organizations until after This means that in our appropriations for these international organizations it will be 1955 before we can cut them down to 33 /3 percent as this House has already voted four times and is getting ready to vote the fifth time today.",

Of course. the Senator from Wyoming knows that for 4 years I had the honor of serving as chief executive of my State. During that period. in presiding over several of the State boards which have to do with matters of this kind. I was amazed at the multifarious problems in this field which come to Tallahassee for decision or to the legislature for special action. Although a few of these matters do have to reach Washington. they are few indeed. For instance. in the case of the groins to which I have referred. certainly not by the remotest stretch of the imagination could anyone say that navigation is hurt by the building of those groins. No one could say by any stretch of the imagination that navigation is hurt by the extension for a few hundred feet of the shore line into shallow waters. Originally Miami Beach was just a little strip of sand and mangroves. but now. as the Senator from Wyoming can see by looking at this photograph. the city of Miami Beach comprises a sizable area. because it has been built up both into the bay and into the ocean. At this time we are dealing with the growth into the ocean. Permits would not have to be secured from the Federal Government in regard to most of that growth.

That is all that has been done so far. It will be helpful in the consideration of the problem by the Joint International Commission. All we are asking for on Friday with the International Joint Commission is a chance to present the problem. which we heretofore have not had an opportunity to do.",

It is true of those of my colleagues with whom I have talked about the matter that. unfortunately. much of the mail received from home during the past year has indicated that there is doubt and great suspicion in the hearts and minds of thousands and thousands of people. It is true that the attack of the junior Senator from Wisconsin has been very effective politically. but it has been very unfortunate morally. and in terms of the preservation of free institutions. I have no doubt that politically. speaking in terms of elections. it has been a powerful and perhaps successful attack. but I think what is more important to keep in mind is not whether this kind of attack is successful politically. but what it means in the long run. for the solvency. the security. and the stability of free political. economic. and cultural insti* tutions. Unfortunately. it seems to me. there is today a psychosis of fear in our Nation. at a time when our people should be imaginative and creative. at a time when we should have people in Government who are trying to think out new answers to meet new problems.

The junior Senator from Connecticut . on the floor of the Senate a few days ago. very courageously pointed out the fact that the junior Senator from Wisconsin had been appointed a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of appropriations for the State Department. and that there could be no question with regard to his bias against the State Department. Hundreds of utterances by the Senator from Wisconsin have given clear evidence of this. He should not have been appointed to the Appropriations Subcommittee dealing with funds for the State Department. Yet. even after that clear and courageous statement by the Senator from Connecticut. very few newspapers in this country made any substantial mention of the speech. or of the issue involved. In my opinion it was a very great moral issue. a very great issue of good government. The newspapers simply permitted the issue to die without any substantial reference to it. It seems to me that this circumstance bears out just what the Senator from Minnesota said a few minutes ago. that there is hysteria. that there is panic. that there is fear on the part of people that if they raise their voices in any way in defense of those who may be accused irresponsibly. they will be accused of being \"soft\" toward communism.",

By a Senate committee amendment we go back to the kind of administration which is provided for in subsection (e) of section 406 of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949. On page 12 of House bill 5113. section 501 provides for the organization and administration of the Mutual Security Administration. In the mutualaid bill. the House attempts to set up four or five different administrationsthe military to handle expenditures for defense. I presume the Department of Commerce. although I am not certain. and certainly the Secretary of State enters into it. Then there is provision for a Mutual Security Administrator. to be appointed by the President. with the advice and cznsent of the Snate. and who shall be responsible to the President. Then what does the Senate committee do? The Senate committee strikes out all the suggested House language and once again it puts the administration squarely in the hands of the President. Section 501 (b). on page 55 of the committee print. reads: For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section the President is authorized to utilize the positions created in subsection 406 (e) of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949. as amended. . That is exactly the way it is being administered now. So the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has amended the Battle bill to do away with the suggested administration. and has put it right back to where it is now. namely. in the Department of State. The Senate committee has amended the mutual defense bill to do the same thing. So I cannot expect in the future any different interpretation of any provision of legislation which we write than what has been announced in the past by the Secretary of State.

Mr. Speaker. this resolution simply makes in order the consideration of the bill making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1952. and for other purposes. and waiving points of order. Mr. Speaker. the best I could get from the hearings on the application for the rule is that three questions are raised so far as the waiving of points of order is concerned. On page 38 of the appropriation bill. section 1309. certain restrictions. or prohibitions rather. are made upon the payment of retirement funds to certain defense officers who have retired from the service and are engaged in selling their services to others who engage in contractual relations with the Government. which. I think. is a very laudable provision. Then. there are two other points involved. On page 41. section 1312. is a section which ordinarily would be subject to point of order. It provides in substance that certain personnel and appropriations of funds available for salaries and expenses to any department or agency may be transferred all in the interest. it would appear. of economy. The third section which would be subject to a possible. point of order is section 1313 on page 42. That section provides in substance for the Army engineers to bring up to date reports on river and harbor and floodcontrol projects that have been made upon authorizations theretofore made. The Committee on Appropriations seeks this action. it says. so that it might have the benefit of the thenexisting conditions at the time the appropriation is asked for. I understand there is some opposition to this section of the bill. possibly coming from the Committee on Public Works. and that that will be debated during the consideration of the bill. I am inclined to the thought that this section should be clarifled in the ensuing debate. Mr. Speaker. I yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. BROWNJ.",

Mr. Speaker. the gentleman from Mississippi has made a very splendid explanation of the rule and the reason why the rule to waive points of order on this supplemental appropriation bill has been granted and should be adopted. I agree with the committee that these three sectionssections 1310. 1311. and 1312are of such importance that certainly the House should be permitted to pass upon the questions involved in these sections. rather than to have them subject to a point of rder where the objection of one individual Member may prevent their consideration. However. Mr. Speaker. this bill contains a great many other sections and items which I would like to speak about because of their importance. Mr. Speaker. I would like to have the attention of the House. I realize fully that the way we have been appropriating so much money in the last week or so. that a little item of $1.677.000.000 may not be worth the attention of some Members of the House. but I would like to have the attention of those interested in economy for just a minute or two. if I may. This bill carries a total of $1.677.566.316 in supplemental appropriations. That huge sum is in addition to the appropriations which have already been voted by this House for the different agencies of Government as contained in the regular departmental appropriation bills. Some of the appropriation items contained in this supplemental bill look a little high to me. so I would like to make an Inquiry or two. if I may. from some of the members of the subcommittee about a few of these items. if they will be so kind as to explain. For instance. I note there has been added a million dollars in the appropriation for the Federal Communications Commission.

I am willing to allow more time before I ask for a unanimous consent agreement. but if we can limit debate we will expedite the consideration of the resolution. and I think it is important that we do so. Let me say to my good friend from Minnesota [Mr. THYEI that I meant no offense in what I said. I hope we may proceed to the consideration of this proposed legislation very rapidly. and I hope we can have a limitation on debate.",

I think the RECORD should show at this time that there is no oil within the States of a great many Senators who are supporting S. 940. or within the socalled submerged lands adjoining their States. Therefore. those Senators are not particularly concerned with the oil question. But they are very definitely and actively concerned with the idea of turning over to a Federal bureaucracy the question of deciding whether we shall build a pier. whether we shall take shells from the bottom of our offshore lands. whether we shall take sponges. or whether several hundred hotels and other expensive structures which have been built at various places upon filled land extending into the open Atlantic or open Gulf are going to have their titles affected or clouded by having untimely. unfair. and unwise legislation passed by the Congress of the United States. Mr. President. I merely wished to make it crystal clear at this time that I expect. and I think it is a reasonable expectation. to have a courteous hearing. a hearing at which there will be sufficient time to make clear the tremendous values which lie within the whole question at issue. and which have nothing at all to do with oil.

I should like to correct the erroneous statement made here that the bill which will be offered by some Senators as a substitute for the pending bill. would give away all title to the Continental Shelf. I believe we should understand that the House bill provides that lands within the original boundaries of certain States should belong to those States. I have made some study of this matter. and have found that that would amount to 4 percent of the submerged land which would be subject to the paramount power of the Federal Government. It was further suggested in the proposed legislation that as to lands in the sea beyond that point. the States should have a 37 /2 percent interest in mineral royalties. just as inland States have received a 37 / percent royalty interest in the Federal lands within the jurisdiction of those States. It seems to me that we should stop misleading the public about this question. So far as I can determine with respect to the matter in my State. the Federal Government would continue to receive the lions share of revenue from oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. even if the House bill were passed. So I think it is time we stopped misleading the public into thinking that all the revenue derived from submerged lands would be turned over to the Federal Government. As a matter of fact. twothirds of the submerged land belonging to the United States is located around Alaska. Nobody thought of mentioning that when the matter of submerged lands was first discussed. As a matter of fact. after the discovery of oil and gas in the submerged lands along the shores of California. some Federal advocates were so anxious to get that oil that they refused to think of the other factors involved. So. Mr. President. I think we should not lose sight of the fact that the Federal Government would retain control over more than 90 percent of submerged lands. even if the socalled quitclaim bills were passed.",

    "speech": "Yes. I heard the Senator refer to that point two or three times in the course of his remarks today. but it has nothing to do with the Battle Act. The Battle Act was passed for the purpose of stopping trade in goods which we did not want sold. I noticed that the Senator from Missouri in his statement talked about the amount of trade with the countries of Western Europe. The Senator will remember that different listings were permitted to be made under the Battle Act. It is entirely possible that some trade has gone on. We have recognized the necessity for the trade. For instance. there was the case of the difficulty of trade between Denmark and Poland. That example could be multiplied dozens of times. Denmark wanted coal. it had to have coal. We cut them off from selling their products in this country under section 104 of the Defense Production Act. They could not get coal here because they could not sell their products and get dollars with which to buy coal. They could buy coal in Poland. and they could buy it with soft currency. but Poland in return required that they trade with her. If the Senator from Missouri were to follow his argument to the logical conclusion. Denmark would be forced from the western orbit into the eastern orbit. in order to find a living for her people. That is the logical conclusion to which this type of legislation would lead. if pushed to the extreme to which the Senator from Missouri apparently would push it.",

The eighth provision agreed on today relates to the termination payments to employees. It will be recalled that a provision in the bill gave capital gains treatment to lumpsum payments received at retirement upon the release of rights to future profits of the employer. where an employee had been employed for over a 20year period. By the agreement made today by the conference committee. the provision is restricted to cases in which the employee was entitled to such profits either for the duration of his life or for at least 5 years after retirement. so as to bring the provision more directly in line with the general provision relating to pensions. The ninth provision agreed to by the conferees today relates to the carryover of net operating losses. The Senate version of the bill contained a provision for a 4year carryover of net operating losses for new companies. that is. companies organized in the base period. By the conference agreement made finally today a 3year carryover of net operating losses for the year 1947 is allowed such new companies. This will result in an additional loss of $10.000.000.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on my own behalfand I commend this matter to the reading of every one of my colleaguesI present. for printing in the RECORD. an analysis of corporate profits for the years 1940 up to the third quarter of 1951. based on a study of the Federal Trade Commissions reports up to the third quarter of 1951. This report has been carefully checked by the economic consultants of the Federal Trade Commission. and it represents what I consider to be a factual analysis of corporate profits. which are unprecedented in the history of the United States. Let me refer to just one item. Mr. President. In 1929. corporate profits were running at the rate of 6.7 percent on the total amount of stock equity. in 1951. they were running at the rate of 13.6 percent on stock ownership. I think this fortifies the point which was made during the debate on the tax bill. namely. that the tax structure on corporate income can well stand a considerable boost. so as at least to give some equity to the tax program of the Government. Mr. President. I now ask unanimous consent to have this statement printed in the RECORD.",

But the memory of World War II is still very clear in our minds. We ought not continually to be \"behind the eight ball\" insofar as taking the initiative in Europe is concerned. The initiative today rests with Russia. it rests with Eastern Germany. Evidence of that is the number of news dispatches which have been coming out of that country within the past few weeks. added to the announcement of the East German Government that German unity discussions have started with Western Germany. That proposal of the East German Government for unity discussions with Western Germany has stalled the movement of General Eisenhower in connection with bringing West Germany into Western Europe for the defense of the West against the inroads of communism. Mr. President. I have in my hand a special dispatch to the New York Times dated Berlin. October 13. only 5 days ago. the first sentence of which is as follows: President Wilhelm Pieck said today that his East German Government wanted to start German unity discussions immediately without imposing any conditions. He said skeptical Bonn officials were mistaken if they interpreted the appeal made Wednesday by the East German Peoples Chamber as excluding such talks unless Bonns negotiations on rearmament with the Allied High Commission were dropped. Herr Pleck Insisted that East German Government was not demanding that West Germany make a choice between the east and the west. Mr. President.

Then Mr. Alsop points out that although General Eisenhower said it could be done. we should not rest with that. and goes on to say: Yet the stick is not enoughthere must also be a carrot. and a large one.

Emergency firefighting obligations were in excess of $9.000.000. The reason for the great losses was that the number of smoke chasers and firemen was not large enough to reach all fires within a reasonable length of time. It was insisted that the firefighting organization really was not as strong as it was in 1950. because the increased compensation which had been voted by Congress for those Federal employees had actually resulted in a reduction in the number. We had not increased the appropriation to pay the people as rapidly as we had Increased the rate of pay that accrued to the individuals. That Is a matter that addresses itself to the sincere judgment of every Member of the Senate. as to whether the increase of $200.000 for strengthening the firefighting organization of the Forest Service is justified. As to the item of $248.000. that was included in the bill upon the insistence of the Senator from Oregon . I wish he were here to explain it. because he made a very persuasive argument in the Appropriations Committee. His argument was that there is a great deal of timber that is down now in the forests. having been felled by storms or by insects. and that it is necessary to conserve the timber and sell it before it further deteriorates. I repeat that I wish the distinguished senior Senator from Oregon were here to justify the item. because it was added to the bill on his motion. but it was represented to the committee that the Forest Service would be able to reduce losses from deterioration of this timber that is down If there were an adequate force to cruise the timber now and to supervise its sale and marketing to those who purchase timber in the national forests.",

I am not familiar with the particular instance in regard to the State Department to which the Senator is discussing. Personally. I have had very little difficulty with the Passport Division of the State Department. but the Senator is referring to a condition which is altogether too common throughout the executive branch of the Government. Congress has enacted laws which carry a provision to this effect: The determination of the Administrator shall be final. It will be noticed that when the executive branch of the Government feels the need of a new law affecting the Veterans Administration. or some other agency. it invariably requests thai there be included the provision that the determination of the Administrator shall be final. I am not a lawyer. but I can see that the purpose is to bypass the judicial branch of the Government. We have already given authority to bypass the legislative branch of the Government. We grant rulemaking powers which give the executive branch the right to continue legislating after the Congress has passed a law which the executive branch is supposed to apply. Thus. during the past 10 or 15 years. there has been a steady weakening of the balance of power which was intended to exist between the three branches of our Government. We have been strengthening the executive branch by giving it the right to bypass Congress and to continue l2gislating after Congress has enacted laws. I would say. Mr. President. that that is one of the most serious problems. if not the most serious. we have to face today in undertaking to maintain our democratic form of government.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the bill provides for conducting investigations and for acquiring and diffusing useful information among the people of the United States. relative to agricultural production. and so forth. The House provided an appropriation of $2.320.500. The Senate has increased it by $134.500. It is the opinion of the Senator from Michigan that the House figure should be adopted. that is. that the amount should be $2.320.500. The increase in the appropriation for economic investigations by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics was voted by the committee primarily for the conduct of economic investigations in irrigation areas. The reason why I rise to speak in opposition to the amendment is because I do not believe the Department of Agriculture should specialize in economic research only in areas of irrigation. The justification supplied by the Department itself contains these words: The farm problems to which the Department programs are directed should receive services on a uniform basis. irrespective of whether the farming is carried on with or without Irrigation. and irrespective of whether irrigation water is supplied by Federal projects or otherwise. That statement is directly contradictory of the spirit of the committee amendment. I share the view of the Department of Agriculture that the farm problems to which the Department programs are directed should receive services on a uniform basis irrespective of whether the farming is carried on with or without irrigation and irrespective of whether irrigation water is supplied by Federal projects or by private projects. If we are going to have research work carried on. it should be performed for all the farmers of the Nation rather than on a specialized basis favoring a few or prejudicing a few. I hope the Senate will vote for the House figure.",

With my senior colleague from Utah I agree that there is reason to have such a dam and that we should have the water. But the fact remains that what I have stated is in the law at the present time. Therefore. whether any provision relating to the Dinosaur National Monument would go into the wilderness bill would not either enhance or degrade the present limitation.

New Yorks share is inching up. New York States share of prime contracts has risen from 11 percent in fiscal 1959. to 11.7 percent in fiscal 1960. to 12 percent in fiscal 1961. The $2.642.803.000 in total prime contracts in New York State during fiscal 1961 compares to the fiscal 1960 total of $2.377.522.000an increase of $265.281.000.

I might Point .out that not to be overlooked in the reduction in unemployment. which has nevertheless remained at a most unsatisfactory level. is the fact that from January 20 through the end of July this new administration has added a net of 82.967 civilian employees to the Federal payroll. Mobilizing 250.000 more men for the Armed Forces will also have an impact on the unemployment situation. Moreover. the administration contemplates adding another 10.000 civilian employees to the Department of Defense in connection with the buildup of 250.000 more military personnel. Nevertheless. it is apparent that the administration is not confident that all of this new Federal spending. all of these new Federal employees. and the mobilization of some of our Reserve units will get the job done. The aforementioned article in the Journal quotes Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg as predicting that the unemployment rate will fall to 51/2 to 6 percent by the end of this year. which would seem likely when the administrations plans for hiring 10.000 more civilians in connection with the military buildup plus unknown more thousands for other Federal programs are carried out. along with the mobilization of reservists. However. the Secretary is reported to have said that if this rate held into next year. it would probably prompt the White House to push for public works legislation. Mr. President. I am not a pessimist. However. I look at history to see whether or not public works legislation had any sustained favorable impact on unemployment. This same cure was tried back in the thirties during the administration of the late President Franklin Roosevelt. and the result was that unemployment remained exceedingly high until World War H bailed us out of the depression. Continued deficit spending and inflation discouraged the growth of private business needed to provide sustained high employment.

Oregon. and Colorado can look forward to is that the Secretary of State will again say to Canada. \"Send in your potatoes by the boatload. by the truckload. and compete with American potato growers of the West.\"",

It is a fact that not only potato producers in Idaho took that constructive position. but also potato producers in Colorado. so ably represented by the ranking minority member of the Committee on Finance. I am not advised as to what was the attitude of the potato producers of Washington. who were mentioned by the Senator from Idaho. The potato producers of the Nation by a great majority made it very clear that they thought the pricesupport program had been iniquitous and that it had never been justified when applied to a perishable crop. and they thought it was the existence of the pricesupport program which invited the heavy flow of Irish potatoes across our borders from Canada.",

Fla.. which is owned and operated by three very dear college friends of mine. There I saw with my own eyes the reason why the Idaho producers of potatoes. who did not care about subsidies or to depend on someone to hand out money as a guaranty. but were willing to rely on their great product. were in their grave difficulty. In the WynnLovett warehouse in Jacksonville I saw dozens of carloads of Canadian potatoes. They were being sold for practically nothing. Considering the freight differential between Idaho and Florida. it was impossible. of course. for the people of the South or even the people of the East to get the Idaho product. It was due to the opendoor policy which in effect said to Canada. \"Ship into the United States all the potatoes you can and compete against the great potato industry of the West.\" That is the situation which I wish to bring to the attention of the able Senator from Florida because it has been brought home to me. I saw hundreds of producers in Idaho last year go nearly bankrupt by reason of the policy of permitting Canadian potatoes to be imported. with no tariff. and compete against our producers. That is the question I must answer to my people back home.",

The State of North Dakota is very much interested in the potato market. because the State of Idaho and other States of the Union who wish to grow good potatoes get their potato seed from North Dakota. We furnish seed to the potato growers of Colorado. Idaho. and Nevada. We furnish seed for the State of Maine. We furnish the seed for practically every country on the face of the globe. It is the only State in the Union. I believe. in which the seed is certified and guaranteed by the State. When I was Governor of the State a law was passed which provides that the seed must be certified. Previously some seed had gone out which did not grow. We established a system under which our agricultural college and its extension divisions inspect the seed. On the sacks of seed as they are shipped out there is carried a statement which says. in effect: \"Guaranteed by the State of North Dakota.\" The State of Idaho has done good work in getting its potatoes advertised. I have gone into restaurants where they have advertised Idaho potatoes. I say to the senior Senator from Idaho that very likely the Idaho potatoes served in the restaurants came from seed which was grown in North Dakota. Coming back to what the junior Senator from Idaho said about growers in Idaho going bankrupt. I wish to invite the attention of the distinguished Senator from Nevada to one fact. and ask him a question with respect to it. Does he not know that last year in North Dakota. located adjacent to Canada. there were thousands upon thousands of acres of potatoes on which the potatoes were never dug. and that at the same time. while we were not digging the potatoes in North Dakota. thousands of tons and trainloads of potatoes came into our country from Canada?

I do not know how much direct contact our allies have had with General MacArthur. As General Marshall pointed out this morning. he was the agent of President Truman. and the allies have ample contact with the President. But I think that even when our allies are wrong. if we want to keep them as close allies we must be sympathetic with their own dissensions and difficulties. and we cannot and must not at this time take precipitous. unilateral action on these crucial and difficult questions. If we follow this course we can give our allies greater confidence in our leadership and in the dominance of the civilian leadership of our Government.",

I believe. or shortlyone of the top boutsto be sold just to theaters. and if you want to see it. you have to go to a theater because you cannot get it on your own television. That applies to certain sections of the country. The International Boxing Commission has a right to say that Boston. for instance. shall not see a television bout. and Chicago may see it. or Washington. and I am a little apprehensive here that the Boxing Commission may assume that they have the authority to say that the boxing bout shall be seen only in certain cities. The income from television rights that go with this can be terrific. I believe the committee saw fit to have an amendment adopted which limits the overall at the end of the year to $25.000. While I am not going to object to the bill. I do think. maybe. that at least the International Boxing Commission has too much authority in denying the individuals in some cities. various places throughout the country. the right to see boxing bouts on television.

It was to take care of a hospital and dispensary for the treatment of widows and other women of the Civil War period for diseases peculiar to women. back in 1866. The Congress bought a little piece of land in 1872 for $25.000. and that is where the hospital was located. The Columbia Hospital has been operating since that time. Itis interesting to note that the Congress has put in about $1.444.000 in the last 62 years. we have had an interest in it. we have owned some of the property. and we have appropriated from $5.000 to $10.000 each year for the maintenance of the heating equipment. Eight years ago the Speaker appointed me as one of the Members to represent this House on the board of directors. Under the old law of incorporation two Members of the House and one from the other body represented the Congress on the Columbia Hospital Board. I have attended a few of their meetings. The board of directors presently are appointed by the Commissioners. They have excellent individuals serving on that board without pay and running the hospital. It has been keeping its head above water and on the right side of the ledger. The hospital has given service to this community for 85 years. It was established initially as a charitable Institution and was supported by the Federal Government. Since its establishment there have been 88.882 children born in the hospital. Last year there were 4.092 children born in the hospital and of that number 993. or 24 percent. were socalled ward or charity cases. I give you this little bit of information about the hospital because It is unique In that it was established during the Civil War to take care of the troubles of women who were ill at that time.",

On top of that. the early Statessouth Florida. Texas.

Potato price ceilings always have and always will create black markets thereby diverting potatoes from the regular trade channels to the illegitimate operator for selfish purposes. He operates on a cash basis without reporting his operation to anyone and reaps the financial reward. while the legitimate shipper is often unable to secure supplies and finds it most difficult to operate with any profit if he is fortunate enough to buy the merchandise. We realize and admit if potato price ceilings were suddenly removed prices temporarily would soar. probably to the point of consumer resistance. but when this happened. black market operations would cease and the available supplies would again find their way back to the regular trade channels and the even distribution would automatically control the price and would benefit the consumer as well as the whole Industry in a short time.

I submit that the time is too short within which farm cooperatives can have audits made of their books and notify their large number of shareholders and patrons. In the case of the cotton coopertive in my own State. the number of patrons is nearly 123.000. Obviously. it would take some time to send out notices. After a conference with quite a number of cooperative leaders. I have reached the conclusion that this section should be amended. I am proposing to strike the word \"third\" and insert the word \"ninth.\" so that the cooperatives would have until the middle of the ninth month after their fiscal year began to complete their audits. make their distributions and allocations. and notify their members.

    "speech": "It has long been the practice of the Treasury and the Bureau of Internal Revenue to recognize patronage allocations by cooperatives as not being income to the cooperative. This principle was first stated soon after the adoption of the sixteenth amendment. Under the Revenue Act of 1913. Treasury Decision No. 1996. issued in 1914. announced the principle that farm cooperative associations which were not eligible for exemption under the 1913 act were permitted to exclude patronage div= idends from gross incomememorandum of Mr. Lynch. general counsel of Treasury. pages 28582859 of hearings before Ways and Means Committee. revenue revision of 1951. This principle was restated soon after the enactment of the second incometax law following the adoption of the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution. Treasury Decision No. 2737. approved June 19. 1918. interpreting that statute. announced this principle. A long series of Treasury rulings and court cases have followed this principle without deviation. and it has been a longestablished administrative practice. One of the better known Treasury rulings is General Counsel Memorandum No. 17895. issued in 193.7. in which the following statement appears: For the purposes of the administration of the Federal incometax laws. such distributions have been treated as deductions in determining the taxable net income of the distributing cooperative organization. Such distributions. however. when made pursuant to a prior agreement between the cooperative organization and its patrons are more properly to be treated as exclusions from gross income of the cooperative organization. One of the leading cases of the United States Tax Court is that of United Cooperatives. Inc. v. Commissioner. decided December 29. 1944 (4 T. C. 93). In that case the Court said: It would follow in the usual case that the socalled patronage dividends would be treated for tax purposes by the Tieasury Department as rebates upon the business transacted by its members. and would therefore be excluded from gross income in computing net Income subject to tax. The Court. of course. was referring to whether the cooperative was taxable. It is my understanding that the incometax treatment of cooperatives contained in section 314 of the bill confirms and follows this longestablished administrative practice as stated in the ruling and court decision from which I have just quoted. Am I correct in this understanding?",

I went ahead and asked how many full bloods there are. From this and other sources I got answers all the way from 80.000 to 120.000. I appealed to the Census Bureau. which in the recent census cataloged the Indians by States. and listed there the number of Indians now on the rolls being cared for and everyone considered as an Indian in his community. The Census Bureau can find only 282.000 .Indians in this country despite the claims of the Indian Bureau and others that they are taking care of 426.000. As a matter of fact. outside of the large reservations in Arizona and New Mexico. and a few in Montana and other States. there are not more than 15.000 fullblood Indians in this whole country. just about 1.000 more than the nearly 14.000 persons employed by the Indian Office.",

This the committee already knows. and more can be developed in the same direction. making it additionally incumbent upon this House to probe to the bottom any dealings between the National Guardian. its officials and the United Nations World.

That brings to my mind a matter which I wonder if the gentleman is familiar withI do not think the general public isand that is the role of the FBI in the investigation of corruption among public officials. I understand on rather direct and reliable authority that it is the policy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to discontinue investigations when they run upon the name of a public official. Now that may be a very desirable policy from the point of view of the FBI. It may have kept the FBI out of hot water through not stepping on important peoples toes. I think the general publicand the Members of Congresshave the utmost respect for and confidence in J. Edgar Hoover and in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I believe. however. that this question might have arisen in their minds: \"Well now. if all of this wrongdoing that is now coming out has been in existence so long. and the FBI has been in existence so long. why has not some of it come out before through the activities of the FBI rather than waiting for congressional committees to expose it?\" But the answer to that is that FBI policy has been to desist from investigating when they run upon the name of a public official unless they are specifically ordered in writing by the Justice Department to proceed with the investigation. Apparently the Justice Department has not very often instructed the FBI to proceed with investigations when their preliminary findings disclose wrongdoing by public officials.",

The Congress. in 1922 or 1923 passed the Budget and Accounting Act to change the method of auditing the accounts of the executive agencies and checking on the legality of their expenditures. Prior to that time the executive branch audited itself. and that was not a desirable proposition for obvious reasons. That defect was corrected by setting up in the Budget and Accounting Act. an independent auditing agency. the General Accounting Office. subject only to the Congress. and headed by a Comptroller General. appointed for 15 years. not eligible for reappointment. and given a maximum of independence. Inasmuch as Congress had to do that to get fair. accurate. and impartial auditing. The day may have come when we need to set up something like it to prosecute persons in the Government about whom the FBI turns up derogatory evidence. It would have to be an agency separate from and not under the Attorney General who is a member of the Presidents own official family. He needs his legal counsel but perhaps the people ought to have also a lawyer other than the administrations lawyer. It is asking a lot to expect a man to take action that would hurt those who hired him. People generally do not understand this situation. they think the FBI is responsible for getting rid of dangerous. or crooked. or unfit people in the Governmentand they feel secure. They do not realize that the FBI merely investigates. turns its findings over to its superior. the Attorney General. and cannot do anything more. in the absence of overt acts. unless or until the Attorney General acts. Human nature being what it Is. a person is not inclined to try his best to expose and condemn and convict those who appointed him to the office.

One question was whether he got anything out of it. He said he did not. but apparently he shared in fees to the extent of some thirty or thirtyfive thousand dollars. less the overhead cost of operating the law office. that could appropriately be charged to this particular client. I quote Mr. Morris testimony on this point elsewhere in my remarks. The question I wanted to take up with the gentleman from Minnesota is the matter of carrying oil to the Communists in these tankers. I looked at the record very carefully to see whether or not Mr. Morris was justified in resenting the implications of impropriety in carrying oil from a Rumanian port to a Communist Chinese port. shipments which were discontinued only shortly before the Korean war began. Mr. Morris defense. in part at least. se ed to be that by that trade his company was draining dollars out of Communist countries. It was not dollars for oil. The oil came from behind the iron curtain and It stayed behind the iron curtain. but the dollars for shipping charges. which were higher than similar runs for other cargoes. had to come out of the Communist countries. Thereby. he argued. his company was fighting communism and was weakening the Communists. The testimony before the Hoey committee on this point is. in part. as follows: Senator NIXON. Do you or do you not agree with Secretary Johnsons appraisal of that situation. that this was detrimental. that this action of United Tankers in hauling oil to and from Communist China was detrimental to the interests of the United States?",

Our distinguished colleague has made a great contribution to the legislative record since he entered the House of Representatives. I regret exceedingly that he has decided to leave this body and return to the practice of law. I always regret to see a colleague who has demonstrated his ability and leadership in the House of Representatives retire at the very time when his experience and ability are so important to the welfare of his country. I recall what Hon. DeAlva Stanwood Alexander. A. M.. L. L. D.. a former member of Congress. had to say with reference to the value of long service as a legislator. \"Prominence gained in one vocation is rarely transferred to another. Legislation is a profession as much as medicine or law or journalism. the practice of which. to gain leadership. must be long and continuous. until proposed public measures and their treatment. worked out in the drudgery of the committee room. become as familiar as the variety of questions submitted to lawyers and physicians.\" I am sure that every member who has served with the Honorable LEONARD W. HALL has recognized his fine legal ability. Furthermore. our good friend. Leonard. has made a splendid contribution in solving many complex problems that have come before the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee of which he is a distinguished member. I cannot question the wisdom of my good friend leaving Congress before he is too old to resume the practice of law. It is rather tragic in many instances to see men of great ability remain in the House until they are too old to return to their vocation or profession with any hope of success. I feel very sure that our good distinguished colleague. who is a comparatively young man. will soon fill an important judicial position in the area where he is so well known and beloved. There is only one thing that we can do on an occasion of this kind and that is to wish for our fine colleague many years of health. happiness. and success in whatever field he may enter or to which he may be called.

In the 2 minutes time alloted to me I cannot add anything to this argument. although I did feel at one time that I did have a few things that I might say that would shed a little light on this situation. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia . of course. draws the issue on price and wage controls. The reason that it is encountering so much opposition here Is not because it freezes prices but because it freezes wages as well. We all know that a freeze of one without a freeze of the other would not solve our present dilemma. Last week. if you will recall. 200 Members of this House were held in captive audience over in the Ways and Means Committee room. where they listened to the lobbying leadership of organized labor. Mr. Carey. Mr. Murray. and Mr. Green. who told them that what organized labor wanted was an effective price control bill. otherwise they would not submit to wage controls. Now. this amendment has been called the Baruch plan by some. and that has been denied by others. In fact it is the CIO plan. It is giving Mr. Carey and Mr. Murray and Mr. Green exactly what they were asking for when they lobbied the members in the Ways and Means Committee room last week. Then only the other day. when the Secretary of Labor made a speech downtown to an AFL organized group. Mr. George Meaney of the American Federation of Labor made a speech following that of the Secretaryaccording to the newspapersin which he repeated what Mr. Carey had previously told you: If organized labor did not get any effective price controls bill. it was going to refuse to submit to wage controls.

It is true that my amendment would freeze beef at 152 percent of parity. It is also true it would freeze some wages in an inequitable status. some low and some high. It would also freeze some agricultural commodities at lower than parity as well as some above parity. But this is the first time the Davis amendment has been clarified to the point where it falls with equal force upon everyone in the United States. whether it be the farmer or the workingman. the consumer or the producer or the seller.

One Member makes an impossible amendment. then another offers an amendment to it and the third Member to demonstrate the invalidity of the proposition throws something else in. and then he says he will have to vote for it.

It does not freeze most food prices or rents. yet they constitute well over 50 percent of the moderateincome familys budget. It fails to take into account the essential oil. rubber. nickel. manganese. and other strategic materials we import from abroad so essential to the defense effort.

I would certainly disagree with the amendment. It is true that this amendment provides savings and loan associations can purchase mortgages beyond a distance of 50 miles from home. I agree that savings and loan associations are organized and are operated as local institutions with local money to help local people build homes in a particular community but it does occur to me that occasionally these savings and loan associations find their portfolios in such condition that they are not able to lend money to build homes in the community because they are unable to obtain the money locally. This will permit them under those circumstances to go beyond the present limitation and buy mortgages at a distance greater than 50 miles. I am therefore inclined to believe that the House should accept this amendment at the present time. If. in the future. we find the authority is abused. Congress can correct that situation by such limiting legislation as may be necessary.",

This conference report is not going to do a bit of harm to anyone. and it is going to do a lot of good to a lot of people. The original Home Loan Act of 1933 provided that these savings and loan associations could not operate outside of the 50mile limit. Now this does not change that. except in one instance. and that is that they may purchase PHAinsured mortgages outside of their 50mile limit but they cannot originate loans outside of their 50mile limit. All they may do is purchase such mortgages. In my opinion it will facilitate the mortgage market to a degree that will provide housing for many. many people that would not otherwise obtain it. It will give the FHA insured mortgage market an opportunity to operate across the Nation. The amendment makes it permissive and not mandatory.

In all I introduced seven bills on this subject and the bill which will be finally presented to the President closely resembles the bill. H. R. 7642. which I introduced some weeks ago. I am particularly gratified that the entire education and training allowance is to go to these veterans whose good sense and initiative will be used in determining the type of education and training for which each one is best suited. With the enactment of this bill every benefit which was granted to World War II veterans by legislation emanating from the Committee on Veterans Affairs will be provided the veterans of the Korean conflict. Mr. Speaker. I yield 10 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts .",

General DEVEREUX. is leaving the Committee on Veterans Affairs and going to the Committee on Armed Services. He has been a very valiant fighter on the committee for veterans rights. He knows all of the laws pertaining to the soldiers. to the servicemen. he knows all the laws now pertaining to the veterans. I would like to state that he was in constant attendance. He never missed a subcommittee hearing and he never missed a full committee hearing. and he never missed a meeting on the floor of the House. You all know that General DEVEREUX was decorated for bravery during the war. Sometimes it takes bravery to speak on the floor. I know. General DEVEREUX is a great fighter. Mr. Speaker. I think that this report In the main is an excellent report. There was some yielding and giving in while the measure was In conference. I personally would like to have had the Nixon amendment adopted which would have provided direct payments to private schools and institutions. but that was voted out. the conferees voted against it. I was extremely glad that an unemployment insurance compensation amendment was agreed to. It provides $26 a week for 26 weeks. I believe no Member of the House will be opposed to that. Our men in Korea. our fighting men. certainly are entitled to unemployment insurance. The working people of this country. at good wages and happy conditions. are entitled to unemployment compensation. You will recall my remarks in this House yesterday when I said that I did not see how any human being who voted to give unemployment insurance to people who work in factories and other places at good pay could refuse to give unemployment insurance to men who toil and sweat while facing death in Korea. This feature of the measure was one of the bones of contention in the conference. I am glad to say that I stood by my support of it throughout the discussions. sometimes without much aid. However. I am very happy that this title IV remains in the bill. I believe that the report will be unanimously adopted.",

It is a bill that has had every consideration that any bill should have that passes the Congress. Mr. Speaker. the gentleman from Maryland asked concerning the differences between the bill in its present form and the form in which it passed the House. One of the major differences adopted by the Senate was the amendment suggested by the gentleman from Maryland that the classification of veterans be separated for subsistence purposes into three dependency groups. the single veteran. the veteran with one dependent. and the veteran with more than one dependent. Mr. Speaker. I wish to compliment the gentleman from Maryland for the steps he took to correct the bill. and I think his amendments have improved the bill. The Senate raised the amoufit of the allowance for a veteran with more than one dependent. Another difference between the bill approved by the conferees and as it passed the House is that as it passed the House the bill required 25 percent nonveterans in courses offered by profit schools. The Senate reduced that to 10 percent and the conferees agreed on 15 percent. Another difference is that the Senate placed in the bill a provision to pay all schools something for the administrative burden this bill imposes on them. That amount was $1.50 per veteran.

Of course. what the gentleman from Pensylvania [ says is true. There were abuses in colleges. the same as there were In other groups of schools. The law set up a limit of $500 for tuition and fees In school. but some schools raised their rates as close to the $500 as possible. In many schools the veteran had to buy books not required for nonveterans. Some schools increased the tuition as much as 300 percent. In this bill we turn this scholarship allowance over to the veteran. I think he has sufficient good judgment and good sense to go to the best school for him.

I would like to compliment the chairman of the subcommittee. the gentleman from Alabama . as well as the subcommittee for having done an outstandingly fine job. I was not on that subcommittee. so perhaps I can say it with a certain objectivity and propriety. There are two points I would like to leave with the House in this situation. First. this bill is an excellent bill because it fights economic warfare with a precision rifle and not with a blunderbuss. We hale heard a lot of statements. well intentioned and sincere on the floor here and on the floor in the other body about cutting off all trade with the Soviet bloc to bring them to their senses. cutting it off completely. isolating them from the world economically. I understand the ultimate objective and agree with it. Few seem to recognize. however. that for centuries Western Europe drew its very lifebloodgrain and timber and other materialsfrom Eastern Europe. and such relationships cannot be suddenly and completely broken by severing those ancient ties which existed for centuries with a sharp knife. It can be done and is done in this bill. of course. as to arms and materials strategic to war preparations. But that still leaves a broad area as to which cotton was just given as an example. In this third category economic warfare is a subtle proposition. You can get awfully hurt and you can get greatly benefited. It all depends on how the job is done and on that this bill does a fine job. The subcommittee is entitled to the thanks of the whole country for that beyond peradventure. Second. we must understand that when we ask our friends to sever long standing economic relationships with parts of the world now in the Soviet bloc. as we are in the process of doing now. somebody has to help them to make up for that. during a transition stage. So. let us get an understanding that in dealing with the peoples of Western Europe that are breaking off long standing economic relationships that we have to help them to make up the deficits in the period which they are now going through. the transition period. while world economic relationships are realined.",

I say. if we must not take the policy of removing Soviet Russia from the United Nationswhich is the policy which I feel we should pursue. together with severing relationships with her and her satellites who are doing direct or indirect combat to ourselvesthen I would say that this legislation is a welldrawn bill. It does not permit injury that might be done by a more drastic measure and it appears to be a workable bill. but I personally feel that we should have even a more vigorous and forthright approach than is indicated in this bill.

The committee went ahead with the Oatis resolution and expressed the intention at the time that as soon as we can get to the Hvasta case and three or four other similar cases after the bill now under consideration by the Foreign Affairs Committee is written. we will take up the Hvasta case at the first opportunity.

I had hoped that a more forceful declaration in this case would be made.

Throughout our history we have had problems like this to face. and always in other cases stern and forceful action has been taken to the end that it has been a long time since anyone dared mistreat lawabiding American citizens going on legitimate business throughout the world. I think if we do not have anyone in the administrative branch of the Government who is willing to take the positive forceful action necessary to help this man. the Congress ought to do It. I think the time has come when we have to make known how this Nation feels. We have to let the people know that in this Congress we are not going to tolerate this sort of thing. These declarations of indignation are fine. but I think in dealing with the satellites behind the iron curtain and with Soviet Russia we ought to know by now that you never get any results until you get tough. The days that William Oatis spends In jail In Czechoslovakia wondering what his Nation and his Government is going to do for him are not going to be much comfort it seems to me when he knows that we are only indignant about it.

It seems to me that we would be much better off in our international relations if we would hark back to the days of Theodore Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt was the originator of the socalled bigstick policy. and it worked. Teddy Roosevelt felt America should always tread softly.

Oatis. that the executive agencies of the Government be requested to take all possible action to bring about his release. and that the sense of resolution be conveyed by the proper officials of our Government to the United Nations and to the officials of the Czechoslovakian Government.

Oatis right to freedom is based upon some provision of the United Nations Charter. thus ignoring the declaration by Congress on July 4. 1776 when it expressly declared that the right \"to life. liberty and the pursuit of happines were given us by the Creator.\" (2) It assumes that to protect the right to freedom given by the Creator and guaranteed by the Constitution. the United States of America is dependent upon action by United Nations. That assumption is an absurdity.

Every Member of the Senate knows that there is widespread confusion throughout the United States as to the sending of troops to various areas of the world. Everyone of us receives hundreds of letters expressing that confusion. I do not want to add to the confusion. I want in my small way to help dissipate it if possible. Other Senators receive. as I receive. hundreds of letters which ask. \"What are our boys doing in Korea? We are not at war. Under what authority do we have hundrcds of thousands of troops in the Korean area? Has Congress abdicated its responsibility?\" I do not know how other Senators reply. but I reply that Congress has a responsibility. and that in the exercise of that responsibility and in ratifying the treaty of the United Nations by a vote of 85 to 5. as I recall. Congress made the commitments under which this action has been taken. I do not subscribe to the view of those who. honestly or for partisan reasons. say. \"This is Trumans war.\" It is not Trumans war. There is a responsibility and a commitment which we must assume. I make that reply to those who inquire from me with reference to the troops in Korea.",

Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security. The reason why I sought to read article 5 at this point in the remarks of the Senator from Iowa is that it gives emphasis to what the distinguished Senator is saying with respect to sending United States troops anywhere in the world. By the ratification of this protocol. whereby two additional countries would become members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. it seems to me that we are accepting for the United States the obligation to consider an armed attack upon either Greece or Turkey as an attack upon us. carrying with it the implied authority for the President of the United States to send our Armed Forces to the defense of Greece or Turkey wherever they might be attacked. and upon whatever provocation. We would be entrusting to the keeping of the representatives of Greece and Turkey judgment and discretion with respect to acts which might be committed by Greece or Turkey or by any of their representatives. which might precipitate an attack.

As all of us know. that unification was not accomplished by a reorganization plan. although the legislative enactment made by the House and the Senate paralleled the reorganization plan. I am almost positive that economies have been effected by providing for the joint use of military hospitals. by combining the three worldcircling airlines which the three branches of the armed services were operating into the present Military Air Transport Service. by placing in one agency all overseas shipping operations of the armed services. thus merging the Navy transport service with the Army transport service. and by many of the other consolidations which have been effected under that legislation. It seems to me that the total savings made In that way undoubtedly exceed the $28.000.000 or the $33.000.000 which the committee staff and the Bureau of the Budget have. respectively. attributed to the rorganizations made on recommendations of the Hoover Commission. My point is that. regardless of whether Congress chose to enact a reorganization plan as such. or whether Congress enacted a statutory measure which had the end result of accomplishing the recommendations which were made by the Hoover Commission. perhaps those savings would not have occurred if it had not been for the activities of the Hoover Commission. In short. it seems to me that to state that the work of the Hoover Commission has resulted in no economies or in infinitesimal economies. is scarcely in line with the facts.",

It was stated by many Senators that this might be done in the United States either by treaty or by the approval of a majority of both Houses of Congress. I interpolate that the President seemed to be cognizant of what was taking place in that debate. There was an argument as to whether approval should be by the Senate in the form of a treaty or whether by both Houses of Congress. It was also stated that the initiative in this matter rested with the President. and that it was most important to know before action was taken on the Charter which course was to be pursued.

The difference lies in the fact that simple and concurrent resolutions are organically different from joint resolutions. and follow different parliamentary channels. Unlike the other resolutions a joint resolution calls for the approval of the President. It. therefore. has a different character and a different treatment under the rules of the Senate. As a result. when a simple resolution or a concurrent resolution is reported to the floor. it cannot. under the rules of the Senate. be amended so as to make either one a joint resolution. To many people that seems odd. because they are aware we do not have such a thing as a rule of relevancy in the Senate. Under the Constitution some State legislatures are compelled to have contained in the body of a measure what is showr in the title of the measure. Such a rule does not apply in the Senate. and nongermane amenCments to pending measures are not infrequent. But because a joint resolution is like a bill and is organically different from a simple or concurrent resolution they may not be amended to become a joint resolution. In order to convert either of the pending resolutions into a joint resolution. in the present parliamentary situation. it would be necessary. as I have previously stated. to secure unanimous consent. I think everyone agrees that such unanimous consent cannot be obtained. Other possibilities. which would not be amending the pending resolutions. would be to recommit either of them with instructions to report back a joint resolution forthwith. or simply to introduce a new joint resolution. I want to stress that the devices of a Senate resolution and a concurrent resolution n this instance are all camouflage. What is back of it? It is an effort to try to save the face of the President. who has said. in effect. \"The armed servic:s belong to me.

In view of the treaty our Government has with the Navajo Indians. it seems a shame that we cannot furnish them with necessary educational facilities. one schoolroom and one teacher for 30 students.

I remember the days on the other side of the Capitol when appropriations for the Indian Bureau reached $32.000.000 a year. and I made. by rule of thumb. a ready calculation which indicated that the amount appropriated represented $1.000 for every Indian in addition to whatever social security benefits he had. and in addition to whatever other general benefits inured to him by virtue of residence in the United States of America. Last year the budget estimate reached $71.000.000. and if I correctly remember the figure in this bill. the appropriation is roughly $67.000.000 for the fiscal year 1952. Of that amount. there is roughly $23.000.000 for education. I think we are now spending $2.300.000 for socialwelfare activities. for placement. guidance. and a great many other things. I am wondering about this kind of expenditure. It is a little startling when we realize that 13.006 civilian employees of the Governmentand I should like to be corrected if I am wrong--are administering the affairs of X number of Indians. Not even that number has been determined. The Census Bureau has one rule by which it determines what constitutes an Indian. The Indian Bureau has another. and there is quite a disparity between their estimates. I think the Indian Bureau insists that there are 393.000 Indians in the country. The Census Bureau says. roughly. 333.000. Some years ago I had this rather entrancing experience: I sent a letter to the Indian Bureau. I simply said to Mr. John Collier. who was at that time at the head of that activity. \"What is an Indian?\" I got back four pages of singlespaced typewriting. and when I got through I could not find out what an Indian was. I addressed a letter to the Bureau of the Census. I got back five pages. To this good hour. I do not quite know what an Indian is. although by one standard probably onesixtyfourth blood entitles one to be on the tribal rolls. By that standard the second Mr. Woodrow Wilson would have been enrolled upon the rolls of the Indian Bureau. and if numbers mean anything for the purpose of getting anything out of Congress. that is a very felicitous way to do it.",

I think. in any other way to bring the Indian population of the United States to a better realization of the opportunities which are presented to them. The record of the last war shows that Indians have been subject to military duty and have performed that duty with great credit to themselves and to the country. The record of defense mobilization during World War II shows. throughout the country. that Indians have been employed in industrial establishments. and to great advantage. In recent years there has been a substantial degree of progress. There are many. many errors in the administration of Indian affairs. I have no doubt about that. But with respect to education. it certainly is an obligation which the Congress of the United States owes to the aboriginal inhabitants of this continent. I assure the Senator that if the will and desire of the chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs will bring it about. the study which is now in progress will result in a report upon which the Congress may act.",

It would appear that now is the time that the students and faculty of West Point would most appreciate an orientation on world affairs such as the passage of House Joint Resolution 285 could make possible. I recall with mixed feelings that dark moment in North Korea last December when the Supreme Commander of U. N. forces in the Far East stated in effect that the conflict had reached such proportions as to require disposition of the chancellories of the world. It was to be resolved by higher authorities. Yet when negotiations on a diplomatic level were proceeding. as urged by this commander. exception was taken. I think it would be a wonderful thing for the faculty and cadets at West Point to benefit by the passage of House Joint Resolution 285 at this time.",

Minn.. who served with distinction as a Member of the House of Representatives from March 4. 1921. to March 3. 1933. He passed away on March 25. 1952. I had the privilege of serving with Mr. Clague for 8 years. He was a man of unusual ability who enjoyed the highest respect of his colleagues. I considered him as one of the outstanding Americans in public life. It can be said about Mr. Clague that he was the type of American whose word was as good as his bond. Mr. Clague served as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and also as a member of the Appropriations Committee while he had the opportunity of representing the Second Congressional District of Minnesota in this body. Those of my colleagues who had the privilege to serve with Mr. Clague respected him for his high character and unusual soundness of opinion in accordance with American ideals. Frank Clague was born in Warrensville. Cuyahoga County. Ohio. July 13. 1865. He was 87 years old at the time of his death. He moved to Minnesota in 1881 and taught school at Springfield. Minn.. from 1886 to 1890. he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1891 and commenced practice in Lamberton. Minn.. the same year. He was prosecuting attorney of Redwood County. Minn.. from 1895 to 1903. and was a member of the State legislature and the speaker of the house of representatives from 1903 to 1907. He also served in the Minnesota State Senate. He was district judge of the Ninth Judicial District of Minnesota from 1919 to 1920. at which time he was elected as a Republican to the Sixtyninth Congress. He retired voluntarily in 1933 and resumed the practice of law in Redwood Falls. Minn.

Frank served the people of our State and of my congressional district particularly. in many capacities. His career of public service began in 1886 when he was a school teacher. After he became a member of the bar. he was prosecuting attorney of Redwood County for 13 years during which time he was also a member of the State house of representatives where he served as speaker. He was a member of the State senate from 1907 to 1915 and served as judge of the ninth judicial district for a year before he resigned to run for Congress. He assumed this heavy obligation not because of the personal benefits to be derived but because of the contribution he felt he could make to the welfare of his community. State. and Nation. After six terms. he did not seek renomination but remained in Redwood Falls where he practiced law and continued to assist our people with his sage advice and through his great unselfish spirit. Mr. Speaker. to know Frank Clague was to respect and admire him. He was most sincere and had the capacity for true and abiding friendship. He never disappointed anyone who placed confidence in him. Frank had an abundance of sound. common sense. and he was always faithful to the principles in which he believed. There was never any ostentation about him. He was a man of absolute integrity. His unfailing kindness made him beloved by all who knew him. The people of Minnesota and of my district in particular have lost an able friend. and we all suffer a deep personal sorrow at his passing.

The inference was that our people are twice as well off. Let us see if that is so. When one changes $3.000 into 6.000 halfdollars. is one better off? That is exactly what we have done with our dollars since 1940. An article in the current issue of the Readers Digest points out that a man earning $3.000 in 1940 must earn $6.072 today to enjoy the same standard of living as he did in 1940. A $5.000 man in 1940 must get $10.542 today. a $10.000 man in 1940 must get $22.850 today. a $25.000 man in 140 must get $76.332. What the genial gentleman from Massachusetts did not point out is the fact that our peoplewhile they have twice as many dollars in their pocketsare paying today just 12 times as much in taxes as they did in 1940. In 1940 Uncle Sam collected $5.000.000.000 in taxes. That was the peak tax load up to that time. Today Uncle Sam is collecting $60.000.000.000 in taxes12 times as much as he did in 1940.

Certainly when we lead people onto that high mountain and they suddenly discover that the proposal would have no binding effect. there is going to be a frustration such as we have never seen before .in this country.

He is subject to orders. He is subject to serving anywhere he may be ordered to serve. If he is sent to the front lines in Korea. he goes to the front lines in Korea. On the other hand. if his superior military commanders decide that he should serve in Washington. New Hampshire. on the west coast. or in Germany. Greece. or somewhere else. he goes wherever he is ordered to go. When he enters the service he loses all control over where he is to serve. Where he serves is entirely in the hands of his superior commanders. He has nothing to say about it. The Senator knows that during World War II there were many men who grieved because they were left at home. The same situation was true in World War I. I think the Senator and I can bear witness to the fact that during World War I. in which he and I both served in the Armed Forces. many men were dissatisfied because they were left at home and were not sent into some combat area. They felt that they had been called into service. or had volunteered. to fight for their country. In the case of many of them. instead of being sent to some combat area they were kept here. undoubtedly for some good reason. either to supervise training. give courses of instruction. or for some other particular purpose. So when a man once puts on his uniform and enters the service of the Armed Forces he loses all control over where he is to serve or what his service shall be.

It is beside the immediate point that we would not have many of our present troubles had prompt action been taken under the Aaw passed by this Congress. The fact is that those things did occur. and our price structure is discolored and mutilated by them. As a matter of general philosophy. I am very much opposed to price rollbacks. I realize that under the best possible circumstances there are inconveniences and harassments to those who are subject to them. and some injustices.

Mr. President. if a rollback were made under the provisions of this amendment. the result might be to call for a complete recomputation of all ceiling prices in a competitive field. I also point out that the amendment includes all costs. In other words. it will allow the abuses which have been referred to in connection with the excessprofits tax. That matter was discussed here at some length. and considerable worry was expressed about it. The amendment would include legal costs. advertising costs. entertainment costs. and all other costs. In other words. under the amendment. all costs must be included in establishing the price. Under the competitive enterprise system. we attempt to have some cost absorption. not simply cost accounting. It is in that way that a manufacturer is able to sell his product and to compete with other manufacturers who have similar products to sell.

    "speech": "Mr. President. if the distinguished Senator from Mississippi will permit me to ask several questions about the recommended appointment of Gen. Hoyt Sanford Vandenberg to continue as Air Force Chief of Staff. I should be most grateful. As the Senator from Mississippi well knows. anannouncement was made on March 2. 1952. that the President of the United States intended to renominate Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg to serve an extra 14 months as Air Force Chief of Staff. In announcing the Presidents intention. a White House secretary. Mr. Joseph Short. explained why General Vandenberg was getting a \"bobtail\" reappointment. The President. Mr. Short said. wants to make sure that General Vandenberg will have an opportunity. as Chief of Staff. to round out his full 30 years of military service. The President does not wish General Vandenberg to be in a subordinate command before he retires. On one of the days of last week. the Senate Committee on Armed Services considered the Presidents recommendation concerning Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg. and the Air Force Secretary. Mr. Finletter. spoke seriously and frankly about several issues raised. My question to the Senator from Mississippi is this: Did the Air Force Secretary. Mr. Finletter. when testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee. recommend that the present tour of duty as Air Force Chief of Staff by General Vandenberg be extended for a further 14 months. because he. the Secretary of the Air Force. wanted General Vandenberg to serve in office until General Vandenberg was ready for retirement. and because the Air Force Secretary did not wish General Vandenberg to take command of a socalled subordinate command within the Air Force?",

On those very two points there was a unanimous and a very strong. firm conviction in the Armed Services Committee. that the propositien of making an important appointment to a post like this for 14 months merely to coincide with a mans possible retrement date was wholly without merit ard beside the point. and the committee would not approve it in any form on those grounds. urthermore. the idea of not calling on a man of this caliber and experience to fill a socalled subordinate post after having served as Chief of Staff was not in keeping with the thinking of the committee. A man in such a position would be perhaps at the height of his power and service to the Nation. and should be willingand. so far as I know. General Vandenberg was willingto take a socalled subordinate post. It was further represented to us that perhaps the statement from the White House did not really reflect the Presidents reasoning and intention in the matter. after all.",

Mr. Finletter in support of extending General Vandenbergs tour of duty. The Senator from Washington. as best he remembers. asked this question of the Air Force Secretary: \"Mr. Secretary. would it not be a reasonable course to pursue in the future. whenever the White House intends to make an announcement concerning a subject about which the White House necessarily in many instances knows too little. that it offer the announcement it intends to make to the appropriate military branch within the. Pentagon?\" Mr. Finletter responded by saying that although it might be a more advantageous procedure to follow than has been carried out in the past. it was not within his province to reflect on the question. He said. \"I am a subordinate officer within the executive branch of the Government. It was my duty to recommend to the White House that Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg be continued on for another 14 months period.\" Then the Secretary went on to say. \"But I do not feel that it is within my responsibility or my authority to question the White House as to what announcement it intends to make on any recommendation submitted to it.\"",

In one case approximately 18.000 persons are employed in a competing firm. and the large firm provides for 21/2 weeks of vacation with pay. Other plans provide for 2 weeks of vacation. The firm to which I refer is being denied. under the guise of wage stabilization. the right to meet that competitive situation by means of providing for 2 weeks vacation with pay.

The House committee cut the amount to $16.426.000. and. on the floor of the House. it was cut to $15.000.000. The amendment of the Senator from Michigan would reduce the appropriation to the figure to which it was cut In the House. whereas the Senate committee put it back to the House committee figure of $16.426.000. Why is this money needed? The store sales. plus the goods which are stored. amounted in 1950 to $26.000.000. in 1951. to $35.000.000. and in 1952 they are estimated at $88.000.000. The direct delivery sales were $51.000.000 in 1950. $56.000.000 in 1951. and estimated to be $61.000.000 in 1952. The purpose of providing for store sales is to enable the agencies to buy in bulk and then to store in warehouses. The money proposed to be appropriated is needed to enable the agency to place in warehouses the goods bought in the socalled store sales. If the money is not allowed for the warehouses. then it Is impossible to have the store sales. and if we make this further cut. which will be a total cut of more than $3.000.000 in the amount estimated. the consequence will be that we shall simply be unable to carry out the purposes of the Hoover Commission. because of the impossibility of buying goods in advance. as a result of having no place in which to store them.

I believe there are 95 inspectors out of a personnei force of 131. However. I wish to call the attention of the Senate to what I understand to be the fact that there are seven vacancies in the Bureau at the present time. although funds were appropriated for those positions last year. Funds for them have naturally been requested again for 1952. We must also bear in mind that these percentage cuts are made against budget requests. rather than against the number on the payroll t~his year. The Bureau gets creditautomatically for those vacancies if they are not filled. The averaze zalary in the Bureau is $5.894. That means that a credit of possibly $40.000 will automatically be applied against the cut made in the budget estimates. At that point the Bureau will be left with the work force which now Is on the job. Any further reductions would have to be absorbed in other ways. but particularly in administration. Of course. Mr. President. we realize that when we propose cuts in the funds for the administration of a particular agency. representatives of the agency are always inclined to say to Congress that the result will be a reduction in some vital part of the work of the agency. rather than in the number of clerical positions or in the amount of overhead.",

    "speech": "When we deal with work in the field of safety. I must say to the distinguished Senator from Michigan that the question is not what one person may do when he makes inspections in the field. but the question is what he may be able to accomplish in the way of education among those who work in the shops--for instance. education of the section crews or the engineers or the brakemen or the conductors or the switchmen. The inspector must do educational work with them. in order to teach them how to assure safety in the operations of the railroad or in the operations of the division or the shop. The great safety record made in the United States in its industrial plants. and elsewhere. has been achieved as a result of educational work. rather than work by the individual inspectors in the field. If a reduction were made in the number of persons who engage in the safety work. there would be a decrease in the results ichieved in the field in terms of reducing accidents and reducing the resultant losses. So. as a colleague and as a fellow member of the Appropriations Committee. I say to the Senator that I regret exceedingly that I cannot agree with him. I understand that he is entirely sincere in attempting to bring about economy in Government. and of course his purpose is most laudable. Nevertheless. in this particular case I am afraid that if the personnel are reduced. there will be a decrease in the educational work in connection with the attempt to minimize the losses occurring on the railroads.",

However. it cannot be contended with correctness that this program is an educational one. These men make spot checks in the shops. The superintendents and others in the shops are the skilled men in the field. and they are the ones who do the real work. This item relates to inspections to see whether the work is done. rather than to an educational program. I hope that those on the other side. who contend that we are in error. will appreciate. in turn. the sincerity of our efforts to reduce the staggering load of the Federal budget. I am sure the amount of the reduction now proposed can be absorbed in the overhead and in the general operations. rather than by making a reduction in the number of inspectors. Mr. President. we have previously had an example of this situation. Some time ago when we said we would make a reduction in the appropriations for the Customs Service. the officials of that Service said that if the cut were made. they would have to reduce the number of men engaged in the patrol work. which of course is the vital part of the Customs Service. and of course an argument based on that claim has a real appeal to the Members of Congress. Similarly. in this case. the officials claim that the cut we propose will cause a reduction in the number of inspectors. rather than in the overhead. However. we believe that all of the proposed reduction can be absorbed in the overhead. without doing harm to a program which has unquestioned value. Therefore. Mr. President.

It need not be used. however. unless it is desired to use it. and it should be used only in a time of emergency when conditions may be specifically injurious to a certain agricultural product.

No one familiar with the dairy industry can deny that to open the floodgates at a time when the flush season is coming on would be disastrous to the American dairy industry. and possibly precipitate a condition which would result in a shortage of milk in this country for some years to come. I quote froin the 1952 Production Goals handbook which has just been issued by the Department of Agriculture. Speaking of milk production the Secretary of Agriculture says: Production during the past several years has been relatively stable. however. while population has been increasing. Per capita production. therefore. has declinedreaching a record low In 1951. I quote further: Factors pointing to an increase in demand for milk and its products during 1952 and 1953 include the growing population. alltime high employment and wages and no foreseeable letup in military requirements. I quote further: The maintenance of milk production may be an increasingly difficult problem during 1952 and 1953. I quote further: More favorable returns from certain other major agricultural commodities may encourage some farmers to shift from dairying to other kinds of farming. Mr. President. it is vitally important that we do not take any steps which would permit a flood of dairy products to come into this country at this time of the year. It may be that we may have to increase our imports during the period from September to February. From February to July we are bound to have heavy surpluses. if we maintain a sufficient number of cows to supply the countrys fluid milk needs during the other 6 months. It would be much better. if we are to increase imports above what the Secretary of Agriculture says is safeand that is what the proponents of repeal of section 104 are requestingthat we wait until later in the season to do it.

At the present time there is ko Reserve volunteering. This means that in the event of another emergency we will call again upon the veteran who is a reservistupon the man who has already done 2 years of duty under the draft. But. more important. it means that since the Army is taking almost all draftees. it is the one service which is making some progress in building up its Reserves. The Air Force and the Navy still depend upon volunteers who are not required to go into the Reserve components and. consequently. these two branches of servicethe Navy and the Air Forceare not getting any Reserves. and the day may soon be at hand when these two great departments of our national defense wake up to find themselves stripped of Reserve organization.

Mississippi. and Alabama have dramatically brought to the attention of all of us the great need of doing something. if at all possible. to more fully protect the lives of persons and property. from the fury of such disasters. My own State of Oklahoma is often the victim of such storms. For quite a long while I have been making a study along this line and have come to the conclusion that something definite can be done. According to information furnished me by the United States Department of Commerce Weather Bureau on February 27. and again on March 7. this year. if more funds are provided by Congress. effective service in this regard can be rendered relative to research. investigations. and warnings of approaching storms. It is my understanding that it has been established that various weather phenomena may be successfully detected by means of radar and a more dense network of rawinsondeupperair soundingand surface stations. Funds necessary to implement all phases of this program total at least $2.500.000 which would be small. indeed. to help prevent the loss of lives and property. Also. I believe there should be an authorization that would permit the Weather Bureau to accept other than Federal funds to assist in supporting this important program. Therefore. if I have the opportunity to do so. at the proper time. I expect to offer before the proper committee. or the House. or both. an amendment to the current Department of Commerce appropriation bill which. in substance. will read: Tornado investigations and warnings. Weather Bureau: For necessary expenses in carrying out the purposes of Public Law 657. Eightieth Congress. .enacted June 16. 1948. $2.500.000: Provided. That the Secretary of Commerce is authorized to cooperate with State and local governments. institutions of learning. and private individuals and corporations and in this connection to receive and administer funds contributed for the object of investigating tornadoes and other severe storms and for developing and testing methods of forecasting such storms and disseminating timely warnings thereof. Funds so received may be credited to this appropriation. which appropriation will remain available until expended.

Everyone recognizes that the widespread corruption in the executive branch of the Government must be exposed and weeded out. Even President Truman conceded this in his stateoftheunion message. Second. The American people will not have confidence that the Executive can honestly and completely investigate itself. Third. The Department of Justice. Itself under investigation for its past failure to enforce the law and prevent the growth of favoritism and influence and corruption which has been revealed by congressional committees. is disqualified. Fourth. Newbold Morris. by his performance before the Hoey committee and his involvement in tanker deals. has exposed his unfitness as corruption cleanerupper. Fifth. The American people expect their Representatives in Congress. which is. or should be. independent of the executive branch. to conduct a thorough. impartial. penetrating examination of the activities of corrupt officials in the executive branch of the Government.

But. there was one issue on which we did agree. which meant more to the economic welfare of the American people than almost any other issue that has yet confronted this generation. That was the development and distribution of the water power of this Nation at rates the people could afford to pay. Mr. Ickes. as Secretary of the Interior. was strongly in favor of the development of such great streams as the Columbia River. I joined him in that fight. When the time came to distribute the power at Bonneville. he called me over the telephone and asked me if I would object to selling the power at Bonneville at a cheaper rate than that at which the power was being sold in the Tennessee Valley area. He said that the Bonneville power could be sold economically for less than was being paid for power produced by the Tennessee Valley Authority. which I had helped to create. being coauthor with Senator Norris of the bill to create the TVA. I told him by all means to see that it was sold at the lowest rate that was commensurate with sound investment. In other words. I did not want to see it sold at a loss. I wanted it sold at the lowest possible rate it could be sold at without the Government sustaining a loss. With that beginning. there has been the greatest development of that great northwestern country that anybody dreamed of a quarter of a century ago. It is due in great measure to the efforts of Harold L. Ickes. He started the program of distributing the power generated on the Columbia River at rates the people of that great northwestern section could afford to pay. If all the rest of the people of this country got their power at the Bonneville rates they would save more than $2.000.000.000 a year on their light and power bills.",

Just let me read to you a letter received from a very prominent and patriotic businessman of my community. in which he refers to and encloses a newspaper story of what appears to be extravagant. excessive. and wasteful expenditures: Enclosed is a clipping from the morning paper which has startled me and everyone who has read it. Currently. it is the principal topic of conversation on the street here. Most of the people believe nothing will be done about it. but I argued that you and a few others like yourself will see that something is done. Therefore. to back up my statement. please let me know what Is done by Congress to correct this situation. He is certainly entitled to ask that Congress do something about this situation. I am happy that the Joint Committee of the Congress on Atomic Energy has already held open public hearings and has promised to get to the bottom of this apparent reckless expenditure of public funds. I am hopeful that the committee will recommend legislation which will prevent a recurrence. From the best information available to me. I find that the Atomic Energy Commission can get the very best plumbers in the area I represent at a wage rate which will amount to around $100 for a regular 5day weeknot $700. And this man who worked for around $100 a week has to pay the taxes out of which the $700 a week plumber is paid. Mr. Speaker. the American people do not ask us to reduce our defense. but they have every right to expect us to reduce the cost of defense.

This organization which has been granted a Federal charter by Congress has as its purpose to train boys for citizenship and to help them to develop into men of character. Over 19.000.000 American men and boys have had this training. and these former Scouts have stated again and again that their Scout training has been invaluable in their later life. The movement is open to every American boy who is 8 years of age no matter where he lives. who his father was or what race or creed the boy belongs to. This year the Boy Scouts are inaugurating a 3year program. It has certain definite objectives which time does not permit me to enumerate. These objectives are aimed at the boys themselves. the Scout movement and the Nation. The slogan of the program is \"Forward on libertys team\" and every one of the members is going to do his best to achieve the goals of public service. patriotism. and democracy which have been set. I am sure that a patriotic citizens we all wish the Scouts well in their praiseworthy undertaking. I hope that we can do more than merely extend good wishes. If we lend our support and leadership to them in our home community we can help them in a very effective way to do the job which they have undertaken.",

The Republican vote was 28 for 12 against. The Democrat vote was 21 for. 23 against. Is not it wonderful how a lie can be repeated so often that it becomes accepted as the truth?

In the final vote (March 19. 1920) .on the Treaty of Versailles. into which the League of Nations was incorporated. the Senate lined up as follows: Ayes. 49 (21 Democrats. 28 Republicans). nays. 35 (23 Democrats. 12 Republicans). Since the aye vote was seven less than the required twothirds majority of those present. the treaty and the League were rejected.",

The case in which that doctrine was first announced was Martin against Waddell. Someone mistakenly stated that the Pollard case first laid down that doctrine. The Pollard case was the first case that decided that new States had the same rights as the original 13 States. insofar as their State sovereignty was concerned. but the case of Martin against Waddell decided that the States were sovereign when they won their independence from the Crown. and that on the theory that they possessed sovereignty. they owned the beds of tidewaters. That was the language which was used at the time. and the tidewater rule was then applied in later decisions to waters which were not at all affected by the tide. waters such as rivers and streams and lakes inside the United States. Therefore. the junior Senator from Louisiana feels that the rule of law and the theory that the States originally possessed sovereignty was what placed them in the ownership of the beds of their streams and and their tidewaters. I realize that the argument is made by my very able friend from Wyoming that the States never claimed this property. though that is a matter of opinion. and that the citizens were fishing on that property. which had been included in their colonial charters.

I wish to state that I am not in favor of permitting Members of Congress to deduct costofliving expenses in Washington from their incometax returns. I appreciate that the circumstances under which we have had to operate during the last few days in the closing hours of this session of Congress made it absolutely impossible to get proper consideration of this matter. It was the. Seventyninth Congress. under the control of the Democrats. that put through a bill giving the Members of Congress a $2.500 taxfree expense allowance. Last year the House voted to rescind the taxfree provision of this law. This year the House voted to write into the legislative appropriations bill a provision allowing the Members of Congress to deduct all costofliving expenses while in Washington from their incometax returns. the same as representatives of business concerns. This amendment was offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts. the majority leader. Mr. JOHN MCCORMACK. The Senate struck this provision from the appropriations bill. It was finally compromised by permitting a deduction of $3.C00 for costofliving allowance in Washington. According to my understanding of the conference report. this Is a fiat sum deductible regardless of the actual cost. This is certainly an improvement over the House bill inasmuch as it puts a limitation on the amount that can be deducted. My principal reason for opposing this type of legislation is that when a man files his candidacy for Congress he knows the salary and remuneration he will receive for his services. There is no doubt but that a great many Members of Congress serve the people of their districts at a tremendous sacrifice to themselves. Nevertheless. Mr. Speaker. legislation of this kind should never be enacted until proper and extensive hearings have been held. Then. if. in the judgment of the majority of the Members. they feel they should have some financial consideration. it should be done by increasing salaries and not by tax exemption features",

My argument is this: Regardless of whether estate and gift taxes are pretty rough on the person who has to pay them. the fact remains that if we raise corporate taxes and individual income taxes and do not touch estate and gift taxes we will not bring up the tax floor equitably. We may bring up the living room side of it. or the dining room side of it. but we would leave the kitchen side down. We must bring up that part of it. too. That was my argument on capital gains. The amendments placed in the law regarding estate and gift taxes resulted in a substantial reduction in revenue. We have lost a considerable amount of revenue. If it were not for the 1948 amendments it is estimated that we could raise $600.000.000.",

Are we going to revise our gift and estate taxes in the wealthiest nation of the worldI repeat. Mr. President. in the wealthiest nation in the worldor are we going to put excise taxes on manufactured items? What kind of items are they? For example. an excise tax is levied on the 18 items which are included in the pages which have been printed in the RECORD. Let us take vacuum cleaners. Who generally buys the vacuum cleaner? It is bought by the average American citizen. My family bought one very recently. It does seem to be very equitable. since we are really pulling hard to get the revenue for our defense efforts. to have at least some increase in estate and gift taxes rather than have Mrs. Jones pay a little excise tax on an electric vacuum cleaner.

We were surprised to learn that there were some 12 or 15 architectengineers on that project. and we think that with that many. and with careful screening of those plans and specifications. we can save some money.",

The rebirth of Israel as a modern and independent state is now gradually becoming such an event. It all still seems like it happened yesterdaythe great struggle with Britain. the emotional strain when the matter was up before the United Nations. United States recognition of Israels independence. the invasion of Israel by the neighboring Arab States. and later the largescale Jewish immigration and the efforts to solve the countrys economic problemsnevertheless. 4 years have elapsed since that eventful day in 1948 when Israels independence was proclaimed. Four years may be but a fleeting moment in the annals of human history. but for Israel it represents a whole epoch in which a people regained its nationhood on its ancient and ancestral soil. During this time it has established itself as a democratic state. its people have on several occasions reiterated their faith in freedom. its industry and agriculture have grown tremendously. and its population has more than doubled through the admission of hundreds of thousands of homeless and persecuted people who found a haven of refuge within its borders. If Israel is given the financial assistance which is essential to the full development of its potential resourcesparticularly its great mineral wealthits people will be enabled to solve their economic problems and also contribute to the growing strength of the free world. As Israel enters the fifth year of its independence. the fullest possible moral and material aid we can give her will help secure its economic foundations and encourage these stanch friends of this country to stand shoulder to shoulder with us in the struggle for freedom. democracy. and human dignity. I salute the Government and the people of Israel on the fourth anniversary of their national independence and extend to them my best wishes for their happiness. peace. and prosperity.",

I asked the Forest Service and. of course. they being interested in the forests. naturally feel they can help in lots of places by getting possession and ownership of land. but they could not tell me of a single instance where they had gotten rid of any land they ever owned. except where they exchanged it. in which case they usually got more acreage than they gave up.

The blue room actually consists of three large offices. plus an entrance lobby from which the Johnson entourage will be able to view an outer office through a beautiful archway. which is a rarity even in the Pentagon. The main office is painted in what one painter called infantry blue. explaining that it is similar to the scarves worn by the famed ceremonial Third Infantry Regiment at Fort Meyer. The outer rooms are done in a lighter tone of blue. To bring about this miracle workmen tore out several partitions and built new ones.

My distinguished friend. the Senator from Illinois spoke accurately when he said that if one wishes to be a good politician. he should vote for all appropriations and vote against all taxes. Mr. President. it is not a pleasant thing to vote for taxes. but I am willing to assume my responsibility and to vote for this bill. I voted against the committee in a few instances because I felt we should raise more revenue. but simply because my position was not sustained I am not going to vote against the passage of the bill this evening. I am willing to stand here and share my part of the responsibility with the committee. I believe the Senate knows full well that the committee had a most difficult job. It is easy to criticize the committee. it is easy to criticize the Senate. but no one could write a tax bill which would win either the approval of all Members nor of all taxpayers. So. Mr. President. I am going to support the committee. The bill before us now for final action raises urgently needed revenue. it does it as fairly as possible under all the circumstances and difficulties.

I am sure that every Member of this body wants expenses cut if that can be done without jeopardizing the national security. However. Mr. President. manifestly any major cut in expenses. such as is envisaged in the suggestion of the .Senator from Indiana. will mean a cut of great depth and of major impact to the defense program. At the present time we have in our budget only $9.500.000.000 for items outside of the defense program. the interest on the public debt. and the veterans program. Even with the passage of this tax bill. present forecasts indicate a deficit of approximately $9.500.000.000 or $10.000.000.000. Thus. we would have to do two things in order to achieve a balance between expenditures and income: We would have to pass this tax bill. and then we would have to abolish every department and agency of the Federal Government and every activity of the Federal Government apart from veterans activities. interest on the public debt. and our defense budget.

I agree with the distinguished majority leader and with previous expressions by the Senator from Minnesota and other Senators. that this bill will not raise sufficient revenue. even though I also agree with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee that there are other ways to control inflation besides taxation. I voted for many amendments to the bill which were rejected. and these votes indicate criticisms against the bill. which I feel are warranted. But the Federal Government needs the money which is to be raised by the bill. and I do not think we should reject it because it does not raise sufficient revenue. and the fact that it could be improved. even greatly improved. is no reason. in my judgment. for voting against it. I am sure the distinguished Senator from Georgia and every other member of the Finance Committee know there never has been a tax bill which could not be improved. Tax legislation. Mr. President. seems to me the most complex legislation on which we must pass. and that is why the work of the Finance Committee is so onerous and difficult as well as so important. Every change in a tax bill affects many other provisions in the bill. Many men spend years and years of their lives in an effort to comprehend the complex problems surrounding tax legislation without arriving at an understanding of them. I suggest that the proper vote for my esteemed friends from New York. Minnesota. Illinois. and Oregon. in line with their feelings expressed on the floor. if they cannot support the bill as I think they should support it. would be to vote \"present.\" The Senator from New York will recall our experience with that kind of a vote on the Defense Production Act.

The effect of the amendment would be. as I said. to limit expenditure of funds appropriated in this act for personal service to 75 percent of the amount requested by the President in his budget estimates to pay employees whose functions are those of publicity experts and their assistants. and those engaged in related supporting activities. such as typing. mimeographing. mailing. and so forth.

That law was passed on October 22. 1913. It is chapter 32. paragraph 1. Thirtyeighth Statutes. page 212. * The Byrd amendment is merely a limitation on the amount of the budget estimate. so the specific 75 percent is already determined. No determination is necessary to be made in the carrying out of the provisions of the amendment. I hope the ruling of the Chair will be that this is not legislation. because it could be part and parcel of section 603. which provides the same kind of a limitation.

I notice in the report. on page 14. you state that the uncommitted lending authority in the sum of $10.500OCO will be recaptured. You also stated that the committee requested the Administrator to refrain from committing the Government to further loans prior to the enactment of this bill. I wish to state that the Knox Corp. in my district has been quite successful and has done more building. especially in the prefabricated field. than anybody else. paying off the loans as they mature. making good profits for themselves. and satisfying their customers. In the course of the defensemobilization program. we have urgent needs for prefabricated housing or housing components. For example. the Hbomb plant construction in the Savannah River area will require upward of 35.000 construction workers. Obviously. the construction of these large defense installations creates an extreme shortage of construction workers in the area. while. at the same time. they have urgent needs for housing. Prefabricated houses can be of particular assistance in meeting defense housing needs in such cases. because of the speed with which they can be furnished. the fact that skilled site labor is minimized. and the ease of controlling. without timeconsuming and costly onsite inspection. the quality of basic structural work on the houses. They can be erected at the site with savings of up to 80 percent of onsite construction labor required for the conventional construction of housing entirely at the site. Also. while a high percentage of the labor required for conventional house construction is skilled labor. a high percentage of the labor required for tue erection of prefabricated houses on the site may be semiskilled or unskilled. This is also true of the labor requirements in the plant of the prefabricatedhouse manufacturer. Knox Corp. has made an application and it is in process now for $1.750.000. I would like to know if that application and some other applications will be affected. It is my understanding that the committee did not intend Its request to refrain from making new loans to apply to additional loans to these existing borrowers. and that the chairman has so advised Mr. Foley.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. there is nothing complex about this amendment. it simply restores the amount to that which was appropriated last year. with an approximate 10 percent cut. I do not believe I can improve upon the statement made by the gentleman from Florida . yesterday. when he called attention to this subject. He said in part on page 4811 of the RECORD: The $300.000 increase in this item Is 20 percent more than was appropriated last year for the same purpose. It provides for 35 additional employees in fiscal 1952. more travel money. and more odds and ends of expenses. where we had hoped to see savings. If you break it down to a per capita basis. it means that this is going to take the tax payments of many persons each year for this one item of increased cost of government. Now. Mr. Chairman. I want to read Into the RECORD a statement made by President Truman himself on February 21. 1951. in a speech at a breakfast meeting of Masonic leaders in Washington. D. C. Listen to what President Truman said: Everybody. I dont care who he is or what his condition or what his position isfrom the President of the United States to the laborer who digs in the trenchmust make some sacrifice in order that the whole country may be mobilized. Now. if the President means what he says and says what he means there could be no objection to knocking off this $300.000 that has been added this year. with an approximate 10percent cut. Is it too much to expect the President of the United States to set the pace for economy. sacrifice and belttightening about which he preaches at every opportunity?",

When we send an appropriation over to the President calling for funds to run the House of Representatives and to run the offices of the Members of this House. the President does not cut those funds. There is a good reason for that rule. Mr. Chairman. there is an appropriation here for $1.883.615 for the President to run his Executive offices for the fiscal year 1952.

I take this time to point out here something which I pointed out in the committee. while the President has been in the White House since 1947 the cost of the staff has risen from $452.000 a year to $1.883.615. That is not the only item. The item of care of the White House grounds has risen in that time from $150.000 to $315.000 for next year. which is on the basis of $350.000 for a full year. The other items which come with the White House request are for the Council of Economic Advisers. the budget. and the renovation of the White House. When you come to this item you will vote for it or you will vote against it. and I am not at the moment either speaking for or against it. but I am calling attention to the fact that the President made an earnest appeal for economy to the Congress. but in the only five items in the budget which come directly under his jurisdiction. there was not one dollar cut from any one of those five items. and I felt. as some people on the floor probably feel. that if it had only been a matter of psychology it would have been better for a man in such high position asking economy of the country and of the Congress to have set an example by cutting the five items that come out from his own immediate office.",

I offer It to bring to your attention how very difficult it is for Members of the Congress to intelligently vote on matters such as the appropriations for the Atomic Energy Commission. In the report issued by the committee. page 5. they call to the attention of the House a small but typical example of uncontrolled spending in connection with the construction of a hospital for the care of dogs and other animals at Los Alamos. N. Mex. During last years hearings it .was stated the cost of the hospital should have been $59.000. but instead it cost $85.000. If you will refer to the hearings and the discussion between the members of the committee and the people who appeared in behalf .of the bill. you will be informed that the committee expressed considerable opposition and doubt about the proposed construction of a dog sanitarium at Los Alamos. However. the Commission. notwithstanding opposition of the committee. did construct the hospital at a cost of $85.000. They had a few dogs there. and laterso the hearings gorented it to a veterinarian for $150 a month. That is disgusting and ridiculous. There are hundreds and thousands of young Americans who served their country and who are standing in line to get into a hospital. Notwithstanding our love and affection for dogs and cats. is it not ridiculous that a commission. whose actions are so secret that they cannot even explain to the Members of Congress. should spend $85.000 for a cat and dog hospital.",

In a special election in December 1931 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Representative Ernest R. Ackerman. Percy Hamilton Stewart. of Plainfield. N. J.. was elected to represent the old Fifth District which then comprised the county of Morris as well as the county of Union. On June 20. Mr. Stewart died at the age of 84 years. While Mr. Stewart served in the House for but a short time. he is remembered by his colleagues with affection and respect. Though a lifelong Democrat. he was a person of independent character who frequently supported measures of the then Republican administration. A member of the Committee on Bankingand Currency. his maiden speech was in support of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation bill. Mr. Stewarts service in the House was but one incident in a life of activity in civic and public service. He served as mayor of Plainfield from 1913 to 1915. the only Democrat to hold that office for many years. During World War I. Mr. Stewart was New Jersey chairman of the Military Training Camps Association. chairman of the State examining committee for the Central Officers Training School and .civilian aide to the adjutant general. He served on the State board of education in 1919 and 1920 and on the State highway commission from 1923 to 1929. Mr. Stewart was a former chairman of the Union County Democratic Committee and was a delegate in 1920 to the Democratic National Convention. In 1932 he was Democratic candidate for the office of United States Senator from New Jersey. being defeated in that election by the late W. Warren Barbour in a spectacularly close election. Mr. Stewart was born in Newark. N. J.. on February 10. 1867. He was graduated from Yale in 1890 and received his bachelor of laws degree from Columbia University in 1893. Shortly thereafter. he was admitted to the New York bar. Mr. Stewarts death removes from his home community of Plainfield a most distinguished citizen.

In the Production Act of 1950 we had provided for the requisitioning of supplies or component parts thereof on materials and facilities necessary for the manufacture. servicing. or operation of equipment. supply and component parts as needed for the national defense. We made provision also that where real estate was requisitioned that the owner of the real estate. after the Government had gotten through with the property. would have a priority to repurchase the property upon terms and conditions agreed upon between the owner and the Government. The oversight was that we did not mention real estate. The nearest we came to it was authorizing the requisitioning of facilities. and facilities might or might not have been real property. We added a new provision. the effect of which is to classify the property which can be requisitioned as personal property and the property which is condemned as real property. and setting up the provision under which real property might be condemned. I think the committee in overcoming the oversight has done the same sort of a job that we intended to do last year. so that there is no question now but that we requisition personal property and we condemn real property. of course. under the standards set up in the act.",

They testified before us. as you will find in the hearings. that they have practically completed the sifting of the present employees of Government. All they have to do now is to check new applicants. They check these by going around to the FBI and the Committee on UnAmerican r1951 Activities. and various other groups. and checking to see if there is anything on record against an applicant. At present they have 708 loyalty boards throughout the country and they intend to increase that number to 1.222. They want 348 inspectors to handle these boards. They want 14 or more regional boards of appeal. Much of this machinery is set up. not for the purpose of testing the loyalty of the applicants. but to give the applicants a chance to appeal if they are not given employment. My point is that the time has come when. if there is any doubt about a persons loyalty. we should simply refuse to give him a job and not spend a lot of money investigating him further. On that point you will note in the press. and I am quoting: Last week the President tightened up the loyalty standards for Government jobs by making it possible to dismiss or refuse to hire an employee for reasonable doubt of loyalty. instead of requiring reasonable evidence of disloyalty.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the purpose of this amendment is to restore to the five agencies of the Government administering the displacedpersons program the approximate amount that was returned to the Treasury of the United States last year because of the inability of the Displaced Persons Commission to fully carry out its program. particularly with regard to the German expellees. The operation was very materially interfered with by virtue of the fact that much of the shipping that was being utilized was diverted from the Atlantic to transport the Turkish and Greek troops to Korea. In addition to that. the Attorney General had placed an interpretation on the Internal Security Act that made it impossible for many people who had been merely casual members of the Nazi organization to qualify for admission to the United States. In considering this appropriation it is important to bear in mind the fact that there are two phases of this program. one dealing with IRO displaced persons and the second with expellees. the expellees being persons of German ethnic origin. That program has just about started. The various civic and church groups in the United States have assurances for many of these people. over 40.000 of whom are or will soon be processed for resettlement in the United States. I should like to call your attention to the figures that cannot be disputed: Of the money appropriated. $1.100.000 under the law is needed for loans to defray inland transportation. as authorized by the statute. $4.375.000 is the cost of ocean transportation of German expellees at $125 a person. In that connection I would like to call your attention to the fact that the IRO displaced persons were transported by the International Refugee Organization. That organization has nothing to do with the transportation of these German expellees. Seven hundred thousand dollars is required to liquidate the program which expires on June 30. 1952. That. leaves just $20.000 with which to conduct this operation for the next fiscal year. and that. quite obviously. is impossible.",

These people have been waiting for the opportunity to come to the places that have been provided for them by the American sponsors. If it is the purpose of this committee to do something to prevent the carrying out of this program designed to take care of these German expellees. it seems to me that the decent way to do it is to offer an amendment to the Displaced Persons Act and eliminate that part of the program. But the insistence in both bodies that something be done to relieve the suffering of these Germans was so great that they were included in this program. and that phase of the program cannot be carried out with this appropriation. It might be interesting to know that the D. P. Commissioners are not typical bureaucrats. One of them is a former labor union official. another was connected with welfare work in New York. and the third was the head of Catholic welfare in New York. These people do not know how to pad appropriations.

I hold the report in my hand. It is the report on H. R. 7005. the House version of the mutual security bill. I read from page 30 of the report. The heading reads: \"Mutual security funds available in 1952. obligations and expenditures to February 29. 1952.\" Under \"Expenditure data\" for military assistance. I read: Total available for expenditure. 1952. $10.817.260.805. Unexpended balance. February 29. 1952. $9.471.537.373.

The distinguished Senator from Idaho has said by his amendment we are giving back $225.000.000 which the House cut from the bill. However. Mr. President. we are not giving back anything on the basis of what the committee which heard the evidence sought to have authorized. The $225.000.000 figure is arrived at on the basis of the action voted on the floor of the House. but not on the basis of the action taken by the House committee. On our side of the Capitol. the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has said that a cut of $1.000.000.000 is enough. and the Senate Armed Forces Committee has said that a cut of $1.000.000.000 is enough.

I realize that the State Department has brought upon itself the opposition which has developed in this body both among those who support the pending amendment and among those on the committee who voted for a cut of $1.000.000.000.

They have misled the Senate. they have misled the Congress. and they have misled the American people on vital phases of our foreign policy where there was no excuse for not telling the truth. That is one of the major reasons why a cut has been recommended by the committee and why other cuts have been suggested. as. for instance. the one by the proponents of the pending amendment. Nevertheless we must recognize that the struggle in which we are engaged is worldwide in character and that we cannot contemplate the defenses of the United States apart from the defenses of our allies abroad. If the purpose of this bill were to help the recipients of our aid purely from a humanitarian standpoint we could safely vote for the cut proposed by the amendment and more. too. If its purpose were solely to enable them to defend themselves. we could vote for the cut. But I consider this to be a bill for the defense of the United States.

Before that time. in 1945and that was only a few years agowe heard passionate pronouncements about what the United Nations Organization was going to do for suffering mankind.

After the United Nations came the Marshall plan. and we have been hearing about it in one guise or another ever since we adopted it.

This committee doubts the latter statement. In the opinion of this committee this is a part of the Nations foreign policy and. since it does not represent a domestic agricultural program in any way. the committee feels that it should be considered as a part of our international budget rather than a responsibility charegable to the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Chairman. I feel it is my duty to point out that the whole history of the negotiation and ratification of the agreement indicates that the foregoing conclusion is incorrect. The agreement was designed primarily to benefit the economy of the United States and especiallyto aid our wheat producers. It was thought that it might involve substantial expenditures by this Government. but it was recognized that with our domestic price support program for wheat. export subsidies to dispose of surplus supplies would be necessary even in the absence of an agreement. The views of the Department of Agriculture and of the large farm organizations to this effect were set forth clearly in the hearings before a subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee in May 1949 when ratification of the agreement was under consideration.",

In response to the consideration propounded by Mr. SHORT Of Missouri. I stated that I was certain that the best laboratories in the world have been made available to us in our fight against this disease. Notwithstanding the fact that all of the best scientists in the world and the best laboratories in the world have been available to us. and notwithstanding the further fact that we have expended an enormous amount of money. neither a cure nor a preventive has been discovered or provided. If properly equipped laboratories are already in existence. one might naturally wonder why it is necessary for us to spend $25.000.000 in building another laboratory. Especially is this true since all nations have a community interest in the problems involved. I am neither a medical man nor a scientist and I therefore do not know just what is needed. I do know. however. that frequently scientists and medical men meet with insurmountable obstacles in their efforts to be of service and of value to their fellow man. The building of a laboratory is one thing. the discovery of a remedy or a preventive is quite another thing. You might have the best laboratories possible. but if you do not have men of scientific learning. skilled in the arts of research. the laboratories. however wonderful. will be of little value. Bucket brigades have put out many fires where modern firefighting equipment was not available. If we are to really fight the fire of Aftosa. let us call out the bucket brigadesyes. even the little men of scienceand give them a chance to make their contribution. If we provided the money for the building of this laboratory. it would not be ready for occupancy for perhaps 18 months or 2 years. and by that time Canada and perhaps our own Government will have spent additional millions. I hope that we will delay this matter until the House Committee on Agriculture can give further consideration to all aspects of all of the problems involved.",

I recognize the menace of the footandmouth disease just as well as anyone in the House. I was chairman of the Committee on Appropriations when the thing broke out in Mexico. and had a great deal to do with it. We held hearings for days and days. The House passed this authorization bill for a lab_ oratory and these people came up before the Committee on Appropriations with the most fantastic plans for spending money and building a laboratory that you can imagine. It was entirely out of line. and after we had gone over it thoroughly the small amount. comparatively. that you have heard about. $500.000. was provided. We hoped that with that fund they might be able to find a site where it could be built. and where some results could be attained. and that then the whole thing could be brought before the committee with an intelligent plan so that we might proceed constructively with something toward getting rid of that dread disease. I am going to suggest this. and I hope that the chairman of the subcommittee will go along with me. that we indicate to the Secretary of Agriculture that we would like to have him come up and talk to the subcommittee and indicate a plan for the job and for the type of laboratory that might be built. Now this idea of going at a thing of this kind with $24.500.000. and going at it blind. Is not the way to get good results and a good laboratory.

Delegate Dr. Philip Jessup because \"He is rather sympathetic to unAmericans.\" Vishinsky digressed from his main argument on the Soviet peace package before the United Nations main political committee to touch on the Jessup issue. \"If I were called to testify.\" he said. \"I would testify that he is a most arrant defender of the American way of life. which has been embodied in the Atlantic bloc. \"I must express my sympathy for Jessup.\" Mr. President. since we are considering diplomatic appointments.

Obviously. if Mr. Jessup is satisfactory to Vishinsky and to Russia he cannot be satisfactory to the United States. The two simply cannot go together. To me it is one of the best proofs. if any more proof were needed. of the unfitness of Mr. Jessup for the position he holds. when Vishinsky. speaking for Soviet Russia attempts to criticize 38 Republican Senators and stands up for Mr. Jessup. In this we see a low level in the conduct of our international affairs. If I were President of the United States I would send a cablegram to Mr. Jessup to board a plane tonight and start for home.

The resolution introduced by our colleague the gentleman from New York calls for a congressional investigation of the Department of Justice and the office of Attorney General by a subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary. We feel that no selfinvestigation. no matter how conscientious or how vigorously carried out. can restore the necessary public confidence in that Department so vital to our very basic institutions in this country.",

We must take into consideration the fact that men who are working for the Government and who have long records of honorable discharge of their duties in the public interest will. in the furtherance of that sense of duty. write leases which will protect the Government. If any leases are written that appear to be lacking in administrative discretion. certainly they will be brought to the attention of this committee very quickly and we will see that such leases are improved. I point out that the Administrator of General Services under existing law has at this time all the power necessary to make these leases and to write such conditions in them as are in the best interest of the Government. He will continue to have the same powers that he has now. and there will be this addition. that it will be optional on the part of the Government to take over these properties at the termination of the lease. in place of leaving them In the hands of the owners.

The proposed amendment is. as was stated before. section (e) of the bill which was passed by the Senate. with the addition of the provision that if the agreement calls for the expenditure of more than $50.000 a year then it shall either come to the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments for approval or at least be submitted to that committee before the deal is made. I am not concerned particularly about the amount. whether it is $50.000 a year or $100.000 a year. It should be some fixed amount. I think. so as to save the legislative committee from being required to police small agreements where the expenditure is one that we might call a nominal sum. But it does seem. and I will not prolong the debate. that there should be some restriction. and that the restriction should properly be in the hands of the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments. which wrote the bill. I call on my colleagues on the majority side now to give support to an amendment which will retain jiurisdiction for our committee instead of letting its supervision go to some other committee. We all concede that there is unexcusable waste and extravagance and some think worse in the executive departments. We all concede the necessity of economy. This seems to be the best we can do at this particular session of the Congress. to grant this power hoping that the administrative agency will exercise some degree of judgment. and some common sense. and that then the committee retaining that power. the very retention of the power. will tend to make the administrative agency more conservative in what it does.",

The report of the committee on H. R. 7005 states on page 7: The justification for continuing substantial United States expenditures for foreign assistance is the maintenance of the security of the United States. In determining how much to spend and the way such expenditures should be made. an appraisal of the current danger from Soviet aggression is essential. There has been no decrease in the danger of Soviet aggression. The United States must not relax in its defense efforts and our one hope for the avoidance of an allout war is in becoming so strong that the potential enemy will not dare to launch an attack upon us. The fundamental principle of the Mutual Security Act is to augment the strength of the free world. This can be accomplished through our aid and by the selfhelp and the cooperation of the recipient nations. Our investment in foreign affairs is exceedingly high and in continuing to make available assistance. it is imperative to have assurance that all possible efforts will be exercised by those who are receiving our aid to strengthen themselves as rapidly as possible. We are engaged in a worldwide struggle for survival. The unstable international situation is the result of the unwillingness and the absolute refusal of the Soviet Union to cooperate in establishing a peaceful and stable international society. The Kremlin in its vicious policies of expansion and domination is seeking to tyrannize the earth. It is necessary. therefore. for the free world to gird itself to meet this growing danger. and to protect ourselves from being overrun by aggressive militant international communism. Our trouble today is a direct result of the policies of the Kremlin. We are in the process of strengthening ourselves and strengthening our allies to meet this growing danger.",

As various bills have come before us from time to time to increase the number of Federal judges. the argument has been made by those opposing the bills. including the present speaker. that the business of the Federal courts would be considerably reduced if efforts were made to increase the jurisdictional limit. Now. it appears. as the chairman of our committee has indicated. the civil cases involving private litigants are on an average about three times longer than the Government civil cases. and much longer normally than the criminal cases. Thus to whatever extent we can cut down on those. it should lessen the constant pressure upon us to increase the number of Federal judges throughout the country. It appears that a raise in the jurisdictional limit from $3.000 to $10.000 would eliminate 39 percent of the present contract cases between private litigants. and would eliminate 13 percent of the personal injury cases. Of course. It is a fact that in personal injury cases in a great many Instances the plaintiff might well ask for an amount over the jurisdictional limit. even though we raised it and thereby vitiate to a degree the advantage gained by this change. If the limit is increased to only $7.500. as has been suggested. that would eliminate 33 percent of the purely contract cases. and only 11 percent of the personal injury cases. In numbers. it is estimated that the increase to $7.500 would reduce the number of cases 2.690 in the various Federal Vourts. An increase to $10.000 would eliminate 3.181 of those cases. There is no point in repeating in detail the argument so ably advanced by. our chairman with regard to the reduction in the value of the dollar. and the fact that today $10.000 is certainly no more than was $3.000 when that jurisdictional limit was set.

I sincerely hope the committee will follow the suggestion that will be made by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary that this amendment be accepted. I think it would be utterly wrong for me to stand here and suggest that this jurisdictional amount be not raised at all. By the same token. I think it is going a little too far to raise it 3 Y3 times. The amendment I have offered would increase this jurisdictional amount 2 /2 times. I call your attention to the fact that this distinguished committee of judges recommended $7.500. I do not think they did it on the basis of statistics. Sometimes we here in the Congress are carried away by statistics and forget that our job is to do justice. I believe the recommendation of those judges fixing the amount at $7.500 was made for good reasons. I think that we should follow their recommendation. If increasing the amount 2 times is not enough. the Congress can later consider it. Why cannot we fix it at this lesser amount now and see how it works out for a few years? This jurisdictional limit started at $500. it was raised. it went back once. and now it is $3.000. The point I am trying to make is this: Those of us who represent a rural area find a more conservative economy. We do not deal in such large amounts. The Federal courts should not be closed to us. Our job is not to take all work away from the Federal courts. it is to do justice. Ten thousand dollars is too high for a rural area. These rural people are not responsible for the fact that the dockets in Federal courts are cluttered up. We in the Congress must share the blame not alone for the inflation. but the fact that we have increased the jurisdiction and the scope of the Government of the United States. and increased taxes and done all of these other things which have added a workload to every -department of Government.",

It will also amend the Social Security Act to raise minimum benefits from $20 to $30 a month. The legislation would cost about one and threefourths billion dollars. This legislation can be financed by closing a few of the tax loopholes which amount to a loss In Federal tax revenues of about $5.000.000.000 annually. Eight hundred million now paid to the States by the Federal Government for public assistance could be saved and would help to pay for about half of the cost of the legislation I am proposing. Furthermore. the cost of the program would go down each year as the number of those not insured dwindle. The inadequacy of public assistance in many States is an indication of our lack of concern for our old people. There is no justification for the plight of deserving old folks when we are able to help the world and to pile up surpluses. even when so large a part of our material and human resources are being used for defense. It is time to look at this problem realistically. Let us put an end to shame lists and embarrassment for our old people and put a little sunshine into their lives in their twilight years.

I found that a large amount of money had been spent on the* buildings that the colonel. who is commanding officer of the base. readily described to us. After the Army takes over a base there is no new construction. It is all rehabilitation. So the $27.000 that was spent there was not for new construction. in Army language. It was for rehabilitation. I have with me now pictures that were taken showing that in our language there is new construction.

I am telling you it was built in 1929.\" So it was built in 1929. according to the colonel. Upon questioning the colonel. he said. \"There has been no money spent down here since we took it from the Indians.\" Those were his exact words. I believe. and I am sure that I quote him. he said. \"There has been no money spent down here since we took it from the Indians.\" That was in one breath. and about two breaths later he said. \"Well. we got about $411.000 for rehabilitation down here.\" I noticed that General Brooks on Saturday night said that they had spent $1.601. maybe more. on rehabilitating the lodge. But yet at first General Brooks said there was nothing ever spent here. Somebody is mistaken. Was it nothing? Was it $1.600? Was it $411.000? I still say it was $27.000. at least. and probably a lot more that was spent down there. As I said the other day. it is a magnificent and beautiful lodge. nine bedrooms. nine bathrooms.

Mr. Achesons law firm represented the Soviet government of Poland at a time when the Polish pdlice state was being set up. and it was seeking a loan from the United States. At that time. cf course. Mr. Acheson was Acting Secretary of State temporarily away from his firm. but as Acting Secretary of State he approved the loan that helped to set up the Red police in Poland. This approval of Achesons was despite the earnest pleas of our Ambassador in Poland. Arthur Bliss Lane. to turn down this loan. On May 16. 1933. when Mr. Acheson was first being sponsored as a Government employee. Senator Tydings said: It has not been said but should be said that Mr. Acheson has represented the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In other words. he has also in times past represented the Soviets. Last year Mr. Acheson said he would do nothing to subvert or undermine the Soviet Government or its system. Why will he not do that? Because he has represented these governments as clients. It could very well be that our foreign policy should be such that we should take measures to help the enslaved peoples of those countries to undermine those governments. but it will never be done under Mr. Achesons policy. because they have been his clients. He recognizes them as legitimate governments. and they are not.",

At that time I argued against it as being a bill of attainder. However. the amendment did pass. and it passed in the other body and was eventually tested in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said it was unconstitutional and directed the Congress to pay the back salaries of these three men. While this may not be a bill of attainder. I think it is in essence the same as a bill of attainder. and. as the gentleman from California said. it applies to only three or four people in our Government. so in spirit it is a bill of attainder and. of course. I would oppose it. But I would oppose it also from another standpoint. I am one of those who believes that Dean Acheson has done a good job. I am not saying he has done a perfect job. but I want to stand up here and be counted at this time on his side. He was one of the architects of the United Nations. and the people of this country adopted that as a national policy. He spoke in the South for the Marshall plan before General Marshall spoke in Virginia for the plan which was eventually named the Marshall plan. Dean Acheson is the architect of the Marshall plan. it has done more in my opinion to stop communism throughout the world than any other one thing. So I am favorable to the plan and want to be counted as one of those who believes Dean Acheson has done a magnificent job. He is the greatest Secretary of State that we have had in many many years. At some future time I expect to speak at length on the leadership which Mr. Acheson has displayed during his tenure in the Department of State.

The reward and the punishment are always the same. The reward is widespread recognition. the punishment fierce denial and detraction. When a mans work becomes a standard for the whole world. it also becomes a target for the shafts of the envious few. If his work be merely mediocre. he will be severely left aloneif he achieve a masterpiece. it will set a million tongues awagging. The leader is assailed because he is a leader. and the effort to equal him Is merely added proof of that leadership. Failing to equal or excel. the follower seeks to depreciate or destroy. but only confirms once more the superiority of that which he strives to supplant. There is nothing new in this. It is as old as the world and as old as human passionsenvy. fear. greed. ambition. and the desire to surpass. And it all avails nothing. If the leader truly leads. he remains the leader.

It does seem to me we have enough redblooded Americans in this country to do the job of carrying on these functions of the State Department without using people whose loyalty is questioned. The straightforward way to get rid of Acheson would be by impeaching him. I would be the first one to vote for impeachment. I do not suppose that could be accomplished. because the machinery of impeachment is quite cumbersome. A New Deal committee and judge would stop all procedures. A man who has so universally lost the confidence of the American people ought to be replaced. I think from a political standpoint it is better for the Republicans to keep him in. he is good ammunition. but for the good of the country a man who has been in the position he now finds himself should no longer be Secretary of State.

Therefore. you are directing your fire at the wrong person. If you do not like Achesons policies. do you not know that if he were fired. either by your amendment or otherwise. his superior would not replace him with someone who would not agree with the President? That seems obvious to me. I do not see any particular point in firing a hired hand who will be replaced by the same boss simply because you disagree with the policy of the hired hand. Our foreign policy or the lack of one may be the technical work of the Secretary of State but. in the final analysis. the President must accept responsibility for it.

The purpose of this speech is to provide a brief but somewhat comprehensive background to the pending foreign assistance legislative proposal. To the extent that it does this. it may be of some value. since little consideration seems to have been given this year to the pervading policy problems to which such background is especially pertinent. Before I go into that. Mr. President. I want to say that one of the things which have disturbed me very much. as I pointed out on August 23. in the whole matter of foreign military and economic aid. is the failure of greater recognition on the floor of the Senate of the fact that it is impossible to separate economic and military aid from the total defense of the United States. I consider it a great mistake to be talking in terms of military aid as thought it were something separate and distinct from economic aid. if what we are talking about is the overall problem of defense. In fact. I am inclined to think that granting economic aid to our allies in Europe is much more important now than granting specific items in terms of equipment of war. In my view. the building up of the productive power of England. of France. and of Holland and the other Lowland Countries. and of Italy. and our other allies. is the way to build up Americas defense in Europe. rather than by supplying them with trucks and tanks and antiaircraft guns and machine guns and all the rest. important as they areand I am for supllying them. Senators know we have them. and I have a hunch or a feeling that it would not be very good policy to suggest a very drastic cut in the items of war to be sent to Europe. It might be interpreted as undermining General Eisenhower. But. Mr. President. there are those who have the knives or the axes ready to hack away at the very roots of the economic strength of Europe. the development of which. in the long run. I think. will represent the greatest security to America. when compared with the immediate supplying of manufactured equipment made in the United States and shipped to Europe.",

ECA. and the mutualsecurity program of the pending bill. I have noticed in this argument. not only on the floor of the Senate here tonight. but in committee and elsewhere. that the proponents of the Smith program slide and shift into a discussion which seeks to give the hearer the impression that the ECA program is in effect on all fours with the present program of mutual security. That is not so. I wish to point out some of the differences. A separate agency responsible to the President was created to conduct the European recovery program. Because of that fact it does not follow that identical principles can be applied to the entire mutual security program. The objectives of ERP and the methods to attain them were simple by comparison with the complex nature of the military economic. and technical assistance programs now under consideration. The opportunity for jurisdictional strife. I think. would be multiplied many times under the mutual security program over what the dangers were under ECAand they were plenty under ECA. and made it necessary even then. as I said earlier tonight. to work out a liaison relationship with the State Department Foreign Service. the State Department embassies in foreign fields. and the ECA officials.",

I cannot understand the argument of the opposition that the law should prohibit a seller from meeting the lawful prices of his competitors. but should permit him to meet the unlawful prices of his competitors. Let us stop and think that one out. Assume that one of my competitors offers a lawful lower price to my customers. If I cannot meet that price. my customers will purchase the goods from my competitor at that lower price. and no law will be violated. How can I compete if I am denied the right to meet the price which my competitor lawfully offers to my customer? However. if my competitors price is an illegal one. then the opponents of this measure urge that I. too. should be permitted to violate the law in order to meet that illegal price. Think of that. Mr. President. That is the argument of the opponents of this measure. They complain that we would not permit another person to meet an illegal price which was offered. The theory. as expressly stated in the minority views. is that two wrongs may make a right. I cannot subscribe to that philosophy.

The collection of vital statistics has served a good purpose in the past in giving us a measuring rod of the seriousness of the health situation and enabling us to measure progress from time to time. It has been a very valuable stimulus. and the Federal system has helped us to build up. with the States and the counties. a very good method of recording death and sickness figures. But today. in this time of need for economy. certainly it seems as though we could make some reduction in the collection of figures. My proposal. therefore. is that we cut this item by a further amount of $860.000.

A portion of the increase in money national income. to which the Senator from Massachusetts has referred. is not an increase in real income. It stems from inflation and a rise in prices. Therefore we must beware not to take it as an indication of a complete increase in prosperity. I should like further to invite attention to the mysterious saving of $80.000.000. which was supposed to result from curtailment of deliveries from 2 a day to 1 a day. The Post Office Department. with a fine flourish. said it had saved $80.000.000. That represents 5 percent of Post Office expenditures. If it had saved 5 percent. it follows. if a 3.7 percent Increase in postal business is expected. that the Department certainly would not need any additional funds. and that the increase in business could be taken out of the savings resulting from the reduction in deliveries. In fact. one could expect a dividend of 1.3 percent to be paid to the taxpayers. Such a dividend. if my hasty calculation is correct. would amount to $23.000.000. I am trying to save only $36.000.000. We must not pretend that the Post Office Department is a perfect human institution. I do not believe it is any reflection upon the officers of the Department to say that probably there is not 100 percent efficiency in the Post Office Department. It is an old institution.

Each time a machine is purchased the Post Office Department states that the use of the machine will make it cheaper to operate the Post Office Department. Yet we find that the appropriations for the Department have increased year after year. I think the distinguished Senator from Illinois has hit the nail squarely on the head when he has mentioned the new machine in this case. because it is typical and symbolic of the kind of machines which have been purchased during the past 10 years. as a result of huge appropriations. The officials of the Post Office Department always tell us that if we permit them to buy the machines. they will be able to operate the Post Office Department more cheaply than before.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I should like to make a statement at this time. if I may do so. If we examine the first page of the committees report on the TreasuryPost Office appropriations bill. we find a summary of what the committee is proposing. The estimates for 1952 were $2.958.425.000. almost $3.000.000.000. Under the appropriations recommended by the committee. the total savings amount to $20.730.353. or a proposed saving of less than 1 percentin fact. only approximately twothirds of 1 percentin the case of the postal service and the Treasury combined. For the postal service albne. the decrease from the 1952 estimates is only $16.750.000. or only approximately twothirds of 1 percent. and the estimates are approximately $92.000.000 more than the appropriations for the fiscal year 1951. or more than 4 percent greater than the appropriations for the last fiscal year. Mr. President. I wish to point out that we have a very serious general budgetary situation. At a minimum we must cut $5.000.000.000 from the estimates submitted by the Bureau of the Budget. We can make some savings on the military expenditures. by eliminating the waste theresaving of approximately $2.000.000.000. We can save some in connection with foreign aid. about which my friend. the Senator from Nebraska . always needles me when domestic issues come up. I think we can make some saving there. However. we also must save on the appropriations for defense. nondefense items. In fact. we must save. especially on nondefense items. Here is a bill of approximately $3.000.000.000. which the committee proposes savings of less than 1 percent. In my judgment we must save approximately $2.000.000.000 on domestic. nondefense items. or an average cut of approximately 20 percent. Now the committee comes forward with a proposal for a cut of twothirds of 1 percent. In view of the general financial situation of the country and in view of the specific facts connected with the postal service. I submit that my proposal for another cut of $36.000.000 is most modest. indeed. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

But these were conditions which prevailed last year and the year before. I believe that this Congress has taken steps to correct these conditions in this years allocation of quotas. However. I point out that peanuts are only one item affected by this proposal. The dairy industry is much more seriously affected. The bill which weare considering represents amendments to the Defense Production Act. I quote from the purposes of the D3fense Production Act: To facilitate the productior of goods and Services necessary for the national security. and for other purposes. According to the Senator from Washington. the purpose of this amendment is to guarantee the maintenance of production of certain oils and fats in the United States during the period of the emergency. Therefore I think the Senator from New Mexico was not on good ground in contendiig that the amendment was out of order. It is just as important to have oils and fats and dairy products as it is to have other commodities.",

He was determined to preserve. at all cost to himself. for this generation. and those who come after us. the American way of life.

We Kansans had knowledge of his untiring energy. his outstanding ability. and his great capacity for leadership. years before he came into national prominence as a Member and leader in the United States Senate. KENNETH WHERRY was a product of the great Middle West. He rose to high rank in national affairs in a steady. progressive fashion. because he was fair. aggressive. and loyal to the principles in which he believed. He threw himself with great vigor into the affairs of his own State and his own community. and he followed that pattern in his work in this great legislative body. Senator WHERRY was intensely patriotic. His faith in America and the American Constitution was unbounded. His motivation at all times was the preservation of this Republic and the Constitution upon which it was founded. Senator WHERRY worked untiringly until the last. He never spared himself. We know now that there were occasions when he appeared on the Senate floor while he was in great bodily pain. but he carried on with great courage and fortitude despite his sufferings. The American Republic was founded by men who had a deep faith in God. and who steadfastly maintained that. under God. this Nation of freemen could be preserved by succeeding generations. Senator WHERRY possessed such a faith. I shall always remember. as one of the new Members of the Senate. how helpful he was to those of us who came into this body. assisting us in his kindly and understanding manner. which endeared him not only to those of us of the younger school. but as well to those with longer service. His tragic and untimely passing has brought sorrow to every Member of the Senate. He will be greatly missed by each of us. because each of us knew his sincerity. his fidelity to conviction. his courage. his integrity. and his great depth of character.

He is a hard fighter. He fought for what he thought was right and best for his people. I know his people will all realize that he did everything he could to get these transmission lines there. even though the long line he asked for did not square with the present transmissionlinebuilding policy of Congress. I hope that in the future the folks in Minnesota will ask for only a part of the line. which I was willing to agree to for this year. The line I suggested as a compromise was from the Garrison Dam down to the city of Benson. This would have given them an outlet to a load center. The gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN] holds to the viewpoint of the 20 cooperatives and the 3 private utilities that a compromise offer as I have suggested will not do the job that is July $5 necessary. I cannot agree with this viewpoint and urge upon the various parties affected that they be willing next year to accept this compromise. which I personally have assured the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN] that I will support. Again let me pay a tribute to my colleague. the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN]. He has fought hard for these lines the past 2 years and the original request from the budget for this system of lines was commenced by him in April 1951. I have no doubt that he will eventually secure these lines. but today we are not in position to agree to his request. His fight for rural electrification over the years is well known to all of us. He has done much for agriculture in the past and his people will need his services here in the future.",

Subsequently. he served In the State senate. which included a term as president pro tempore. before his election to the Congress. The Congress loses a fine legislator with BILL STIGLERs retirement. The United States has been a better place to live because of his service here. and the people of his district have received the finest reputation that it is possible for a people to receive. BILL STIGLER is one of the most truly devoted public servants I have ever known. Scrupulous in the performance of his duties. able. conscientious. kindly. and generous of impulse. tenacious and unyielding in principles. manly and courageous by instinct. forwardlooking in approach. his service is one of outstanding ability and rare devotion to duty. By his example of tolerance. his patience and sympathy for feelings of others. by his gentle good humor and his courage. he has contributed to this Congress the best that God has made in man. His life has been rich because it has been spent in public service. The good wishes of every Member of this House. regardless of political affiliation. go with him as his service ends.

I can take you there and show you jails full of them. because the ranchers and the people themselves gather them up and tell the immigration officials they are there and to come and get them. Now. if you want to meet that problem. you cannot do it with this legislation or this type of legislation or any other compulsions which bring it here at this time. It has got to be a far more intelligent approach than so far has been made.",

That would be basically the suggestion I would make. One of the great problems has been that the people who have negotiated these contracts have done so under pressure from the Department 6f Labor. the American Federation of Labor. and the CIO. not with farm groups. not with farmers. but with elements who have nothing to do with it and do not understand the problem.

Of course. that was inevitable because the State of Texas Is a part of the Union. and the problem of aliens illegally entering the United States is there as well as elsewhere. But. actually what this measure is designed to do is to cure a deficiency in the fundamental statute. Let me call your attention to section 8 of the Immigration Act of 1917. It reads as follows: SEc. 8. That any person. including the master. agent. owner. or consignee of any vessel. who shall bring into or land in the United States. by vessel or otherwise. or shall attempt. by himself or through another. to bring into or land in the United States. by vessel or otherwise. or shall conceal or harbor. or attempt to conceal or harbor. or assist or abet another to conceal or harbor in any place. including any building. vessel. railway car. conveyance. or vehicle. any alien not duly admitted by an immigrant inspector or not lawfully entitled to enter or to reside within the United States under the terms of this act. shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $2.000 and by imprisonment for. a term not exceeding 5 years. for each and every alien so landed or brought in or attempted to be landed or brought In. And. I ask you especially to note this language: \"for each and every alien so landed or brought in or attempted to be landed or brought in.\" So. Mr. Chairman. the language of the act is deficient in that it does not spell out a punishment for harboring aliens who are illegally in the United States. It is in an attempt. and I am sure we have done so. to cure this situation that this measure is before the House today. I would like to call your attention to a part of a decision of the Supreme Court involving the said section 8 of the 1917 act. in which the Court argues \"if only imperfect grammar stood in the way. the construction might be accepted.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. President. perhaps it is an indication of undue faith for me to submit the amendment. because it is designed to strengthen the bill. rather than to weaken it. and thus far every action taken both in the committee and on the floor has been an action to weaken the bill. I have no desire to inflict pain upon myself. but I think the issue on this point should be made clear. Under the present law. in the event that there is a price overcharge. a suit may be brought either by the victim of the overcharge or. if he fails to bring a. suit within 30 days. by the President or his agent. The damages which may be collected by means of such a suit are limited to three times the amount of the overcharge. but in no event can they be more than the overcharge plus $10.000. The latter is the important point. for this provision means that any overcharge under $5.00U is subject to the trebledamage penalty. but that any overcharge over $5.000 is limited by the $10.000 provision. Let me give a few illustrations of that situation. If the overcharge amounts to $1.000. the penalty is $3.000. If the overcharge is $2.500. the penalty is $7.500. If the overcharge is $5.000. the penalty is $15.000. In the foregoing illustrations. there are treble damages. but beyond that point. the $10.000 limitation comes into effect and reduces the amount of the penalty. For instance. If the overcharge is $20.000. the penalty is not $60.000 but only $20.000 plus $10.000. or $30.000. If the overcharge is $200.000. the penalty is not $600.000 but only $200.000 plus $10.000. or $210.000. In other words. the greater the overcharge the cheaper the penalty. Thus there is almost an incentive to bigger and better overcharges. Mr. President. if any Senator can raise a reasonable objection as to why the punishment should not be made to fit the crime. I shall be glad to reconsider my amendment. I should like to ask. What possible objection could there be to such an amendment as this one? Of course. it may indicate too much trust on my part. for me to think that the Senate would adopt a strengthening amendment. after we have been ripping the vitals out of the bill. but Istill have hope.",

I therefore can see no legitimate reason for imposing our congressional will upon 1.400 communities which. after 9 months. have said by strong implication. \"We do not wish. within the next 90 days. to be under Federal rent controls.\" Then. tn important reason I can give the Senator is that this is a big undertaking. one with which the Senator from South CarQlina and his associates are going to grapple. There is an admission willingly given by the chairman and by every member of his committee. so far as I know. that the present law is nct workable. that it has defeated in a great many instances the fair and reasonable rights of American citizens. and that any measure the Committee on Banking and Currency of the Senate may recommend for the future will bear little or no similarity to the law under which we presently operate. one of the very prime reasons why we should not extend rent controls in the 1.400 communities is that we ought to restore to a free market. if only for a limited period. the question of rents. in order that. from an economic point of view. when members of the Committee on Banking and Currency sit down to think in terms of the writing of a new law for the future. they will know what they are working on and what they are talking about. For the most part. if we do not take these 1.400 communities from under controls in accordance with the right which was given them by law. the Banking and Currency Committee is not going to have the faintest idea. 3 months from now. as to what the economics of the situation is within those 1.400 communities. because they are going to be dealing with rents that were pegged and frozen for long periods during the past 10 years.",

Regardless of whether or not the Puerto Rican Constitution is approved in Congress. the Interior Department still stands guilty of noncompliance with a directive of the Congress. I repeat my statement of last week that the Department nurtures an atmosphere in which dictatorship in Puerto Rico can flourish. and at the same time use American dollars. Mr. President. it is time to get on with an investigation of the present regime in Puerto Rico. Several of us have said on the floor that charges of unAmerican conduct have been made against the Governor. Luis MufiozMarin.

I believe that it took the side of certain contractors in their fight with the Governor of Puerto Rico. These contractors claimed certain tax exemptions. which the Governor refused to grant. The claims for tax exemption were then taken to the courts of Puerto Rico. and I believe to the Federal court in this country. and were rejected. I think it would be interesting for the distinguished Senator from South Carolina to look into the cause. for the opposition of this newspaper to the Governor. The newspaper has been opposed to the Governor of Puerto Rico. Gov. Luis MufiozMarin. for a number of years. It has fought him tooth and nail. When the Senator from South Carolina suggests that we investigate the regime of the Governor of Puerto Rico. it seems to me that he is enunciating a very unusual doctrine. The Governor was elected by the people under authority given to Puerto Rico by the Congress of the United States. Certainly we are not going to investigate a governor who has been elected by the people. whether it be the people of a State or of a Territory. He was not appointed by the President of the United States or by the Congress. He was elected by the people of Puerto Rico in a free election. by a great majority. The vote was a thoroughly well invested expression of confidence in a man who has long been a fine public servant. With respect to the Constitution. which the Senator from South Carolina has discussed. and of which he is critical. I wish to point out that the proposal to hold an election. leading to a constitutional convention. was favorably reported by the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. of which I am a member. and was passed by the Congress. The people voted for it. The Constitution is now completed. and will be referred to the people for approval at an election on March 3.

From a level of 1.900.000 passenger cars produced in the third quarter of 1950. production has been progressively reduced through restrictions of material to not over 1.000.000 passenger cars for the first quarter of 1952. but with copper for only 930.000 cars.

We have all heard it said that steel could not be obtained for schools. hospitals. and so forth. but we are now discovering that some blast furnaces have to be closed down because there is more steel than can be used.

An effort is being made to hold up on steel. on the theory that. if it is needed. the dollars are available with which to buy it. and. by the way. there was available on January 1 $80.000.000.000. with which material for defense could be purchased. The Congress has appropriated so much money. more money than can possibly be used. But the material is being held up. and tickets are being issued on the theory that the money is available with which to buy it. therefore it can be obtained. But it is impossible to use it. and that accounts for the surplus of steel at the present time. As I have said. blast furnaces are being shut down. It is still necessary to consult the Defense Department. before steel can be obtained to meet the demands of schools and municipalities.

This was the sixth session of the Conference of Foreign Agriculture Organization but the first held in Rome since the Organization moved its headquarters there last April. It met from November 19 through December 6. 1951. I am sure the Senate knows that FAO was the first of the U. N. organizations to be founded after the last war. It was established in 1945 fnr the purpose of increasing the efficiendy of food and agriculture. improving natrition and raising the standard of living of people throughout the world. The Soviet Union never joined this organization and none of the Soviet bloc countries is a member. The Conference was held in the fine new building that the Italian Government completed as part of FAOs headquarters just before the Conference opened. Italys Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi turned the building over to FAOs DirectorGeneral Norris E. Dodd on the Conferences first day.",

Is that if the normal delays of international intercourse should be extended by blockaders. the outcome will not be an improvement in the relationship of the two peoples. The question would then arise in Canada as to whether a neighbor who is a partner in 48 miles of the St. Lawrence has a right to impede development of the whole. to Canadas economic detriment. At this writing Canada is still pinning its faith on the good neighbor policy to expedite action in Washington to release Canada to complete a communications system that is vital to her national growth. Mr. President. if there is doubt in the mind of anyone that Canada does not intend to proceed with this seaway alone. or if there is doubt in the mind of anyone that the Canadian people do not feel keenly the unfair treatment which they have received at the hands of the United States in this respect. and which they fear they may receive at the hands of this Congress. then a reading of this letter should dispel any such doubt. It is incredible. when we speak about developing good relations with nations at the far corners of the earth and with people in all parts of the world. that we should let a handful of selfish obstructionists mar the good relations between the United States and one of our best and nearest neighbors.

Under the existing law. such award cannot be made administratively. inasmuch as Colonel Turner has never held a federally recognized commission. his military status having arisen out of appointment to the staffs of the governors of various States. Colonel Turner has spent the greater part of his life in the development and improvement of aerial science in America. His name has become intimately Identified with the progress of aviation. both here and abroad. and his exploits and accomplishments have been many and varied. He has won the Thompson Trophy Race three times. on three occasions he placed third in the Thompson Trophy Race. he won second place in the speed division of the MacRobertson International Air Race. he has placed first. second. and third in various runnings of the Bendix Transcontinental Air Race. and is the only person who has placed in all three positions in that race. and he has broken the transcontinental airspeed record on seven separate occasions.

This bill has to do with approximately 160 acres of land belonging to an Episcopal Church mission known as the Shoshone Indian Church Mission. which was established by Dr. Roberts. an Episcopalian minister. in the late 1880s. Dr. Roberts constructed a ditch to these Indian mission lands. and also built a mission. Years later the Government decided to enlarge the irrigation facilities in this area. and made arrangements with Dr. Roberts whereby the Government would utilize his ditch. In return for utilizing his ditch. the Government agreed to deliver to Dr. Roberts water for his mission. That arrangement continued for a great many yearsI think for about 30 years. possibly more. At a later date the Bureau of Indian Affairs suggested to Dr. Roberts that perhaps he had received sufficient benefit for giving this ditch to the Government. and that payments would start. and payments did start. and the doctor continued to make them. There are no payments in arrears. Year before last this wonderful. fine gentleman passed on. at the age of 93. leaving a maiden daughter still living in the mission and teaching a small class of Indian girls. The Income from the land Is simply not sufficient to pay the current water costs. Understand. there are no back charges. they have been paid in full. In view of the fact that her father turned over the ditch to the Government. the daughter has requested that the charges be canceled for a period of 5 years. I think the maiden lady. now quite mature herself. having no income at all except the small amount she derives from teaching a few Indian children. should be entitled to receive water free for a period of 5 years.

It was not considered by the Veterans Committee in the House. although it deals with veterans insurance. It was considered by the Judiciary Committee. The Committee on Finance looked into the bill with some care. We thought. contrary to the recommendation of the Veterans Administrator. that there was a basis on which this insurance policy could be paid. It seems that the insured did not intend to permit his policy to lapse. but that he had a limited time. a fixed time under the policy. within which he might renew his policy. On the very day that he received notice that he could renew his policy. he had sent a check to pay the premium which was due. which indicated that he was doing something to keep his insurance alive. However. he died on the day the notice was received. Evidently the House felt that under the circumstances in the case the insurance policy could be paid. Of course. the bill does run counter to the policies of the Veterans Administration. It does establish a precedent. There is no doubt about it. The policy had actually lapsed. but within the period within which the veteran could renew his policy as a matter of right. he had forwarded a check. but did not ask for reinstatement of his policy. presumably because. as I have already stated. he died on that date. before he had received the notice from the Veterans Administration. The committee felt that. In the circumstances. it would be just to pay this insurance. The committee reported an amendment to the bill which undertakes to preserve the order of payments under the policy as it was originally taken out. that is. to preserve the priority of the beneficiaries. Under the bill as it passed the House. the entire amount of the insurance would have been payable to the claimant in this case. The committee was of the opinion that that should not be done. but that if the bill were to be enacted it should preserve the priority of the beneficiaries named in the original policy. I am very frank to say. on behalf of the committee. that while the committee decided to report the bill favorably. it did so with some misgivings. because it does constitute a precedent.",

The purpose of the bill was to correct the loophole in the present tax law whereby the Treasury Department was ruling that loans to political committees were legitimate deductions for incometax purposes. Since the introduction of that bill I have found that while it did correct this particular loophole. at the same time it opened another one whereby loans made to special committees set up for the election of State officers could be deductible. This certainly was not my intention when introducing the aforementioned bill. and just why the new loophole was incorporated I am at a loss to understand. My instructions to the legislative counsel were very specific. namely. that I did not want any loopholes left whereby any political contributions or loans of any description could be classified as incometax deductions. On behalf of the same Senators I have just mentioned. and myself. I now introduce for appropriate reference a corrected bill. A similar correction is being made in the companion bill which was introduced in the House on the same date. and as an additional safeguard a copy of this bill is being submitted to the Treasury Department and they are being asked for an advance opinion as to whether or not this bill will correct any and all possible loopholes in this field.

The desirability or undesirability of restricting imports of butter. cheese. and so forth. is a secondary issue. The paramount issue involved in the move to repeal section 104 is the startling proposition that Congress has no right to regulate imports contrary to the obligations assumed by the President in the General Agreement on Tariffs and and Trade. ordinarily referred to as GATT. The demand for repeal of section 104 is the culmination of a series of steps calculated to give GATT the status of a treaty.",

Denmark made the following protest of section 104 when it was adopted by the Congress: Since no quantitative restrictions of cheese imports into the United States were in force when the United States signed the GATT agreement in the autumn. 1947. the United States Government. In the view of the Danish Government. must be bound by section XI of the GATT agreement not to institute such restrictions. (Record of hearings. p. 2953.) Congress has not yet ceased to be part of the United States Government. The GATT agreement is an international obligation which is binding only upon the executive branch of this Government. 4. Iro AND GATT The reaction which section 104 has produced abroad is a perfect example of the confusion and ill will which is generated when the President assumes to deal with foreign nations without his constitutional partner. the Congress of the United States.

When the Italian Peace Treaty was brought before the Senate for ratification. the Senator from Utah argued that the treaty would render Italy militarily helpless in the face of Communist aggression and would deny her the means of selfpreservation. He pointed out that the reparations provisions of the treaty would saddle Italy with economic servitude and would impede her recovery. He charged that the territorial and other provisions of the treaty were departures from the announced principles of the Atlantic Charter. That was some 4 years ago. The Senator from Utah has never let up in his fight for revision of the Italian Peace Treaty. His most recent activity is Illustrated by a clipping I have before me from the May 31. 1951. issue of the New York Times.

He was admitted to the bar of the State of California in 1917 and commenced promptly law practice in Long Beach. Calif.. and established a large law practice.

After he returned to Long Beach from one term in Congressthe Seventythird session. March 4. 1933. to January 3. 1935he engaged in the oil business as an independent producer. He was not a candidate for reelection to Congress. He was a life member of the Elks and a member of the American Legion. I personally knew him from the year 1909. He was recognized as a very able. kindly. generous friend of a large circle of loyal friends. I know his wife and children personally. they are fine folks. She is a lovely ard loyal wife. His children are all adilts. I am sure that the House joins with me in expressing understanding sympathy to his family and his loved ones. His membership in this Congress was on the Democratic side of the political aisle. I shall always recall with pleasure my teaming up with him on a speaking team for the support of the Liberty bonds during the First World War.

I further charged that by maintaining these unfair prices that the stores had been overcharging and gouging the public for years. This mornings New York Times carries an article. Answer to OToOLE Issued by Gimbel. Mr. Gimbel in his statement says that the price war does not prove that the retail prices have been too high. Without specifying any particular articles he said that many items are now being sold in this war below cost. If this is so. Mr. Gimbel. is it not a fact that you and those whom you accuse of being guilty of this practice are engaged in unfair competition? You confess to and indict other members of your industry in engaging in practices that can do nothing but lead to the ruin of many of the small retailers in our Nation. With the great cash resources that the big stores have. with the secret rebates and kickbacks that the big store receives from the manufacturer and middleman. with the immense amount of money that the larger groups have for advertising. it is impossible for the smaller man to compete with you and stay in business. Mr. Gimbels answer is a further indication that there is an absolute need for the investigation that I have asked for of the entire price setup for meats. foods. clothing. and all household necessities. If. as Mr. Gimbel suggests. the large stores are now selling some items under cost. I believe that the Attorney General of the United States and of the various States should take cognizance of the fact and take action to prevent these unethical and unfair trade practices. From information that I have at my command. I definitely know that the great majority of the articles that have been reduced in this price war are still being sold by the large stores at a profit. At no point in his statement did Mr. Gimbel deny this fact. This is an implied admission that the 30 to 60 percent profits that were made on specified articles in the past were unfair profits.",

His efforts to secure attention from the Defense Department and from the State Department have certainly been continually ignored. Why? Because. I think.

The State Department has never been interested in charges made by antiCommunists. for fear that such unseemly interest might make the Russians \"mad.\" and the only way in which this matter can be developed is through the proper committee of the House of Representatives.

I desire to take a few moments of the Senates time today to discuss the socalled Hoover Commission recommendations and reports. and the action taken on them to date by the American Congress and by the Executive. The burden of Federal expenditures which will be placed upon our citizens for the next fiscal year. 1953. will roughly amount to $500 for every man. woman. and child in the Nation. Putting it another way. this amounts to about $2.000 per family. Except for a brief period at the height of World War II. this burden represents the heaviest financial obligation ever placed upon the citizens of this Republic. Mr. President. In view of these unpleasant facts. it seems to me that we bear two heavy responsibilities: first. to effect economies wherever possible. and second. to insure maximum efficiency in Government. that is. to get a dollars worth of service for every dollar spent. This obligation applies to all of us. regardless of political party. Therefore. I feel that it is incumbent upon us to give thorough consideration to the recommendations of the bipartisan Hoover Commission. both to the full implementation of the reforms so far enacted and to action on the reforms not enacted. I am sure all Members of this body will agree with me on the urgency of that matter. With this in mind. I recently addressed a letter to former President Hoover. asking him for his views on the progress made and on the economies to be expected from that bipartisan Commissions work. In effect. I said: \"Where do we go from here?\" Our former Chief Executive replied to me. under date of February 4. 1952. I ask that the letter be printed in the RECORD at this point as part of my remarks.",

These figures prove the pudding. The letter of Mr. Hoover demonstrates with lucidity that further vast savings can be accomplished by the reforms already enacted. His letter shows why we must press the administrative officials of Government for speedier implementation. greater results. and further economies. His letter shows why we must move ahead on the remainder of the recommendations of the bipartisan Hoover Commission. At this point I wish to make it perfectly clear that I have no desire to take away from the administration credit for accomplishments. What I want is more economyplenty of it.",

It gives the military sufficient manpower but still permits most men to remain at home with their families. Second. It saves the country about $20.000.000.000 a year. Third. It does not interfere with the education of our youth. I know there are many Members who are disturbed about the need for universal military training.

Point 4 takes its name from the last point of a fourfold program for peace in the worldthe program I set forth in my inaugural address. 3 years ago last January. We have been working on that program. and we have been making progress. We have done well on the first three points. First. we have supported the United Nations. Second. we have carried forward our plans for world economic recovery. Third. we have strengthened free nations against aggression. But these three points by themselves will not bring us the permanent peace we desire.

I am sorry to see the elimination of the funds requested for the promotion of rifle practice in the amount of $130.000. The National Board for Promotion of Rifle Practice was established by Congress in 1903 on the recommendation of President Theodore Roosevelt. From that time on it has been a traditional and continuous policy of Congress to encourage rifle marksmanship training for American boys and for all ablebodied male citizens capable of bearing arms in time of war or national emergency. The appropriation item of $130.000 does not supply any ammunition. arms. or equipment free of charge. This money merely provides the funds required to account for the several millions of dollars worth of arms. target frames. and range equipment now on loan to civilian rifle clubs and secondary schools and for the handling of the sale of spare parts. target materials. and similar items to such clubs and patriotic individuals who believe that rifle marksmanship is a necessary adjunct of national defense. In my opinion. the small item of $130.000 should be left in the budget. at least until further study is given to the effects which the committees cut will have on the entire civilian marksmanship program.",

A good many business people who attempted to comply with these voluntary standards found it Impossible. and so on January 26 we took the only action left open to us. and that was a general ceiling price regulation. The only difference I have with Mr. DiSalle is that he ought to have done that on December 19. not to have waited until January 26. until all prices went up.",

I cannot quote him exactly. but the Senator from Indiana has the hearings in his hand and can check on what Mr. DiSalle said. As I recall. Mr. DiSalle intimated that he did not have any idea of rolling back the prices of anything except beef. I may be wrong. but that is as I remember the testimony. But as soon as we had placed in the bill the section providing that he could not roll back anything else. he came up with the statement. as I read it in the newspapers. that he had intended to roll back many other things. How a businessman can operate not knowing whether the prices of his products are to be rolled back or not I do not understand. The issue is political. We ought to be frank about that. It is. \"What is the price of a beef steak?\" All other things are forgotten. The cry is. \"What Is the price of a beef steak?\" But the point is that if we are going to let the Director roll back the price of beef. we ought to let him roll back the price of everything else.",

From his 1950 appropriation the President had remaining. after all expenditures. $115.426. In 1951 he had $150.000 remaining. though he spent $45.020 of the 1950 amount which was carried over. In 1952 he estimates that he will have remaining $170.615. but that he will carry over from prior years $100.000. I hope the President will not find it necessary to add so many new employees to his staff and that he will not require all the money the bill provides.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to say first that I. too. have examined the record and I agree with what the Senator from Arizona has said regarding precedents. To my knowledge. this is without precedent. Perhaps that accounts for todays excessive expenditures. I might add that there is no precedent within the past 18 years of the Administration having made any sincere effort to cut the appropriations of any of the departments. But that is all the more reason my amendment should be adopted. It is high time that the .Congress established a precedent by calling not only upon the heads of the executive departments but also upon the President to cut out their extravagance and to begin rendering some account to the American people of the moneys spent. Perhaps the expanse accounts of the Presidents who preceded the present incumbent of the White House were not questioned. but I point out that. for the years 1944. 1945. and 1946. which were the war years. at no time. even at the peak of the war. did President Roosevelt spend more than $350.000 in this same classification. Last year the cost was almost five times that much. and we are being asked now for another $300.000 increase. If we are to continue this trend through the years and not call a halt sometime. where is it going to stop? I certainly shall insist on this amendment. I think it is time we established a precedent. So far as the argument is concerned that there has been no check placed upon the Senate and the House of Representatives. I may say that we should put a check on ourselves. The time has come when we must check them all. The President of the United States has himself said that those who would exempt their own budgets and be excused from cuts are selfish. Surely no Senator on this floor wants to put the President of the United States into the classification of the selfish individuals whom he so bitterly denounced.

It deals with the latest proposal made by the Chinese Communist regime. I wish to point out that on the face of it under the proposed ceasefire agreement. which would set up a 7nation conference. four of the nations mentioned have already expressed themselves as favoring the seating of the Chinese Communist regime in the United Nations. and have already expressed their willingness to barter Formosa to the Chinese Communists. Therefore I believe that in that respect the latest proposal has not changed the situation in any regard. In the past I have been critical of the State Department when I felt criticism of it was justified. At this time I wish to commend the recent statement of Mr. Gross. which very clearly indicated that the United States would not barter Formosa. and that no discussions would be had in relation to Formosa without the participation of the Government of the Republic of China in such discussions. Mr. President. based on press dispatches which have been received today it seems to me that the latest maneuver on the part of the Government of India in calling for another 48hour delay is purely an obstructive tactic. In the final analysis. what the UN must do. if it is not to lose the confidence of the people of the world. is clearly and frankly to brand Communist China as the aggressor that she is. If the United Nations fails to do so. it will lose the right to the moral support of the people of the world. Failure to designate Communist China as an aggressor will in fact be saying that a small aggressor is an aggressor. but a large aggressor is not an aggressor. and that. frankly stated. the doctrine of might makes right. I do not believe that the United Nations can continue to enjoy the confidence of the people of the world if it fails to face up to that issue.",

One thing everybody Is certain ofmillions of our young men will eventually find themselves in uniform.

If a man is old enough to undergo the hardships and dangers of military life. he is capable of voting. In fact. he is all the more qualified to vote for the very reason of the sacrifice he is making. Our countrys future will be made safe if Congress grants the sacred privilege of voting to our young men in all the services no matter what age they happen to be. Given the franchise of the ballot. our American fighting men will have a higher degree of patriotism and a realization that they are the policymakers of our country as well as the ones who carry out the policy. While I am discussing the ballot. I wish to point out how unsatisfactory was the soldier voting in World War II. It was unsatisfactory because it was incomplete. Not enough servicemen voted. Our duty. then. is not only to extend the vote to all military personnel regardless of age. but also to make it possible. through setting up proper methods of implementing a nearly total voting strength in all branches of the service. This can be done if we profit by the mistakes made during the last war. the lack of coordination. and the failure on the part of many to take this allimportant matter seriously.

There is no reason compelling us to give American citizenship to boys of foreign nationality who want to serve in our Army and eat army chow and wear army uniforms and who might carry part of the load of mutual defense in distant areas of the world. There is no reason why we should not enlist Germans to help carry the load in Europe and Japanese to help carry the load in Asia.
