I may add that if this continuing resolution remains in this form. I personally see no reason why Secretary Kissinger should continue the negotiations since Congress. in making its own foreign policy. will have deprived the Secretary of the only tools with which he can negotiate. and unless the whole Congress wishes to move to New York to .negotiate with. Greece. Turkey. and Cyprus. I fail to see how we are going to be able effectively to serve as mediators. If the Eagleton Amendment or simila language is adopted by the Congress. the United States will have lost its negotiating flexibility and influence. It thus hurts the very countries and objectives it purports to help. It is my intention. therefore. to withhold my consent to any continuing :resolution which reaches my desk containing language such as that found in the Eagleton Amendment. I can. however. accept. and Indeed endorse. the language relating to military assistance to Turkey contained in the continuing resolution as reported to the full -Senate by the Senate Appropriations Com-. mittee.

What we are saying is that whenever* .a nation takes money from the United States for one purposethat is. to defend itselfand uses that money as an aggressor nation against another nation. we are going to stop giving them money. That is a rather simple proposition. There are some deep underlying considerations. As I listened to .the deputy foreign minister today. Mr. Mavros. as he spoke to the National Press Club. the question was asked specifically of him. since he had met with Mr. Kissinger last night. if there are negotiations going on at the present time. He stated definitely. without any equivocation. that no negotiations are going on. Therefore. to say very simply in this body that by taking away what is right and proper and legal in the Eagleton amendment. this somehow will interfere with negotiations. appears to be somewhat of a misleading statement. Either Mr. Mavros knows what is going onhe is the deputy foreign ministeror otherwise there are negotiations which are going on with the Turkish people as a onesided proposition. It is a twosided proposition. The Senator from Texas spoke about the aggression started by Greece. \"Let me poifit out that if the same policy were followed by those who oppose the Eagleton amendment today. if that same policy had been followed in relation to the Greek junta by those of us who did speak up against the Greek junta. those of us who said we did not approve of giving military assistance to a nation and its using it for purposes other than to defend its own territory. then we would not -have a democracy in Greece today.

I vote against taking that action and would like to explain why I am Opposed to an immediate cutoff of funds. This question is relevant today in light of yesterdays action -and the. prospect that S. 3394 will be called up in the near future. The approach I favor is to urge Turkey to withdraw her troops from Cyprus and to give her a reasonable amount of time to do so. If she refuses to comply I could then readily support efforts to cut off any support we are giving her. The amendment which passed the Senate yesterday provides for an immediate cutoff of funds without giving Turkey an opportunity to plan for and carry out a troop withdrawal. The immediate cutoff of funds completely ignores our -NATO commitments to Turkey and completely ignores her particular strategic importance. Instead of walking softly and carrying a big stick the Senate seems to be prepared to club her without regard to other considerations. An amendment to S. 3394 may be offered by the junior Senator* from Massachusetts which. I believe is -a very reasonable approach. It would allow Turkey the opportunity to voluntarily withdraw her troops from Cyprus before we take any definite action such as withdrawing all military aid. If Turkey does not do so. and if the President is unable to certify that Turkey is making a \"good faith effort\" to reach an acceptable settlement on Cyprus. the aid would be halted. I will support that amendment. Mr. President. the issue of Turkey. Greece. and Cyprus is an extremely complex one and emotions run high. I am strongly in favor of withdrawing all foreign troops from Cyprus and have cosponsored Senate Concurrent Resolution 110 which has been offered by my other colleague from Massachusetts",

That Provision allows State educational agencies to carry over unexpended education funds into the fiscal year succeeding that in which such funds were appropriated. This authority will. under existing law. expire at the end of fiscal year 1974. Originally enacted in 1968. tnis provision has proved of invaluable help to State education officials in allowing unem to spend their Federal funds wisely. without the usual requirement that appropriationsoften not made until late in the fiscal yearbe spent quickly or revert to the Treasury. This year the need for carryover authority is even more crucial. as the administration has only recently released $466 million In illegally impounded education funds. To insist that these funds be spent before June 30 is to encourage their waste. The Subcommittee on Education. which I chair. is aware of these substantial concerns and Is attempting to be responsive to them. S. 1539. the Education Amendments of 1974. was ordered reported from the subcommittee to the full Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on December 19. It is my hope that it will receive speedy full committee consideration and floor action within the next month and a half. The bill. as currently drafted. not only extends the applicability of the current provision for 5 years. but also allows an extra year of carryover authority for any funds which were made available to the recipient as a result of a judicial proceeding. This would allow carryover of both the impounded fiscal year 1973 funds just released by the administration and the just enacted fiscal year 1974 appropriations for education through fiscal year 1975. This would ease the difficulties which State and local school officials now face as decisions must be made for the coming school year. I would like to assure my colleagues that I will do everything in my power to expedite consideration of this important legislation as a part of the larger extension of basic Federal authorities in the field of elementary and secondary education.",

Until now. the Social Security Administration has considered such prostheses as cosmetic devices and has not. therefore. provided payment for their cost.

I can think of no other single item so essential to the future health of the American economy. as well as to Congress effort to reestablish itself as a vital and responsive institution of Government. than the budget reform legislation which is presently in conference. The American people are not fully aware of how Congress lack of budget control prevents a sound economy. Many of them do not realize that year after year. Congress appropriates legislation with no regard for spending priorities. At the end of the year. Congress adds up the totals. If we have a balanced budgetwhich is rareit is purely an accident. Is it any wonder why Congress has received a positive rating of only 21 percent of the American people? If the people were aware that Congress for years has had absolutely no formal mechanism through which it could make the rational fiscal decisions which need to be made. they would have surely voted its Members out. and well they should. For Congress has flatly ignored its constitutional responsibility to manage the taxpayers money. The 93d Congress. Mr. Speaker. deserves much credit for recognizing the danger of this blindmans approach to fiscal matters and for doing something to correct it. The special joint committee developed a comprehensive plan for reform that will force Congress to make the necessary fiscal decisions which it has long ignored. Both Houses of Congress deserve the highest praise for passing this legislation. Now. only one final hurdle is left before this historic reform can be put to work for the people of America. Further delay is inexcusable. Denial of final passage is unthinkable. We have gone a long way toward filling the tremendous void of fiscal irresponsibility in the Congress. Now that the battle is nearly won. we cannot lose the commitment which prompted this monumental study in the first place. We cannot afford to rest until the budget reform bill is successfully out of conference and is sent to the President for his signature. Mr. Speaker. the American people are tired of inflated prices at the marketplace. They deserve better from their elected representatives in Congress.

At that time. these reforms were simply a desire felt by many Members of varying seniority. Today both Houses of the Congress have acted on a measure to accomplish these reforms and a conference coimittee has been formed to resolve the differences between the versions. How far we have come. Mr. Speaker. in a single year. But to have come this far is not in itself sufficient cause for rejoicing. If the conference committee does not complete its work and report out a strong bill that can achieve final acceptance by both Houses. we may lose the progress already made. These reforms must become law. In the year that has gone by since the special order last March 7 this Congress has authorized expenditures of hundreds of billions of dollars. It has done so without the benefit of the perspective full budgetary consideration could provide. In that year the Federal debt has increased by billions of dollars. I. for one. believe that this is an unfortunate fact. But what is even more unfortunate is that the Congress has taken action under which this debt has mounted without the benefit of budgetary analysis which would allow each of us to fully evaluate the ramifications of our actions. The time has come to bring this bill forward and make it law. I doubt that it would be an exaggeration to say that this can be one of the most important measures passed by this Congress.",

In the past 10 years our national debt has increased $162 billion. In fiscal year 1973. the Government paid $24.2 billion in interest on the Federal debt and even more in fiscal year 1974. This amounts to some $50 billion which the taxpayers must pay without receiving a pennys worth of service in return. With the power of the purse. Congress must also take on the responsibility to recommend expenditures over the vast spectrum of needs but always keeping in mind the total picture. There are desperate national needs for additional funds for the environment. energy. our cities. housing. medical care. and any number of crucial domestic needs. Congress has the power and responsibility to set priorities in these areas. This responsibility has been shirked. At the same time the agencies in the executive branch have expanded and have filled the vacuum of power vacated by Congress with respect to the budget. We have simply not kept pace and do not now have the tools necessary to accomplish our task in this area.

And I would be correct: inmates of nursing homes are not organizing themselves into political units. they are being organized. It is an important distinction. because it represents the gap between voluntariness and being used. Our old people are being used by Legal Services attorneys for political purposes. That is a strong charge. but I do not say it carelessly. The AugustSeptember 1972 issue of Clearinghouse Review. an OEO Legal Servicesfunded publication from Northwestern University School of Law. published a lengthy article on the organizing of nursing home occupants. explaining \"why and how nursing home patients should be organized into selfgoverning groups.\" It explained how to approach the patients. \"an organizer simply assumes the role of a friendly visitor.\" Problems may arise like administrators or proprietors will oppose organization. The article went on to tell organizers how to defend themselves against administrators seeking to save their clients from this latest invasion of their peace and quiet. Somehow.

I believe there is a much better way to go about it than by supporting the conference report. My preference. over all. Is for an alternative to the staff attorney system which would be perpetuated by the Legal Services Corporation bill as drafted. Such an alternative is known as judicare. It would permit attorneys full freedom of action. while allowing clients freedom of choice of attorneys. With some effective guidelines regarding political activities. and outside activities. a system like this could conceivably satisfy most major criticism of Legal Services. It would do that by eliminating the poverty law offices. the Legal Services offices. whose only purpose is to seek out business to keep themselves justified in the eyes of their funding source. With a system of judicare. those unable to afford legal attention would receive it. and would be able to choose their attorneys from among the regular. practicing lawyers in the community. There are other alternatives besides judicare. but since judicare has been around the longest. it has been tested already and seems the best bet at this point. John Satterfield. a former chairman of the American Bar Association. circulated a letter earlier this year expressing his preference for the judicare system.

I am pleased to express my support for the amendment offered by my friend. the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin . which would add to the bill authority for special pay and bonuses to podiatrists and optometrists. As the House will remember. both of these professions were included in similar legislation passed by this body in 1972. The Defense Department considered them. along with dentistry. optometry and veterinary medicine. \"critical health professions.\" That legislation died in the Senate. The incremental cost of adding these two professions to the bill should be minimal. I understand. for example. that there are only about 75 podiatrists currently on active military duty. But the principle involved here is an important one. Mr. Chairman. If the Congress expects to make the voluntary Army work. it must be willing to provide the incentive tools needed to attract the skills the military requires. I believe it is important to emphasize that. as far as annual bonuses authorized by the amendment are concerned. they are completely discretionary on the part of DOD. Not until a shortage in a particular profession actually appears will a bonus be offered to attract and retain people in that profession. No one contends. Mr. Chairman. that an emergency shortage of podiatrists or psychologists exists today. But neither do the Armed Forces face an emergency shortage of any of the health professionals other than medical doctors. There is fully as much justification for including these two critical health specialties in this legislation. One final point. Mr. Chairman: It is expected that. by 1978. just 4 years from now. we can expect a reasonable supply of health professionals from the Uniformed Services Health Academy. Until then. Congress should provide the authority for DOD to maintain the necessary level of health professionals in all of those areas deemed critical by the services.

Corporations manufacturing computers. electronics and photographic equipment should exercise restraint in encouraging excessive data surveillance. I am pleased to call attention to the fact that Polaroid Corp. produces identification cards as do other firms. However. they have refused to supply equipment where they believe control rather than simply administrative requirements are intended. We need more of this corporate responsibility.",

The law offers the individual protection against physical surveillance. but virtually none against data surveillance.

This private information often includes highly personal. unverified hearsay and gossip. Illegal or even legal access to this data and the exchange and selling of such information without the knowledge of the individual involved endangers the basic right to privacy. A person who voluntarily fills out a form. takes a psychological test. or has a physical examination may not consider or anticipate that confidential information resulting from these acts may well wind up in a computer and follow him for the rest of his life. affecting the course of his life. One of the more startling examples of Government invasion of privacy was the Executive ordernow fortunately rescindedwhich gave the Department of Agriculture the power to Inspect Federal tax returns of farmers \"needed for statistical purposes.\" We are all affected by the indiscriminate use of data collectedthrough credit records that often contain misinformation or computer mistakes: through health record data banks used by life. health and accident Insurance companies. through bank records. military records. school records. and juvenile records. There is even a Government controlled data bank of information on children of migrant farmworkers. Intelligence gathering operations are carried out by some 20 Federal agencies and by State. county. and city agencies. There are many more examples of data collecting mechanisms such as airline computers. television surveys. psychiatric reports. and polygraph tests. Recordkeeping may appear harmless on the surface.

We see this in the accumulation of personal data in computer banks and other such means which constitutes a threat to the privacy of every American citizen. There are some who look upon individual tax returns as the greatest source of such information. The assurance provided the American people that information voluntarily given on Federal tax returns will be carefully protected from disclosure and improper use is one the basic concepts underlying this countrys system of collecting taxes and I want to assure that protection. I am cosponsoring legislation which will further restrict accessibility to taxpayers tax returns. Even though the matter which precipitated this bill. namely. the move to check tax returns of farmers ostensibly for the purpose of obtaining information on which to base farm programs. has been resolved. it is my hope that the Ways and Means Committee will grant early and favorable action so the authority for inspection of individual tax returns by Federal agencies will be severely restricted.",

As I stated earlier. the senior Senator from North Carolina and I agree that legislation is needed to insure adequate information being supplied by the Executive branch to Congress.

Frankly. I am concerned that the cure is worse than the illness. While I believe we have a right to secure adequate information. it is important that we not put ourselves in such a position that we will make innocent people suffer if for any reason information is not supplied to Congress. What the conference report provides is that if the USIA did not supply the information within 35 days. its funds would be automatically cut off.

The appropriation line item has been restored to the bill. Certainly. if there are Federal expenditures. then there is a Federal responsibility to see to it that these funds are wisely spent. The reprograming has been deleted from the bill so that the Mayor and Council could not just reprogram the funds that the Congress has appropriated. Neither could the Mayor reprogram up to $25.000 without even Council approval. They have deleted the councils jurisdiction over the elected school board and put in a provision so that the President has 10 days in which to sustain the Mayors veto if the Council overrides the Mayors veto. Mr. Chairman. if I may. let me go on to some of the parts of the bill that I think this House must very seriously consider. In the committee bill there is a provision for bonding up to 14 percent. In the original committee bill there was a provision for a referendum so that the people of the District of Columbia could vote on that 14 percent bond issue. The committee print published yesterday has deleted this provision which would give the right to the people of the District of Columbia to approve or disapprove of that bonding provision. It seems to me when the committee print keeps in the neighborhood councils which is something that we have had so much trouble with in the war on poverty program. and with the maximum feasible participation provision but deletes the provision which provides really meaningful participation by the people on the 14percent bonding issue. then I think a disservice has been done. I hope that provision for a referendum should be restored. May I go on to two other things. and the gentleman from Minnesota will discuss the other matters later.",

It provides for a $500 million reduction in the overall authorization. whereas the amendment by Mr. HUMPHREY would provide for a $750 million reduction. Since the bill came to the Senate. we have added something like $499.700.000 to the bill. My amendment would reduce the overall amount by almost the same amount that the Senate has increased the authorization since the bill first was called up and subjected to debate and amendment. so that the $1.5 billion reduction which the Armed Services Committee made in the bill then would be restored. My reduction would not go to any line item. it would merely be an overall reduction of $500 million. I think my amendment a fair compromise of conflicting viewpoints. Senator HUMPHREY is asking for a reduction of $750 million. There are those on one side. philosophically. who would like to see a larger reduction in the authorization. There are others who want to see no reduction at all in the authorization. So. as we come to the close of action on the bill the time has come for the Senate to conclude. on Monday. whether there is to be an overall reduction. Some Senators would like to see a deeper reduction. as I say. and others no reduction at all. My amendment would simply reduce the overall reduction by an amount almost equal to the amounts added to the bill during the course of the debate here on the floor. Thus the comthe same overall authorization. dollarwise. as was reported to the floorwhich mittee would go to conference with about represented a $1.5 billion reduction at that time.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the United States is not the only country in the world that recognizes the value of a forestry incentives program to encourage timber production. The July 1973 issue of the South African Panorama contains an interesting article detailing the efforts of the Republic of South Africa to encourage timber production. This article is especially relevant in its emphasis on the financial return that a country can expect from an investment in timber growth. As our colleagues know. the administration has proposed a reduction in U.S. Forest Service personnel of almost 1.600 individuals. This country is presently experiencing a timber shortage. and such a move could seriously worsen an already critical environmental situation as well as signal a reduction in funds provided the States from their share of the money gained from timber harvest on national forest lands. In fact. for every dollar spent in our timber programs. $4 is returned to the U.S. Treasury. Twentyfive percent of this amount goes to the States in which national forests are located. The administration proposal to slash Forest Service personnel simply does not make sense. This is one of few Federal programs that actually make money for the taxpayer. It should and must be protected. Mr. Speaker. the experience of South Africa is but one example of a country taking the necessary steps to protect its environment and insure adequate timber supply for future generations. It is an experience that the United States would do well to heed. I Include the previously cited article from the South African Panorama in the RECORD at this point: [From the South African Panorama.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I was most gratified to learn of a much needed effort to build a bridge between the policeman and citizens of the District of Columbia. which I proudly represent. A publication in the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic. written by Dr. Kenn Rogers of the Cleveland State University. describes and evaluates this attempt to promote a better understanding between the working police officers and the citizens living in our city. The program involved four intensive seminars conducted by the Pilot District project. whose task was to educate middlemanagement police officials and other participants about group processes and authority lines. This provided participants with a frame of reference in which they could experience the effects of authority upon themselves and others. In the process. they examined their own role behavior. perceptions and attitudes as they manifested themselves within the different groups. The seminars Instituted anxiety and conflict situations resulting in the open awareness of problems such as race. class. age. responsibility. and authority. The Pilot District projects attempt to create improved policecommunity relations can be illustrated in Dr. Rogers words from the paper where he states that the P.D.P.s original mission was seen as an effort to break the vicious circle where on the one hand the police were perceived as an occupation army in enemy territory. displaying attitudes of hostility and brutality toward the residents. On the other hand. in the perceptions of the police. they were trying to exert honest and concerned efforts at enforcing the law. This attempt at improving policecommunity relations is a step in the right direction and should be emulated in an effort to decrease the existing hostilities in our Nations cities. The article by Dr. Rogers which details the dynamics which took place and points to alternative models for training of police was published in September 1972 by the Menninger Foundation. I recommend its helpful reading to all of my colleagues. CXIX2021Part 25",

Fish and other marine life are a major source of the worlds protein supply. and the continuing availability of the supply is being very gravely threatened. Hundreds of foreign fishing vessels are fishing in our coastal waters. just beyond our 3mile territorial sea and 9mile contiguous fishing zone. These foreign boats. virtually unregulated and too numerous to monitor. are systematically depleting these once fertile fishing grounds. Off New England. species such as haddock and herring have already been eliminated as sources of large amounts of harvestable protein. Other species of fish not yet depleted by the overwhelming foreign fishing effort are being brutally sucked from the sea by efficient. governmentsubsidized foreign fleets in quantities that guarantee their speedy elimination as exploitable sources of protein as well. The problem of uncontrolled foreign fishing off our coasts is not one that confronts just New Englandnor does it affect just our fishermen. It confronts all our coastal areas. our whole Nation. and the world. A source of protein for the people of the United States and the people of the world is being irreparably damaged. The foreign nations fishing off our coasts must be restrained before they have completely destroyed this resource. Mr. Speaker. we are being robbed of one of our most precious natural sources of proteinthe fish in our coastal waters. I urge my colleagues in the Congress to act immediately and firmly to stop this depletion of our marine resources. to prevent this loss of an extremely valuable and necessary source of foodin short. to stop the great protein robbery that is occurring right now off our shores.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am introducing a bill today to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to authorize grapefruit marketing orders. This bill recently passed the Senate for the second year in a row and I am hopeful that this year the House will act favorably on this proposal. This bill will allow grapefruit growers who assess handlers for marketing promotion to also allow credits against such assessments in the case of those handlers who make direct expenditures for marketing promotion. Specifically. handlers of Florida Indian River grapefruit will be encouraged to continue developing their own promotions by crediting the cost of these promotions against the handlers assessment as authorized in the Indian River grapefruit marketing order. A favorable recommendation was made by the Department of Agriculture on this legislation. and it is supported by the Indian River Citrus League which represents the vast majority of Indian River citrus growers. This is enabling legislation only. and the Indian River grapefruit industry will still have to adopt a specific program agreeable to them. This bill will merely give maximum flexibility to those involved in marketing Indian River grapefruit. For promotional purposes under the existing marketing order. individual handlers are assessed so much per box of fruit to promote Indian River fruit. If. however. these handlers use the words \"Indian River\" in their own promotion. they should receive some credit toward their promotional assessment. This legislation would allow them to do that. This bill is Important in amending a program that is being improved through local initiative and cooperation. I believe this type of activity should not be impeded. and I hope my colleagues will concur in passing this bill.",

Mr. President. that simply is impossible for us to comply with. The purpose of these committees is to afford people an opportunity to give to a large agenda of candidates. and we cannot adequately support a House or a Senate candidate who is a viable candidate in any other sense of the word with that limitation.

Each block would contain some 10 billion rads of radioactivityenough to kill everyone in the nation if dispersed in the air. The cylinders are to be lowered 1.000 feet below the surface of the Lyons Mine and dropped by remote control in holes bored in the salt.. At present. they say there is no information as to what will happen next. But there are fears the cylinders could melt right .through the salt or the waste could react with minute amounts of water in the salt and cause an explosion that would vent radioactivity to the surface. The AEC has told the states geologists the heat over a period of time will raise the temperature of the surface only 1 degree. But the Kansas scientists dispute this. saying it could rise 13 degrees and change the surface environment considerably. Again. no one is certain. Opposition to underground burial of nu.clear wastes already has stymied the AEC in Idaho and Washington.

Mr. President. it just seems to me that. barring any jusification from the administration for maintaining a military assistance program which is being used by the Chilean junta to continue the repression of their own people. I strongly urge the passage of this amendment. Chile has fundamentally violated every basic human right which we and they as signatories of the United Nations declaration have sworn to protect. It just seems to me that there has to be a better justification than saying we ought to give the Secretary of State a little more time to see what he can do to try and remedy this situation. The violations are continuing. ongoing. as recent as the last few weeks. The documentation of it is clear and compelling. It seems to me other countries of the world have led the way. and that the United States. in this. which I think is an extremely modest way. should indicate that we are at least attaching an importance to human rights and liberties of people in Chile and throughout the world greater than that which we attach to the continuation of military aid and support to a dictatorial regime. Mr. President. I would like to have a vote on this amendment. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time. but I want a vote. so I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

The way we can best do that is for the United States to become a mediator. with clout on both sides. because they trust us to be fair in that. But we find the Members of this body voting. instead. to take a side. and virtually rule out a settlement. That is an illustration. I repeat. Mr. President. of how not to make foreign policy. or how to downgrade the role of the Senate in being responsible for foreign policy decisions. Now. in this particular case. in the case of Chile. it seems to me that much ought to be done. and must be done. in achieving a new balance in human rights everywhere and anywhere. but we have to be careful of the device that we employ as we weigh our policy. and the consequences. These pressures are on now. We are not going to change the inner workings of Chile overnight. even with this act. What we may do. as a consequence. is harden the position of the group that is in power now and seeking to survive. and delay still longer the process of a constitutional change. To be sure. not too much has happened in 1 year. They have not made enough progress in directions we would all like to see. and particularly with the historical experience of Chile. which was the most promising of all the democracies in the hemisphere for so long. The tragedy of the last year is deep with all of us. I simply raise serious doubts about this as the technique for bringing about a change. We must be careful not to discourage it. rather than help it along. We have many ways to keep the process going. I gave the Senate an illustration a moment ago about one of the important results. achieved quietly. without any fanfare. without any stress. in inducing them to defer a decision to execute some of the prisoners. This happened during the course of the committees consideration of the new foreign assistance money for military equipment.",

The untimely loss of this great President of the little people is deeply felt by us all. The fact that he rose from the reactionary southern resistance to the challenges of changeto become the greatest Innovator of social change in modern America. indeed. marks the true greatness of President Johnson. Lyndon Johnson was a unique man. a rare man who realized that the force of freedom is a neverceasing and unstoppable force. He was a southerner. but yet refused as President to be bound by the tragedies of sectional hatred and regional perception. There have been and will continue to be many comparisons- made between President Johnson and his colleague in the Presidency. Abraham Lincoln. Many of these comparisons are valid. But a quality which Mr. Johnson possessed singularly was the ability to do what was right on the sole grounds that it was right. His administration should not be remembered for the great amount of social legislation it produced and Initiated as law. But rather it should be remembered. not in the annals of history. but in the lives of our people as having served as an agent of freedoms mission and a commander in the Nations war with itself.

I have got a rather concise analysis from an Independent agency. the Library of Congress. that refers in the nature of a white paper to the impoundment actions that are currently being taken by the administration. Contrary to the allegations of the administration that only 3.5 percent of the budget is being impounded as opposed to perhaps 6 percent that has been impounded in years past. the Library in its analysis points out that in fact the current administration is impounding in excess of $18 billion. As opposed to actions in the past where impoundments were spent 99 percent thereof over a period of several years. the current impoundments are not being spent at all. The analysis further alleges that in fact the will of the Congress and the will of the American people are being unconstitutionally thwarted by the President of the United States. I would particularly again refer my colleagues to the text of the Library analysis which appears later in these proceedings.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. American consumers are forced to pay over $1 billion annually in unnecessary prescription costs because of prohibitions on retail drug price advertising. overprotective patent laws. exorbitant promotional expenditures by industry and unreasonable markups. These are among the findings of an 18month study conducted by my staff in New York and in Washington. Americans are spending some $7 billion annually on prescription drugsabout $33 for each man. woman and childand the evidence is strong that they are being overcharged. on the average. by at least 25 percent. One reason for this. we found Is a callous disregard for the financial plight of consumers. especially the elderly. on the part of drug manufacturers. retail pharmacists and State pharmacy boards. The report also documents the huge disparity in the prices for identical pre.. scriptions at different pharmacies in the same community. We surveyed over 120 pharmacies in Queens and in the Washington. D.C.. area to compare retail prescription prices under a variety of conditions. The survey revealed markups generally averaged in excess of 200 percent. Pricing was grossly inconsistent. even among stores of the same chain for the same prescription. Price advertising of drugs. extensively used on the wholesale level. is banned on the retail level in 37 States. including New York State. This double standard results in a wide disparity of prices for identical drugs. from store to store and. in some instances even from customer to customer at the same store. The drug retailer is able to benefit from manufacturers vigorous price competition. but he denies that same right to the consumer. To correct some of the glaring abuses uncovered by the study. I am introducing legislation to accomplish the following: First. An end to all prohibitions on retail prescription drug price advertising. Second. The mandatory posting of prices for the 100 most commonly prescribed drugs. Third. The open dating of all perishable prescription drugs. showing clearly on the dispensed products label the date beyond which the potency is diminished or the chemical composition altered by age.",

Cannella said that Mr. Ricord was responsible for drug dealing that produced death and hardships that \"probably would equal the Vietnam war casualties.\" The U.S. Attorneys office estimates that Ricords organization was responsible for bringing 2.000 pounds of heroin a year into the United States since It is social injustice that men responsible for so much destruction in this country can be locked away for such short periods of time. These drug operators should be imprisoned for at least 20 years simply to take them out of circulation and protect society from them.

Mr. IAchtenwalter began his distinguished career as a legislator in 1939 with his election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. continued serving through his subsequent election as Speaker of the House in the Commonwealth. and culminated his service in the years he spent in Congress. Throughout his entire legislative career he displayed a sincere devotion to duty and a genuine desire to faithfully serve the interests of his constituents. Frank Lichtenwalters keen understanding of the legislative process proved to be a valuable asset both for his constituents and for those State legislators and Members of Congress who were privileged to serve with him. Although he chose not to continue in Congress beyond 1951. he remained active in the business sphere as an employee of the Pennsylvania Electric Association. of which he was serving as vice president and managing director at the time of his death. His deep interest in community affairs were reflected by the terms he served on the board of Pennsylvania Blue Shield. Community General Osteopathic Hospital. and the Lehigh Valley Motor Club.

That is going to add to our image in the Senate and in Congress. if this addition is approved in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. There has been no discussion here as to how much money is available that Is unspent under this program. That is a very important factor to consider. There -is presently available under title I. the revenue sharing. 80 percent of which can be devoted by the political subdivisions of this country to public service employment. $1.580 billion. Under this program. title II. known as public employment programs for areas comprising at least 61/2 percent unemployed. $1 billion. We have not spent at this rate for the last 2 fiscal years. So we are adding more. to pile up more carryoyer funds for the subsequent fiscal years. That is what we have to face here before we approve of $400 million for the revenuesharing part. which this amendment .is intended. for. and $100 million for public service jobs under title II. How can we justify appropriating another $500 million which is not represented by a budget request when we have a carryover of $600 million of 1974 funds? Are we going to appropriate $500 million to add ornament to the almost $2.5 billion that Is available and unspent. and which has been carried over. some from previous fiscal years? That is what Is at issue here. If the Senate wants to tarnish the image of Congress by appropriating $500 million. which is not represented by any budget request. let us go ahead and do it.

I would just like to call the attention of the Senator and the Senate to the fact that 6 days ago Secretary Brennan. of the Department of Labor. based upon the information that he had. allocated $350 million for public service jobs. He announced the allocation of $350 million to States and localities with substantial unemployment. making it possible for them to create some 73.000 public service jobs. This completes the funding requested by President Ford at a White House meeting on September 11 with national labor leaders. Within 48 hours of that meeting. Secretary Brennan had allocated $65 million. The current action brings the total to $415 million. creating a total of 85.000 jobs. Distribution of the $350 million has begun. and hiring can start immediately. You cannot even hire that number of people overnight. The $350 million was authorized by title II of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act at the administrations fiscal 1975 appropriation request level. The aim of title II is to give the unemployed transitional public service employment in areas of substantial unemployment. The funds include $280 million. 80 percent. for State and local governments with areas having substantial. 6.5 percent or higher. unemployment 3 straight months. The amounts were determined by the number of unemployed living In each area compared to the number of unemployed living in all such areas of substantial unemployment. Seventy million dollars. 20 percent. is. at the Secretarys discretion. also for States and localities most severely affected by unemployment. and having a 6.5 percent or higher unemployment. Then It goes on to outline the present $350 million combined with $620 million distributed since June. making a total of $970 million. and can provide some 70.000 public service jobs this coming winter.

That is the purpose of community improvement projects approach. I do not think you can say that applies to just the mere additional funding of the public service jobs in the Employment Training Act.

Indeed. the report indicates that the express purpose of the committee amendment to section 7(b) was to clarify this issue. However. I have read the committee amendment to section 7(b) with great care and it is extremely difficult for me to see how the adopted language clarifies the position of the Government Operations Committee. I cannot see how it is clear from this language that it is the Federal regulatory agency. rather than the Administrator. which has the authority to determine when the Administrators submissions may be simultaneous with that of other parties. and when they may not. Hopefully. the amendment I am offering will make it explicit that it is the regulatory agency which is granted authority to determine when the Administrator may present material in informal agency activities. I fully realize that this intent may be clear in light of the Government Operations report. However. this matter involves a vast number of agency activities which may become the subject of ACA intervention. I feel. therefore. that an issue of this magnitude should not have its resolution rest on an interpretation of legislative history. but rather should be contained in the clear and explicit language of the bill itself. I would therefore urge that this clarifying amendment be supported by the full Senate. as we have supported its intent by adopting the Government Operations amendment to section 7(b).",

Today I have some excerpts from letters from Virginians that I would like to share with my colleagues in the Senate. My mail is overwhelmingly in opposition to this bill. I have before me an article written by James J. Kilpatrick. It is entitled \"A Monstrously Bad Bill.\" Mr. Kilpatrick is a former editor of the Richmond News Leader. He is a distinguished journalist and columnist. one who is familiar. I believe. to every Member of this body. Mr. Kilpatrick says it is the worst bill of the 93d Congress. He admits that it is a considerable sweep. But he says it is a monstrously bad bill. He continues: In the holy name of consumerism. one of the more fashionable religions of the day. the Congress could create a bureaucratic nightmare. The sponsors and defenders of this bill make it sound so simple. Out of the whole cloth they have fashioned a speechless dummy named The Consumer. The poor creature. it is said. has no one to defend his interests. Business and industry have highly paid lobbyists. whose insidious talent is to manipulate the agency set up for their regulation. The consumer. by contrast. is an abandoned babe in the forest of wolves. The bill would create a new agency with authority to fight back on his behalf. Mr. Kilpatrick suggests that the theory rests on a false premise that there is such a thing as the consumer. And yet the definition in the bill refers to every human being. Mr. President. in the interest of time. rather than to attempt further to dissect this article. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed at this point in the RECORD in its entirety. as it appeared in the Washington Post on August 12. 1974.",

S. 707. The alternative I am introducing Is a substitute amendment. It was created by taking the best provisions of the Senate and the House bills and putting them all together in this substitute. The substitute resolves the key issue of the labor exemption to the satisfaction. I believe. of all those who have been concerned that consumer interests would not be represented in this area. The issues making the Senate bill a likely veto candidate have been deleted. These issues are the term and removal of the Administrator. the OMB bypass. and the independent interrogatory power. The Senate provisions on FCC and small business are retained. Finally. provisions have been included to prevent a selfdefeating possibility that ACA actions might drive farmers out of business in the interest of low food prices for consumers. I talked and discussed with the majority and minority managers of the Senate bill and believe that the substitute is acceptable to them. In fact. they so stated earlier in the day. My amendment retains those provisions of the House bill which make it more acceptable to the private sector and the Federal agencies. yet it includes a number of the Senate provisions which are better and more concisely drafted. We are all concerned about protecting the interests of consumers and many have questioned whether the Agency for Consumer Advocacy would actually protect the interests of consumers. I believe this substitute will provide meaningful representation for consumers. At the same time. it will not create a superagency that will harass or meddle in our great private enterprise sector.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the bill before the Senate today is designed to require that any imitation political item be plainly and permanently marked with the calendar year of its manufacture and that any imitation numismatic item be marked \"copy.\" Failure to take this action would constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Recognizing this need. I introduced S. 1880 on May 23 of this year and am pleased that it has received favorable consideration by the Senate Commerce Committee. It has been estimated that there are more than 1 million persons in the United States today who collect coins. tokens. paper money. and commemorative medals. A smaller. but nevertheless steadily increasing number of Americans are engaged in collecting political items. Millions of dollars are spent each year by collectors of numismatic and political items. It is. therefore. not surprising that a prosperous business in imitation items has emerged. Most imitation numismatic items are produced in Europe. the Near East. and Southeast Asia. Unfortunately. some of these fake items have been sold as original for thousands of dollars each. It is this danger which my bill seeks to prevent. Fake items should not be traded as originals. and the possibility for that to happen would be eliminated if my bill is enacted into law. Mr. President. the production of imitation coins and political items threatens the value of the original pieces. They create havoc in the world of the people who collect them. and there is nothing in the present law to prevent this deception. While the U.S. Secret Service does excellent work in controlling the counterfeiting of current U.S. coins. there is no provision of law which regulates the everincreasing tide of copies of noncurrent coins. Mr. President. my proposed legislation. S. 1880. is identical to H.R. 5777. sponsored in the current session of Congress by Representatives ECKHARDT and Moss. The House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce estimated the cost of the bill at $50.000 for each of the next 5 fiscal years. The House passed H.R. 5777 on May 16 by an overwhelming majority.",

That does not require him to break a strike and go back to work. but he must sign up for work. In addition to that. if he has as much as $1.500 in liquid assets. he is not entitled to get food stamps under any conditions. The problem arises because the Department and agencies concerned have been dilatory In permitting people to sign up for stamps in violation of the law. In accordance with that fact. on page 40 of our conference report. we state that we: deplore the lack of enforcement of existing food stamp regulations which require that an ablebodied person in the household register for employment \"including a person who is not working because of a strike or lockout at his usual place of employment.\" It is the specific intent of the Conferees that this provision of the regulations be rigidly and uniformly enforced by the Department of Agriculture and those agencies administering the program at the local level under the auspices of the Department. Eligibility of strikers for food stamps should be carefully scrutinized prior to certification and certification made only In those cases where the household of the Individual striker applicant meets all of the requirements of eligibility as in the case of other applicants.",

I join in the remarks made by the Speaker to pay tribute to our distinguished Parliamentarian for 46 years. Lew Deschler. He clearly merits high marks of excellence for an outstanding performance of dedicated service to the House of Representatives for nearly a half a century. When Lew first came to the House in 1925. he was eager to learn everything about House procedures and enthusiastic about the task before him. He has brought to his position a keen legal mind and a remembrance for House precedents unparalleled in this institution. Conscientious devotion to his duties. hard work. and a willingness to share his knowledge with others. have earned him the praise and gratitude. the respect. and admiration of all Members and House employees alike. Whether he was presiding over monumental legislative business or counseling Members on the correct procedure to instruct conferees. or advising Speakers on the correct ruling on a point or order against a nongermane amendmentLew took his job seriously and performed each succeeding task with equal diligence and resourcefulness. I know that the Speaker has valued his counsel. and I. as majority leader. have often sought advice and received from Lew a very adroit and thorough response to my procedural inquiries. All of us who have served in the House with you. Lew. are deeply indebted to the excellence that you have brought to the parliamentary decisions governing this body. We wish you the very best in retirement and are all happy to learn that you will still be working with us as a special counsel until you finish the task of compiling the House precedents. I take this time to extend to you. Lew. sincere gratitude and appreciation for a job well done. I was talking with my good friend on the phone last night. our former. and beloved Speaker John McCormack. Were he here. he. too. would join in thanking you for your devotion to duty and undivided loyal service to him during his tenure as Speaker of the House. Mr. Speaker.

The resolution we have adopted today in the House underscores the feelings of this body that Lew Deschler has been a credit to his position as Parliamentarian of the House and an invaluable asset to the daytoday legislative activities of the Congress. Born in Chillicothe. Ohiowhich is near my congressional districtLew Deschler began his congressional service with his appointment in December 1925. as a Speakers messenger. Two years later. he was named an Assistant Parliamentarian of the House and in 1928. Lew became the Parliamentarian. His dedication to this job and his extensive knowledge of the duties of that post have not gone unrecognized. In 1970. he was named the recipient of the Ohio Governors Award and. in the same year. he was the first to be honored by the John W. McCormack Award for House service. His responsibilities in the House during the past 40 years have involved advising the Speaker. the majority leader. the minority leader as well as Members of the House on important parliamentary procedures. His advice and counsel on a wide range of subjects has been sought many times over and I know that we are all grateful for his cooperation and expertise. Lew literally watched history in the making in this Chamber and he can take a great deal of pride in knowing that he was part of it. It is an honor to join in this tribute to Lew Deschler and I commend him for his outstanding contributions to the House.",

Lewis Deschler. the most skilled and knowledgeable Parliamentarian ever to serve the House. will be bringing to a close nearly a half century of service on Capitol Hill. Appointed messenger at the Speakers table as a youth in December 1925. his brilliance rapidly established itself. In January 1927. he became Assistant Parliamentarian and. in 1928. Parliamentarian. an office he has filled ever since with the greatest honor and ability. Lew Deschler was admitted to the District of Columbia bar in 1934. the U.S. Supreme Court bar in 1937. His honors and awards and achievements are numberless. but among them are the Recipient Governors Award. Ohio. 1970. Delta Tau Delta Distinguished Service Chapter. 1964. the first annual John W. McCormack Award. 1970. the Doormens Society \"Man of the Year Award.\" 1973. He served as assistant secretary of the American Group of Interparliamentary Union Convention in London in 1930. But the greatest awards and tributes are those returned to Lew almost daily in the form of the often unspoken gratitude we feel to him for his wise counsel. his neverfailing courtesy. his affability. his quick wit. his amiable ability to always find time in his spectacularly crowded schedule to help out a Member or a staff person. Lew Deschler has madt. a lasting imprint on Capitol Hill as editor of the House Rules and Manual. from 1929 to 1973. He is leaving some mighty big boots to fill. I must say I feel. though I know good men will follow him. almost sorry for new Members in the next Congress who will not have the guidance and advice of this superb Parliamentarian. not know the warmth of the friendship of this great man. I have always felt a particular bond with Lew. because he was born in Chillicothe. Ohio. which happens to be where my family put down its roots in public life more than a century ago. It is an honor to join with a multitude of Lew Deschlers friends and admirers today to wish him Godspeed as he closes this long and distinguished chapter in his career.

Along with my colleague. Representative KENNETH GRAY I am today introducing legislation which would rescue a familiar old Washington landmark from the wreckers ball. and turn it into a home for the Endowment. The building in question is the old Romanesque Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue with its marvelous interior galleries and its spacious. skylighted central courtyard. The rehabilitation of the Old Post Office could be the focal point for the revitalizing of Pennsylvania Avenue. providing a lively blend of cultural and commercial activities as well as office space for local and Federal Government agencies and private organizations. The building could serve as a showcase for outstanding graphics. furnishings. and interior design. In keeping with the recent Executive order calling for Federal stewardship in the area of historic preservation. the building could exemplify the adaptative use possibilities of older buildings. The historic nature of the Old Post Office as well as Its location makes it a highly appropriate setting for a variety of projects relating to the Nations Bicentennial Celebration. Mr. Speaker. I cannot think of a better way to revitalize our Avenue of the Presidents for the Nations Bicentennial. A text of the bill follows: H.R. 13860 A bill to direct the Administrator of the General Services Administration to transfer the Old Post Office Building located in the District of Columbia to the National Endowment for the Arts Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That the Administrator of thc General Services Administration shall transfer. without reimbursement. to the National Endowment for the Arts the Old Post Office Building. and the accompanying real property. located between Eleventh and Twelfth Streets and C and D Streets Northwest in the District of Columbia. SEC. 2. The transfer provided by the first section of this Act shall be made at such time as the Administrator of the General Services Administration determines that the use of the Old Post Office Building by the Federal Government is no longer essential. but in any event such transfer shall be made within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.",

There are a great many reasons for this including many which are entirely valid. But at the very time when our institutions are undet fireand rightly sowe should not overlook some of the constructive actions which our society and our Government has taken in recent years. While there is much to be criticized and despaired about. we should nevertheless not despair. There is no need to throw in the towel on America. The fact that those at the highest levels of our Government could engage in acts which have resulted in indictments or convictions of crime. and be caught and made to pay for their transgressions. indicates that the system still works and still functions. In most societies those who hold power in the Cabinet. at the highest levels of the executive branch. or as the No. 2 man of the Government. could commit these kinds of transgressions and remain immune from indictment or conviction.

And certainly. this fact is no more evident than in the area of humanitarian food assistance. Increasingly. the United States is being forced into the position of determining who will have enough to eat and who will hunger as our food production becomes the residual supply throughout the world. This fall we will join most other countries of the world in a major conference on food. One of the most Important issues to be addressed by this meeting is the strengthening of world food security through coordinated food assistance and emergency food relief. But unless the United States goes to this conference with a clear perspective of what our own policies and commitments are in regard to humanitarian fooa assistance. international initiatives in this area are not likely to be substantive. The approach of a major world conference on food only points out the timeliness of a review of U.S. food aid policy In terms of the adequacy of present efforts as well as what commitments we can expect to make in the future. With this interest. the Subcommittee on Foreign Agricultural Policy will conduct a hearing on April 4. on current and future U.S. policies in regard to food assistance to the developing world. From this session. the subcommittee hopes to be able to report on our short-. medium-. and longterm policies in relation to foreign food aid. We will review U.S. priorities for food assistance both geographically as well as by program vehicle. The subcommittee will explore how U.S. policymakers view the future structure of our commitments to the lessdeveloped countries in terms of cash. food. and technical assistance. Finally. we will attempt to get a feeling for what commitments the United States Is going to be able to make at the food conference. on international efforts to relieve world hunger. Testifying on these issues will be the Honorable Clayton Yeutter. Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs. Mr. Daniel Parker. Administrator. Agency for International Development. Mr. James Grant. president. Overseas Development Council. and Mr. Frank Goffio. representing the American Council of Voluntary Agenices for Foreign Service. Inc.

Western City magazine. the official municipal magazine of the West. carried a series of articles discussing the important challenges of community development. and how three communities in California are working to meet them. In one of the articles. Mr. Elder Gunter. city manager of Stockton. Calif.. describes how that community has sought to put to best use the various forms of Federal community development assistance it receives. In order to solve the problems of a community--or a nation for that matterit is incumbent to understand fully those problems. their sources. extent. and means to go about relieving them. Stockton is taking the lead with the creation of its Stockton neighborhood analysis program (SNAP). which is designed. as Mr. Gunter writes. to provide city managementWith a valuable tool which will provide reliable uptodate information to assist in making realistic and meaningful decisions. an essential requirement in meeting the challenges of the future. In order to acquaint the Senate with this innovative local program. I ask unanimous consent to have the abovementioned article printed in the RECORD.",

I was very pleased that the Senate passed a strong election reform bill last April. including public financing. This measure is now in HouseSenate conference. But the movement for reform of the electoral process has not been limited to Washington. On June 4. 1974. California voters expressed overwhelming support for political reform by casting over 3 million votesa 2 to 1 marginin support of proposition 9. the Political Reform Act of 1974. The act was put before the voters by a coalition of publicinterest groups and individuals. including Peoples Lobby. Common Cause. and the League of Women Voters. The initiative process. through which proposition 9 was brought before the voters of California. has been an active and progressive force in California. Just 2 years before. California voters enacted proposition 20 which provided the first comprehensive coastal protection and planning in the Nation. In light of the great interest in proposition 9. and the political reform movement. I would like to share with my colleagues a summary of the provisions of proposition 9 compiled by the California Journal. and an article from the Los Angeles Times outlining the genesis of the act. I hope the success of proposition 9 in California. and of the campaign reform bill in the Congress. will usher in a new era of openness and grassroots responsiveness on the part of politicians.

I think he has made an unanswerable argument here on the merits or the demerits of the amendment itself. even though not a single Member here is indifferent to any problem our friends. the Senators from California. have. I have been for a long time interested in the daylight saving bill. and I have been. along with many others. working on this bill for months. I have not found a single Senator who was against the idea of making some adjustment in the present law as to daylight saving. But there is a difference of opinion among us. Some wanted to have 6 months of daylight saving time and 6 months of what I call regular time. and others wanted the division of 8 and 4. Others wanted 9 and 3. So after conferring. discussing and debating ideas we finally came to a conclusion we could all stand on together. and this bill provides for the 8 and. 4 division of the months. the 4 months being November. December. January. and February. I think it is generally agreed that there is no substantial saving in energy today by the present law. and it is also agreed that there are many other very strong reasons. including the idea of the schools and school children getting back on a more practical time. So I certainly hope. the. bill will pass in its present form and it will not even have to go back to conference. just go directly to the White House where. I am sure. it will. be favorably received. Many of our transportation systems and many other. interested parties will get a chance to change schedules. adjust to it. It Is not something that can be done overnight. We owe it to those people to give them a reasonable time. I thank the Senator very much for yielding.",

That helps tremendously in terms of our problems of balance of payments. It seems to me that the Senators opposing this because of one winery in their State are those providing special interest opposition to a general interest amendment. I do not know whether the Senator from Alabama has any one winery that he is speaking on behalf of. but I know there are Senators who have that situation. It seems to me they are speaking against the best interests of the consumers of this country generally and the consumers in their States who do not have the free choice at the same price of wine.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. there is -just one point Iwould like to make. The Senators from California. in the amendment they have offered.. are not trying to tell the State of Alabama which wines can be sold. nor whether wines can even be sold. The State of Alabama would have a perfect right to decide these issues for itself. The only thing the amendment says is that if Alabama decides to sell wine it should not discriminate against wine that is produced out of State any more than it should be able to discriminate against any other product that is produced out of State. I might say to the Senator from Alabama that in his State the annual license fee for all manufacturers of alcoholic beverages. including wine. is $1.000 for place of manufacture. But. the annual fee is. only $25 for wine manufacturers producing wine in which 75 percent or more of the fruit or produce used in the manufacture of such wine is grown in Alabama. . In other words. an Alabama winemaker utilizing more than 25 percent of fruit grown out of State to make his wine would be discriminated against by being required to pay an annual license fee of $1.000. and that is a very substantial discrimination. Of course. it is clear that that additional cost is going to be passed on to the consumers of Alabama if they want to drink California wines. New York wines. or any othei- outofState wine. I just do not believe It is fair to the consumers of Alabama any more than it would be fair to the consumers of California for our State to impose a big tax on Alabama cotton. We have got a great grade of cotton in Alabama and I like cotton shirts. I think it would be an outrage if in New York or California we put a big tax on Alabama cotton. \ufffd I do not think Alabama should put a big tax on California wine.",

For months. various Members of the Senate have been warning the administration that we faced a major fuel shortage this summer and outlined a number of realistic and hardhitting proposals to deal with this situation. Indeed. I think it is fair to say the Senate has provided the only leadership in developing the programs necessary to see our Nation through this critical period. And I think there is no question that the Senates contributions on the energy issue are due in large measure to the splendid leadership of my distinguished colleague. Senator JACKSON. In my judgment. no elected official in America possesses more knowledge and expertise on this critical problem than Senator JACKSON.

Senator JACKSON was the author of the Emergency Fuel Allocation Act. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with him on this bill in the Interior Committee and to have supported it on the Senate floor. In my judgment. his legislation provides a rational. equitable and workable plan to meet the fuel needs of our Nation during the present situation. For this reason.

More and more. we are being forced to turn to other forms of energy. with nuclear energy promising to be the fuel of the future. As evidence of this increase in nuclear power. by the end of 1972 this Nation had 27 nuclear electric generating units operating. 55 in various stages of construction or in the review process for operating licenses. and 34 units now awaiting clearance for construction permits. However. as all of my colleagues know. this tremendous expansion in nuclear generating capacities carries enormous responsibilities. which are borne by the dedicated and highly competent personnel of the Atomic Energy Commission.

Providing quality health care is an immensely complex challenge. requiring a committment not only to the daily needs of millions of Americans. but also to the longterm requirements of research and training. In recent years the Federal Government has been a key participant in the rapid growth of medical knowledge and health care services. Government sponsored and subsidized health programs can be credited with substar tial contributions to the significant improvements that have characterized health care in the last decade. Medical education and research are a critical component of the continuing quest for improved health care. Yet administration proposals now before Congress would cripple the medical education and research programs that have supported the medical education institutions of our Nation and have resulted in the training of many competent physicians and medical scientists and educators. I feel privileged to have recently received a statement on this subject from Dr. Ephraim Friedman. dean of the Boston University School of Medicine. Dr. Friedman focuses on the proposals to severely restrict eligibility for Federal medical school scholarships. the proposed termination of the National Institutes of Health research grant program. and the general effects of the proposed budgetary reductions upon medical schools. their faculty. medical students. and the overall quality of health care services. I believe Dr. Friedmans views to be remarkably penetrating and forceful. and I urge my fellow colleagues to study them carefully:",

Yet despite the demonstrated need for competent and trained nurses. the administration proposes to phase out categorical support for nursing education. The results of these proposalsif enacted by Congresswill be close to disastrous. Capitation grants for nursing would be terminated. and scholarship and loan support for nursing students would be drastically curtailed. If these proposed reductions are imposed. then it is not unreasonable to expect that as many as 50 percent of all nursing students will be left without adequate financial resources to meet the costs of their education. Faculties at nursing schools will have to be heavily reduced. Most important. quantity and the quality of nursing care will in the long run be diminished. Last week I met with educators and administrators from four nursing schools in the Boston area: Dr. Irene S. Palmer. dean and professor. Boston University School of Nursing. Mary A. Dineen. R.N.. Ed.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have today reintroduced a bill calling for the expansion of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to include two elected town or township officials. The Advisory Commission was created to. among other things: (B)ring together representatives of the Federal. State. and local governments for the consideration of common problems.-42 U.S.C. sec. 4273(1). While I have always viewed inclusion on the Commission of elected town or township officials as sensible and appropriate. recent legislative action by the Congress has made the case for representation even stronger. I refer to the enactment of the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972. better known as general revenue sharing. Section 108 of that act expressly included in the allocation formula for units of Government. township governments. While the Office of Revenue Sharing has not yet compiled figures on what proportion of the $1.5 billion distributed thus far has gone to township governments. it is clear that a substantial amount is going to that level of Government. To state it simply. the question of general revenue sharing funds and how to use them is another one of the \"common\" problems that is to be dealt with by the ACIR and in recognizing the status of township governments for revenuesharing purposes. we have acknowledged these governmental entities as one of the levels of Government whose \"relations\" with other levels is clearly within the ambit of the ACIR. In conclusion. I hope that favorable consideration can be given this legislation during this Congress and I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge and sincerely thank one of my constituents. Col. Joseph Parisi of Kalamazoo. who as a former elected township official and as executive director of the Michigan Townships Association. has been extremely helpful in presenting to me the precise nature and importance of township government in Michigan and many other States.

Mr. Speaker. I have had the immense privilege of meeting many Israeli leaders. including the distinguished Premier. Golda Meir. That was an experience that I shall always treasure.

This celebration Is especially important to those of Rumanian ancestry because their great desire for freedom has been suppressed by the Communist regime in their homeland. On May 10. 1866. Prince Charles of HohenzollernSigmaringen was proclaimed Prince of Rumania. culminating a long struggle of the Rumanian people to gain this right. Rumania declared its complete independence from the Ottoman Empire 11 years later. on May 10. 1877. during the RussoTurkish War. This status was confirmed by European nations at the Conference of Berlin of 1878. Four years after this. on May 10. 1881. Charles I was crowned as the first king. by the will of the people. Thus began the Kingdom of Rumania. which represented a free and prosperous period for the Rumanian people. Throughout the entire period from 1881 to the present. May 10 has been a time to celebrate the achievement of freedom for the Rumanian people. It is also the symbol of the struggle for freedom which the Rumanian people have endured in the past and are continuing. I join with all Rumanians in the celebration of this great event in their history. and in ther efforts toward the freedom which they so much cherish.",

I want to make it clear again that it is the full intent of the Congress that the funds under section 811 which are native American program funds are to be spent for Indian people. However. there are some Indian programs which are. in some instances. supplying needs to people other than Indians. They are doing so with funds received from a number of sources. one of which would be section 811 funds. It should be clear that they can proceed in these combination programs without being subject to having their section 811 funds taken from them or not being able to have the funds even though the other funds which they are receiving extended for nonIndian programs. But by the same token. it should be clear that the Office of Native American Program funds. section 811 funds. shall be spent for the benefit of Indian people. To give an example. we have a health program in the Seattle area in which probably 90 percent of the recipients are native Americans. but the board is composed of again mostly native Americans but some others. and some other services are provided for other than native Americans.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I will speak just a few minutes on this matter. I want to share with each of you the experience in the 16th Congressional District of Ohio with community action services. First. the community action services program has served as a community ombudsman in providing help to many of the poor people who have benefited from this program. It has been a community action agency providing access for the poor to many other programs that are of great service to them and to those who do not have the sophistication necessary to use other community services both public and private. Second. we have not experienced politicization of the agency. The agency in the 16th district has remained free from political activities. and has accomplished the objectives that were envisioned by the creators of the Office of Economic Opportunity. This is not to say that there have not been problems. but in the past year the agency has been working very well in meeting its objectives. Third. it was interesting to me to receive a letter from the Ohio Water Well Contractors and Equipment Association strongly supporting this bill and stating in their letter that the impoverished portion of rural Ohio has received great benefits from the action of these agencies. This is an area that is overlooked in many instances as we discuss only the big city problems. not fully realizing that in the Appalachia area of Ohio and similar rural areas where they need assistance in developing self help programs. that the Office of Economic Opportunity has worked quite well in providing the kind of services that will improve the quality of life in these areas. Fourth. the community action program in the 16th district has recruited many volunteers thereby substantially enhancing the assistance provided to the poor at no additional cost to the taxpayer. This program of volunteer action has an added benefit of creating community awareness of the problems of the poor and thereby developing local permanent solutions.",

The study would be carried out in cooperation with the Federal Council on Aging. Mr. Speaker. one of the most vexing problems I have witnessed since I came to Congress involves the interaction of Government programs intended to aid the elderly poor. I refer to the negative impact that an increase in benefits from one program may have on an older persons eligibility for benefits from another. Many of the elderly poor now find that they are on a treadmill. No sooner do they receive increased cash benefits from one sourcesocial security. for examplethan they are faced with the prospect of a rent increase in public housing or a cut in veterans pensions or the loss of eligibility for food stamps. In part. these problems arise because programs for the elderly are operated by a vast array of Government agencies. each with their own regulations and legislative authorizations. Clearly. a comprehensive review of these programs is needed in an effort to bring about greater uniformity and consistency in program standards. Section 610 of H.R. 14449 now authorizes the Director of the Community Services Agency to \"initiate and maintain interagency liaison with all other appropriate Federal agencies to achieve a coordinated national approach to the needs of the elderly poor.\" Section 610 also authorizes the CSA Director \"to carry out investigations and studies which would assist the elderly poor to achieve selfsufficiency.\" It would seem. then. that the initiation of a study of the interrelationship of Federal benefit programs. as authorized in our amendment. represents a logical extension of the authority already provided the Director of the Community Services Agency in section 610 of this act.

House Resolution 389 provides that points of order against the bill for failure to comply with the provisions of clause 2. rule XXIprohibiting appropriations without authorizations and legislation in appropriations billsand clause 5. rule XXIprohibiting reappropriationsare waived. Without this waiver. points of order could be made against the bill in numerous places. Approximately 86 percent of the $2.855.542.209 recommended in the bill is for programs that are totally or virtually uncontrollable. Included in this category are: For pay costs. $899.891.900. For grants to States for public assistance. $614.066.000. For flood and disaster relief programs. $370.248.000. For payment to the Civil Service Retirement fund. $190.900.000. For retired military pay. $87.000.000. For firefighting costs. $57.638.000. For Federal workmens compensation benefits. $26.300.000. For various claims and judgments against the government Including Vietnam prisoner of war claims. $36.568.059. For military mail privileges and postal costs. $32.700.000. Another 8 percent of the funds in the bill. $226.510.000. is allocated for higher education. Title I of the bill provides for general supplementals.

I almost had to pinch myself to wonder whether I was in the land of the living when I picked up this rule and found that all points of order to this omnibus deficiency appropriation bill are to be waived. It is my understanding that there are some 100 provisions in this bill that would be subject. in the absence of this rule. to points of order. I simply do not understand what has come over the House of Representatives that they would even think of considering an appropriation bill of this magnitude. an omnibus deficiency appropriation bill calling for the spending of more than $2.8 billion. under a waiver of points of order. It is hard for me to conceive that this could happen in the House of Representatives. I can understand a rule making in order an appropriation bill under emergency conditions. with limited points of order. But what has become of the rules of regular and orderly procedure in the House of Representatives when this sort of thing can take place? What is the necessity for the harsh procedure here proposed? The ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations when this bill was reported to the House reserved all points of order which. of course. would have made points of order in order if the bill was considered under ordinary procedures. Why go through that charade if the Committee on Rules is to come forth with a rule waiving all points of order? Read this bill. It is scarcely a deficiency appropriation bill. It is a transfer bill. Money is transferred all over the lot. and the transfers are made under the cloak and protection of waivers of points of order.

I think it is true. as the gentleman from Iowa has just pointed out. that there are some 109 instances in this bill in which one or two clauses in the House rules: namely. clauses 2 and 5 of rule XXI would be violated if this rule had not specifically waived points of order in each of those instances. I can give the gentleman from Iowa the explanation that was presented in the Committee on Rules by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations as to why this request was made. The gentleman explained that it is not unusual for a supplemental bill. particularly one that reaches the floor shortly before the conclusion of a fiscal yearand we are. of course. less than 2 months from the conclusion of the current fiscal yearto require appropriations either where there is no authorization or to require appropriations in excess of authorized ceilings. So we do have a situation in which we have unexpended balances in one account and deficiencies in another. Therefore. it was the argument of the Committee on Appropriations that it did make very good fiscal sense to permit the transfer of funds from one account to another to make up these deficiencies rather than simply appropriating new moneys. Many of the deficiencies in this bill. as I understand it. are due to unbudgeted pay raises which have since taken effect. One other example that we were furnished is the general provision section of the Department of Defense supplemental in which there is an excess in the procurement account and deficiencies in personnel and operation and maintenance accounts due to the devaluation of currency. increased food prices. and increased activities in Southeast Asia above the levels that had originally been programed. Those are the reasons. in short. why those of us on the Committee on Rules were inclined to go along and grant the request of the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations for the waiver.",

    "speech": "As the gentleman from Iowa knows. we raise the pay of civilian and military personnel usually at least once a year. and that calls for additional funds over the original budget. So in prior years. without exception. insofar as I can remember. we have had to provide in the supplemental bill the additional funds for the pay raises which were mandated by law. We try to squeeze the money already available. In other words. we try to get the agencies to absorb as much of the cost of the pay raise from the appropriation previously made. instead of providing additional new funds to pay these increased costs mandated by Congress. In some instances we can transfer available funds between appropriations and thereby hold a tighter rein on the purse strings. We have some 80 instances in this bill where we have made transfers of available funds. This is the way we did it last year. and the year before. and the year before that. It seems to me to be the most prudent way to do it. It is better than to appropriate new money. increase the budget. increase the deficit. and subject ourselves to criticism for failure to adequately control the purse strings. I think the gentleman from Iowa will be one of the first to agree that this transferral of funds procedure is desirable under the circumstances. and I think the gentleman would agree that it is rather strange that the rules of the House would deny the committee authority to transfer these funds. I think it might be recited that in prior years. quite a number of years ago. it was in order. It was not held to be in violation of the Rules of the House for the Committee on Appropriations to bring in a bill transferring funds which had previously been approved by Congress.

These senior citizens are trying to live their golden years in dignity and security in the midst of a strongly and persistently inflationary economy. It is deplorable that the elderly who have contributed so much to our society. are depriving themselves of critically needed dollars because they cannot easily penetrate the complexities of the Internal Revenue Code. An inspection of our tax laws will reveal the existence of a number of special provisions designed to ease the tax burden on those over 65. Deductions and credits for retirement income. medical expenses. interest. charitable contributions. and taxes are some of these items. The sad fact is that these deductions are not widely recognized by our elderly. This is even more alarming when we realize the large numbers of senior citizens who overpay their income taxes. Onefifth of the population of this country is over 65. and as many as half these people may be overpaying their income taxes. I am therefore pleased to see the development of a checklist which has been prepared to help alleviate these problems.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we are living in an era when one of the most repressive countries in the world. the Soviet Union. has within it some of the bravest dissenters. The names of Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov to cite just two. will be recalled as giants of this era long after we have died. There is nothing more important than personal liberty and few have the courage to stand against the oppressive forces that exist everywhere including our own country. The difference however between the United States and the U.S.S.R. is that our system of government. with all of its faults. contains protections which ultimately permit the public to stop the attacks upon their liberties. Unfortunately that is not true in the Soviet Union where the government is dictatorial and Its oppression cannot be fought in the electoral process or the courts. It is remarkable that even without those protections. men. and women of courage will still stand and resist oppression with the knowledge that this may mean exile. imprisonment in a penal institution or mental institution. or death. What is particularly striking today is that Dr. Andrela Sakharov. himself in great danger because of his dissent. has asked the world for help to save the life of Leonid Plyusch who is now incarcerated in Dnepropetrovsk Psychiatric Hospital in the southeastern Ukraine. The appeal of Dr. Sakharov was sent to the International League for the Rights of Man for transmittal to Secretary General Waldheim. Leonid Plyusch. a mathematician. had been a research officer at the Institute of Cybernetics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kiev until he was dismissed In 1968 for dissident activities. One of fifteen who joined in 1969 to form the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights. he was arrested in January 1972. While the Soviet Union cannot be moved by internal legal safeguards for the protection of the individual. it has been established that it will move in response to world public opinion. Everyone who believes in personal liberty and wishes to honor Andrela Sakharov and to save Leonid Plyusch should write to Secretary Brezhnev in Moscow urging the release of Leonid Plyusch.",

Jewry had been scattered throughout history. but the community of nations had laid the foundations for a national home for Jews. The Soviet Union had lent its approval to this and should now cooperate in its implementation. Large numbers of Jews had emigrated in the last few years. but this change of attitude on the part of the Soviet authorities was not a matter of course. However. it was important to stress that the number of Jews who wished to emigrate was far greater than the number of those who had received permission to do so. He appealed to the USSR to show generosity in line with their world position. It was ridiculous to assume that this could harm their interests: on the contrary. in most countries this would be taken as proof of their readiness to help the process of d6tente. It was a moral obligation. Only 120 out of the 82.000 Jews emigrating in the last 2 years wished to go back to the USSR.

I believe we were all impressed by what he told us in his speech and by the warm feeling for fellow human beings. which was the underlying theme of what he said. When dealing with the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union. the question of humanity and the rights of man is. of course. the most important part of the topic. But it would be wrong to close ones eyes to the fact that the question also has a broader significance. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is mentioned in the draft recommendation and was also just now mentioned by Miss Bergergren. I assume we all remember that for many years it was the Soviet Union which asked for such a conference to be held. The nations of the West on their side were rather hesitant. The reason was not that the people. the politicians and the governments in the West were less interested in peace and ddtente than their counterparts in the East. To put it frankly. the reason was that we did not trust the Soviet Union. In the end the conference was convened. but still it is so that the result of all the discussions and negotiations in Helsinki. Geneva and Vienna will depend not so much on what is put into documents or treaties and that the decisive thing will be f the parties are able to trust each other. This Is one reason why I think each government and we the Council of Europe should ask the Soviet Union how they can expect that we shall believe that they will respect the rights of our people when they show such little respect for some of their own citizens. We should say. how can we believe in the peaceful coexistence at home with a group of people who in no way threaten your society or your political system. but who only ask you to exercise the principles of the Human Rights Declaration? I think we should make it quite clear to the Soviet Union that we will judge their intentions not least by what in the months to come will be their policy concerning the question we are discussing today.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the detestable abduction of Patricia Hearst on the night of February 4. 1974. has produced the first American instance of a crime that has been increasing in other parts of the world dning recent yearsa political kidnaping. As we are now fully aware. members of an organization called the Symbionese Liberation Army forcibly entered the apartment (f Miss Hearst. beat up her fiance and escaped to a hideout with the 19yearold granddaughter of the late publishing czar. William Randolph Hearst. as a hostage. After a lengthy silence. the abductors notified Patricias parents. Mr. and Mrs. Randolph A. Hearst. that before any negotiations on the release of their daughter could be conducted. the Hearst family would have to finance the distribution of $70 worth of food to every needy family in the State of California. a sum estimated to be in the neighborhood of $300 million. The only previous indication of the existence of the Symbionese group had taken place in November 1973. with the slaying of the highly regarded superintendent of the Oakland. Calif.. public schoolsMarcus Foster. a black educatorand the serious wounding of Fosters deputy Robert Blackburn in a parking lot. As a result of the Foster assassination. two members of the Symbionese Liberation ArmySLAare presently in San Quentin Prison awaiting trial for murder. They are Russell J. Little. 24also known as Robert J. Scalise and George Devotoand Joseph M. Remiro. 27. Still another SLA member. Nancy Ling Perry. 26--also known as Nancy Devoto and Lynn Ledworthis a fugitive. wanted on an arson charge following a fire that was set to destroy evidence in a house used by the SLA terrorists as headquarvers. arsenal. and bomb factory. In the hope that we could be helpful in the intensive but very sensitive investigation of the Hearst kidnaping. I immediately directed the staff of the House Committee on Internal Security to gather all information available from our files without delay and turn it over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This was done on the morning of February 8. 1974. and FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley has gratefully acknowledged the committees help and cooperation in the following letter of appreciation:",

Mr. Chairman. we are talking. as our colleague just finished saying. about small business. We are talking about the little fellows who have maybe 2. 3. 4 or 5 or as many as 10 or 15 or 20 employees. It was heartrending for me to see some small businesses closed up which I observed during the period from January 1. 1974. until January 21 when we returned to open the session. I visited one small business they had just threatened to put out of business. Well. with this kind of amendment the businessman can ask what it is they may have to do in order to comply with the requirements in order that they will not be closed up. I went to one place of business and there observed all of the guardrails and heavy screens that they had put around a piece of heavy machinery. Nobody could have possibly come close enough to that piece of machinery to be hurt even if he had tried. It was simply ridiculous for OSHA inspectors to say this piece of machinery had to be scrapped because I saw with my own eyesthere was simply no way for an operator to be hurt. This sort of an amendment makes sense. It makes sense for small business. All of the Members supported OSHA but we are for OSHA for big industry. We are all aware of accidents where employees have fallen into molten metal vats. never to be recovered. or terrible injuries where they are chewed up by assembly lines. I had in mind accidents such as these in big industryand also the mining industry. Here we are talking about small businesses. That is what this is all about.

At this point I insert in the RECORD the background statement of SACIA in support of their recommendation and. by extension. the amendment before us: Considerably greater training. education. and assistance is required if OSHAs goal of creating a safer work environment is to be achieved in a smooth. orderly. and reasonably economic manner. The scope. depth. and complexity of OSHA requirements make them difficult if not impossible to interpret and implement without such guidance. It is imperative that OSHA involvement with organizations seeking to conform their operations to its requirements be broadened beyond the current. essentially punitive approach. Many companies proceeding in good faith to upgrade their operations are doing so with little or no assurance that the steps they are taking are necessary. desirable. or will. in fact. lead to compliance. This problem exists for large as well as small companies. and it is important that they be able to avail themselves of sound OSHA guidance to ensure that the steps they contemplate are appropriate. since in many cases the expenditures required are considerable. It had proposed that the present inspection system be continued but that. independently. a mechanism be created through which companies can seek and obtain guidance. including onsite inspection and consultation. that will enable them to move forward with safety measures with certitude that these measures will be productive. This will maximize the benefits to be derived from the safetyrelated expenditures being made and. at the same time. will have longterm beneficial effects as an educational program that will upgrade the professionalism of safety personnel and speed full compliance with OSHA regulations.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to support the amendment that will provide for consultative inspections. onsite consultation for businesses seeking compliance with the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Without attorneys on retainer. safety professionals. or industrial hygienists on their staffs. many employers. small businessmen in particular. have had great difficulty in complying with the often complex and highly technical health. safety standards. despite their desire and intent to do so. The goals of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. a safe and healthy working place for every American worker. are universally accepted. What I found objected to in the many letters I receive is the administration of the act. Often businessmen have questions about the regulations. they are confused as to whether they are violating the act. uncertain as to the meaning of the new rules. Yet. if they invite an OSHA inspector to visit they are liable to be found in noncompliance and fined. Thus there is no way. short of hiring expensive technical assistance. which many cannot afford. that the small business can readily and rapidly bring itself into compliance. Accordingly some have protested the law itself. However. the general consensus today is that OSHA is working. Not as it should. but the idea has gained acceptance. The National Small Business Association wrote the chairman of the Select Small Business Subcommittee indicating their support for the amendment that we are considering today. This amendment would provide funding through the Department of Labor by means and grants to the States for the purpose of establishing onsite consultative services. I believe this amendment has broad support. The National Small Business Association in indicating their support for this amendment made clear their commitment to the idea of assistance in carrying out the law versus legislation to exempt businesses from it.",

It is good because it recognizes the problem but. in my opinion. it does not solve the problem. It recognizes the problem because under present circumstances and in most States of the Union a business firm cannot be entered by an inspector from OSHA for the first time without facing the likelihood of a citation for violations. There are only about 20 of the States of the Union which are under State agency enforcement of OSHA. As I understand the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin. it would only go to States where the State agency is the enforcement agency. not to the other States where Federal enforcement is the rule. The basic flaw lies in the Federal law which was passed in 1970 which denies the privilege of any Federal inspector under OSHA entering into premises first for the benefit of advice and counsel only. He simply cannot legally enter into these premises except to enforce the law. I submit that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin . while a good amendment. does not correct that basic problem. Mr. Chairman.

Every day I get correspondence. every day I get phone calls. and I know that every single Member in this room Is going through the same thing. And yet we fail to react. I know a man in Dickson. Tenn.. he has a foundry. he is charged with two minor violations. and the fine is $130. There are two pieces of equipment he has to replace as a result of that. and they cost over $500.000. He is not going to pay for it. He says. \"I am passing that on to the consumer.\" This is inflation. Yet we sit here and demagog about licking inflation. We say. \"Look at the administration.\" It is weCongresswho are causing it. Mr. Chairman. it is time we go to work and show the small businessman that we care. and that we are going to work for him. This may not be a perfect amendment. There may be problems with it. but. for crying out loud. the bill is not perfect. either. We must move. We must show some support for the businessman In this legislation.",

It was a deep shock to all of us to hear of his tragic passing. I have listened to the statements made by many. of the employees around the Capitol about how sorrowful they felt on learning of his passing. . BILL MILLS was a dedicated public servant. He was a hard worker and. as the Speaker has pointed out. very attentive to his duties. He had a fine war record. serving with the famed 3d Army Division under General Patton. and he served his nation well and his beloved country. representing his Eastern Shore district. He loved his work here in the Capitol. I knew him first when he was working as the administrative assistant for former Congressman Rogers Morton. BILL carried on his work there very well. We are all going to miss BILL MILLS because he was a kindly man and a good family man.

I cannot help but note the air of sadness in the Chamber this evening insofar as the eulogies for BILL MILLS are concerned. It seems so sad we have to wait until a time such as this to suddenly realize the loss we have all suffered. I have known BILL MILLS for a number of years. long before I came to this Chamber. BILL MILLS. although he was a gentleman from the Eastern Shore. was a rare combination of sportsman and family man and businessman and a courageous individual. I enjoyed my acquaintanceship with him over the years. Rogers Morton and his administrative aide used to talk to me and then when he came to the House. Mr. MILLS made a contribution most rare in these days because he was knowledgeable. He very rarely exercised any animosity for anyone as an individual. The thing that really disturbs me is the underlying reason for our loss of BILL MILLS. It would seem ironic that this situation should develop for a man like BILL MILLS in the prime of life and a very capable leader. one who has been known to all of his colleagues as a man of integrity and outstanding courage. a churchman and a family man.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it has now been 2 years since the introduction of wage and price controls with the freeze of August 15. 1971. The economic record since that date shows that controls have failed against inflation and have caused damage to the economy. I am therefore today reintroducing legislation to repeal the Economic Stabilization Act which gives the President power to impose wage and price controls. Various types of control programs have been tried since August of 1971. The evidence strongly suggests that none of these \"phases\" have been effective. In the 2year period of controls. consumer prices have risen 8.4 percent and food prices 16.5 percent. By comparison. in 1971. prior to controls. the Consumer Price Index was rising at a rate of 3.8 percent while food prices were rising at a rate of 5 percent. No one knows what inflation would have been without controls. but the inflation rates which have prevailed since August 15. 1971. have been greater than the trend of inflation occurring prior to controls. The problem in using wage and price freezes to fight inflation occurs because of what is termed \"postfreeze bulge.\" This term refers to the fact that prices generally rise sharply immediately after a freeze is lifted because of pentup pressures. Rises in food prices following the lifting of ceilings on July 18 are a dramatic example of \"postfreeze bulge.\" The recent beef shortage provides an excellent example of how wage and price controls can harm the economy. Meat processors could not buy cattle at prices that made it profitable to sell at the ceiling prices for beef. As a result. there was a beef shortage until the administration made it clear that the ceiling price on beef would be removed. On August 1. 1973. I urged the President to terminate the beef price ceiling immediately. Because of the beef shortage. prices on beef substitutes such as poultry. pork. fish. and eggs rose higher than they would have otherwise because of increased demand for these products. Many other products besides meat are in short supply because of the recent price",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I applaud the decisions handed down by the Supreme Court yesterday regarding obscenity. Once more the people of this Nation are afforded some legal protections against the barrage of filth produced for exploitative purposes. Once more the States and communities can crack down on pornographers without fear that their efforts will be overturned by a higher court. Under the old standard of judgmentwhether pornographic material was \"utterly without redeeming social value\"we have seen our communities faced with an influx of these materials. helpless under a vague first amendment interpretation by the courts. I do not believe that the writers of the Constitution ever meant the protection of free speech to go to this extent. and I am sure that they would not have wanted the express will of the States and cities to be thwarted in the process. The Court has now agreed with this position. Chief Justice Burger has observed that prior interpretations demeaned the first amendment by equating \"the free and robust exchange of ideas and political debate with commercial exploitation of obscene material.\" In place of the old broad guideline. almost impossible for a prosecutor to prove. the Court has established three new standards. If a pornographic work \"taken as a whole. does not have serious literary. artistic. political. or scientific value.\" and \"taken as a whole. appeals to the prurient interest in sex\" and is \"patently offensive\" in its content. it can be banned and purveyors prosecuted. Even more important for the people of this great Nation. their own judgment on the nature of pornographic materials is now to be taken directly into account. The Court has held that \"community standards\" of decency may be those of a local area. rather than a nationwide standard. The States can thus establish their own standards or can permit local options. Chief Justice Burger noted that the questions of offensiveness and appeal to prurient interest are \"essentially questions of fact\" which local Judges and juries can decide. Mr. Speaker. I am overjoyed at this new set of standards. and at the decision to rely on the good taste of the American people. For too long. the Constitution has been used to protect the rights of the few at the expense of the majority. We are now headed back in the right direction with this decision to protect the public dignity against the assaults of bad taste.",

Last December I visited the Philippines and spent several days in the deep rural areas where the vast majority. 70 percent in fact. of the Philippine population still lives. There I spoke with a number of tenant farmers as well as with government officials. landowners. and others affected by the land situation. The deep grievances of impoverished. landless farmers have again and again threatened disruption and disintegration of Philippine society in the generation since independence. Furthermore. these grievances are not only dangerous. they are a dead weight against agricultural production and overall economic development. The problems of rural developmentthe threats of large scale violence. the lack of development. and the low agricultural productivity. which by the way drives up prices here by creating demands on our own disappearing surplusesare many and complex. Because of my concern with these problems. I was very pleased to see in the New York Times for Sunday. June 10. an extensive section. paid for by the Philippine Government. presenting that governments plans and policies for the \"New Society.\" The presentation highlighted and emphasized the absolute determination of the Philippine Government to proceed with a very large scale land reform program which would provide land for at least twothirds of the tenant farmers. The presentation contains one of the most candid recognitions of a major social problem that I have ever seen in a formal government statement. especially one directed largely to potential investors. It also embodies one of the most direct and public pledges for an effective solution to that problem. I believe that the Philippine Government should be praised for the highly public commitment to the vital land reform program.",

This is a bill similar to one which we enacted in 1970 for similar purposes. It is necessary because under the continuing resolution new scholarships and loans for freshmen students entering professional schools in September cannot be made. and without such new scholarships and loans both the schools and the students would be severely penalized.

All other aspects of the health manpower program have been taken care of by the recent continuing resolution or by HEW forward funding.

Although this measure does not deal directly with the matter of revising the existing health manpower programs. our committee is presently working on a new health manpower proposal which I hope will be an effective measure.

As the chairman of our committee pointed out when we passed this control substances bill. the most recent measure in the field. we forgot to take a look at the penalty provisions that had been in the previous law. So we found we had certain persons in the penitentiaries or in prisons under the old law and were held there under mandatory sentence. When we amended it. some of them became eligible for parole. but those convicted under prior law were not made so eligiblethe provisions of this bill correct that situation. I would like to make some comments about the noknock provisions repealed under the passage of this bill. we can recall we had noknock provisions on the floor when we dealt with District of Columbia laws. This bill repeals the noknock provisions of the Federal law. I am not so sure it is a wise move. for the reason that under the common law they can break and enter if a police officer so desires. if he feels sure some violation of Federal law is going on within a certain residence. Under the noknock legislation it was our intent to protect the public by requiring that law enforcement people get a warrant to enter and. therefore. would have to prove their case before entry was made. However. it must be said that many States have passed laws that have thrown out the common law entry and it has not been extensively used in the District of Columbia. So I have reconsidered the more rigid position I took earlier. I am advised that this does not affect the recodification of any of the laws and penalties provided in the laws of the District of Columbia. I am sure the chairman would agree with me. that was not our intent. So I support the bill. I hope it is passed. I believe it is good legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the House is today voting on the extension of the Controlled Substances Act and I would like to speak on behalf of a provision in the bill to repeal the noknock section of this act whereby Federal narcotics agents were authorized to obtain a warrant to enter a dwelling without knocking and identifying themselves. I introduced this amendment to repeal the noknock law in Committee and am firmly convinced that it should be supported. The noknock provision was enacted 4 years ago and during that time it has seldom been used by either the Federal agents or the D.C. police. Such action on the part of law enforcement drug agents is extremely dangerous to the agents as well as to the occupants of the dwelling which they are entering. Everyone in the country is aware of the raid which took place in Collinsville. Ill.. in April of 1973 when agents raided two homes and absolutely terrorized the occupants and then finally discovered that they were in the wrong house. Under the noknock provision. law enforcement ofcers are effectively entering a dwelling like any burglar and the occupants of the home have the right to use force to prevent such entry. Citizens have a right to protect themselves and can use a gun to shoot the agents and are perfectly within the law in doing so. I believe it is significant that Chief Jerry Wilson has stated that he has no objection to the repeal of this provision. His department has not used it since. October of 1971. Also. in 1972 there were 100 noknock warrants issued nationwide and in 1973. there was only one such warrant. In short. the noknock law simply does not work. and its elimination will in no way bring the drug program to a standstill. This country has always upheld the traditional right of personal privacy and the idea that a mans home is his castle. The provision should never have been enacted and the Congress In its wisdom should repeal it.",

I am calling up today an amendment to insure that existing Federal hydroelectric projects are expedited in order to make certain that this source of electric power is expanded as rapidly as is possible. As Members of the Senate know. I have worked diligently as a member of the Public Works Appropriations Subcommittee to insure the development of hydroelectric projects both in the Pacific Northwest and across the Nation. In the fiscal year 1974 budget I provided funds by amendments for the second powerhouse at Bonneville and for additional generating units at Little Goose and Lower Granite Dams. Funds for the latter two projects have not yet been obligated by this administration. These types of projects need to be expedited in light of the current energy crisis. I know that many projects throughout the Nation could and should be completed. I believe that Congress wants to know which of these projects could be put on an expedited completion schedule. My amendment simply directs the Federal Energy Administration to prepare a comprehensive list of such existing projects. My amendment also requires the Federal Energy Administration to prepare a list of projects where funds have been provided by Congress but have not been obligated by the administration. I believe we should know on which projects Congress has all ready acted but the administration has not obligated funds. Hopefully. my amendment will provide Congress with the information needed to insure that funds are provided on an expedited basis.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of the inequities in our utility regulatory system is the rate structure. Residential consumers often pay two or three times more for their electricity than do large industrial concerns. There are sound arguments for rate restructure. Industrial and large commercial users are primarily responsible .for increase in demand and. therefore. additional plant capacity. Their low rates discourage conservation. The social cost of electric power used by industry is extremely high when the industry is a major polluter. This important factor is. unfortunately. seldom considered in rate design. On the other hand. cost of service for basic electric needs to lowincome rate payers in denselysettled areas is often a fraction of the cost to the large industrial concerns which are subsidized by the lowincome residential users. Fortunately. several of the State public service .commissions are recognizing inequity and restructuring rates. One is the Michigan commission. whose chairman likened the typical rate structure to \"allowing a Cadillac owner to pay 26 cents for gasoline. while requiring a Volkswagen owner to pay 41 cents.\" Others are Wisconsin and North Carolina. Vermont and a number of other States efforts are under way to obtain. either by legislation or regulation. rate restructure which will provide 400 kilowatt hours of electricity per month for $10. or some similar small amount of electricity for a set payment. Millions of pensioners and other lowincome persons face a grim winter because of escalating fuel prices. Adoption of the Lifeline rate would be of great assistance to them. It might also provide an incentive. now lacking. for utilities to pay more attention to their fuel costs which they casually pass on via automatic adjustment clauses. The November 1 issue of the Northern Virginia Sun carried an excellent article. \"A Lifeline Plug.\" The October 11 issue of the Charlotte. N.C. Observer carried an account. by Jack Horan. of a decision by the North Carolina Utilities Commission which took a long step toward the Lifeline rate.

Marketing and Stabilization of Prices of the Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committee. These hearings reviewed the U.S. food situation and food aid demands. I would like to call your attention to the statement of Mr. Robert G. Lewis of the National Farmers Union which points out that our present agricultural policies are totally inadequate and are clearly set to encourage \"boom and bust. glut or famine.\" A special problem is the fact that the 1975 price supports have been set so low33 percent of parity for wheat and 40 percent of parity for feed grainsthat farmers will be unable to survive if crop production returns to normal during the coming year. As an example. if 78 million acreages of wheat are planted and yields per acre reach 33.9 bushels we will have a total harvest of almost 2.7 billion bushels. This level of production would likely lead to a glut on the market. Mr. Lewis correctly asks: Why does the U.S.A. undermine and handicap her preeminent food power? Why do we try to depress the prices and discourage the producers of our most effective asset in international trade. in world politics. even In national security? I think this statement makes a very convincing case as to why our agricultural policies are in need of revision. and I commend it to the attention of this body. Mr. President.

I would like to call to the attention of the Senate to a most unfortunate incident which occurred last year and to make my colleagues aware of the facts which have been uncovered during the course of an investigation into that incident. Col. Travis M. Gafford. a black. had been nominated for the post of Chief. Army Section. U.S. Military group. Chile. When Colonel Gafford failed to be appointed to this position. it was understood that his nomination had not been acceptable to the Government of Chile. probably as a result of his race. I wrote the Secretary of Defense expressing my extreme distress over this matter and my desire for a thorough investigation. Mr. Schlesinger has informed me that an investigation has been conducted. and I would be pleased to share the results with my colleagues. Colonel Gaffords nomination was withheld for a number of illadvised reasons. There was a general assumption that Chile would react unfavorably to the nomination of a black officer. In addition there was. apparently. an intention on the part of the Army to spare a black officer from a potentially antagonistic environment. The resultant situation. whatever the motives. can only be described as inexcusable. especially as it became clear during the course of the investigation that a staff recommendation favoring the nomination had been overlooked and that Colonel Gaffords own opinions and feelings on the matter were consulted only after the fact. At the same time it should be recognized that this most regrettable and unfortunate incident did not. apparently. result from overt or intentional prejudice directed against the colonel but. rather. was the product of a long series of individual misjudgments and misunderstandings inconsistent with the usually admirable performance of the Army. I have been informed that Colonel Gafford has subsequently been appointed as Division Chief of the International Staff Affairs Office of the Strategic and Security Assistance Directorate. It is perhaps small solace to the man that his misfortune has demonstrated to the Army the great need for safeguards to prevent the recurrence of similar. potentially tragic situations. I would like to express my gratitude to Secretary of Defense Schlesinger and to Army Secretary Callaway for their cooperation in making the facts known to all involved. Mr. President.

He has given outstanding leadership to many agricultural groups throughout his distinguished career and has been honored numerous times for his agricultural contributions.

This is a joint planning effort among the State agricultural experiment stations of our land grant universities. the colleges of 1890. the schools of forestry. extension service. and various agencies in the U.S. Department of Agriculture involved in agricultural and forestry research. In his presentation. Dr. Coker pointed out that the chronicle of agricultural development in South Carolina was representative of the agricultural history of most Southern States. He then proceeded to trace that fascinating history from the early days of rice and indigo. through the days of the War Between the States when cotton was king. to the ascendancy of the principal modernday agricultural crops in South Carolinasoybeans and tobacco. Dr. Coker emphasized the role of agricultural societies and the research and extension efforts of land grant colleges in making farming a highly scientific enterprise. He noted that \"brain power and intellectual life are working intensely on the land now. applying the laws of nature and economics\" to all phases of agricultural production and marketing. Mr. President. I think Dr. Cokers address is particularly appropriate with our Nations Bicentennial approaching.

    "speech": "Mr. President. there is at the desk a message from the House in the form of H.R. 17635a bill to adjust the support price for tobacco. It is a reasonable billguided through the House by two Kentucky Congressmen. Mr. STUBBLEFIELD and Mr. PERKINS. Two days of hearings before my subcommittee on agricultural marketing. production and stabilization of prices clearly demonstrates the need for this legislation. The present formula for determining the tobacco support price has proved to be inadequate in responding to the substantial increases in production costs over the past years and consequently has failed to provide growers with the protection intended by the program. H.R. 17635 would set the support price at 75 percent of parity. This would result in a modest increasestill substantially below the current and projected market price. So it is not expected that the new support price could result in theGovernment acquiring any appreciable amount of tobacco. But it would provide the growerwho is typically a small farmer greatly dependent on tobacco income to sustain his operationwith a reasonable amount of insurance that his investment and labor will not result in great financial loss. It will also strengthen his position in negotiating bank loans necessary to finance his total farming activity. As for the amount of tobacco the Government might acquire under the support program. it should be pointed out that during the past several years. such stocks have been disposed of at a profit and at present there is practically no tobacco in the Government pool. I believe H.R. 17635 should be passed. But I realize that during these final hours of the 93d Congress action could only be accomplished through a unanimous consent agreement. Several Senators have indicated their intention to object to any such agreement. I regret that this is the case because there is every indication that a majority of this body would agree to this measure if a vote could be taken.

The campaign has been even more intense in subsidiaries service areas. which run from the shores of Lake Michigan to Virginias Roanoke Valley.

American Electric Power. and the other electric utilities will realize that the best way to improve their public image is not to use a slick advertising campaign. but to devote their time and money to providing the public cheaper. more efficient. pollutionfree electricity. It should be noted that last year the American Electric Power system established a record.

Looking at the Federal funds deficit we anticipate.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the urgency of the question concerning a comprehensive test ban treatyCTBTwas accentuated by the recent nuclear explosion by India. A CTBT would end a major phase of the qualitative development of nuclear arms. Perhaps even more significant would be the effects of a CTBT in reducing international tension and increasing the chances of worldwide acceptance of the Nonproliferation Treaty. There is a critical dependence of the development of new nuclear weapons on continued testing. A ban on such testing would inhibit qualitative improvements in nuclear weapons systems that are beyond the calculated margin of safety. A CTBT would help stabilize the nuclear arms race and encourage further agreement on other qualitative and quantitative arms control measures. Many countries have not signed the Nonproliferation Treaty that was established in 1970. The reason given by the nonsignatory countries vary. but some are directly linked to the failure of the United States and U.S.S.R. to achieve a CTBT. For instance. in 1965 India said that it would not sign the Nonproliferation Treaty until there was tangible progress toward disarmament. including a CTBT. Depending on the number of participating countries. a CTBT would limit the adverse environmental effects of nuclear testing. Such a treaty could also result in significant longterm savings in nuclear defense expenditures. The continuing proliferation of nuclear weapons is a serious threat to international security. I believe a CTBT would be a crucial turning point in the procurement of world peace. I am entering into the RECORD an article by Senator EDWARD KENNEDY. discussing the merits of a comprehensive test ban as opposed to a threshold test ban.

During the current fiscal year. $100.000.000 is required to implement Public Law 93295 that became effective May 1. 1974. It provides a 15- to 18percent increase in disability compensation benefits for serviceconnected disabled veterans. a 15percent increase in allowances for dependents of veterans who are 50 percent or more disabled. a 17percent increase for dependency and indemnity compensation for widows and children. and a 17percent increase in aid and attendance allowances. This new legislation passed by our Committee on Veterans Affairs earlier this year will benefit some 2.2 million veterans receiving compensation benefits and approximately 375.000 widows. children and parent cases receiving death compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation benefits in fiscal year 1974. Approximately $77.000.000 is needed by the Veterans Administration to implement Public Law 93293 that became effective May 31. 1974. You will recall we recently passed a 30day emergeficy extension of the time during which veterans must complete their training under the GI bill.

Laos is indeed our friend and deserves better treatment from the Congress of the United States than some. of those remarks seem to indicate. It was said a bit earlier in the debate that Gen. Vang Pao was engaged in hostilities in Laos. Of course. he was defending his country from the Communist insurgency. What was not said was. that those hostilities were precipitated by the Pathet Lao. the Communist rebels of Laos. a revolution supported and exported by the North Vietnamese. Gen. Vang Pao and the Meo tribesmen. whom I met on my trip to Laos in 1971. have attempted to protect their own country from the same type of Communist insurgency being carried on in other Southeast Asian countries through the support of Hanoi. It seems to me rather than chastising Gen. Vang Pao. he should be applauded for his contributions to the cause of free Laos which shows that he is on the side of freedom. not totalitarianism and that he hardly deserves the type of remarks that have been made in the Chamber here today. These people have bravely defended their peaceful country for years against the Communists who used their children for carrying North Vietnamese supplies down the Ho Chi Minh trail.

I have met Gen. Vang Pao in the presence of the Ambassador and consider the general to be an excellent citizen in every way. Gen. Vang Paos long years of determined and often successful struggle against some of the best regiments of the North Vietnamese Army are well known. His combat against communism and the Communists in northern Laos began from the early age of 13 years. and endured through decades of warfare. Since 1960. at a crucial point in the U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia. he has assisted in the pursuance of U.S. Southeast Asian policy. Military analysts recognize that Vang Paos skillful organization and tactical use of the Meo irregulars forced the North Vietnamese to assign most of two infantry divisions to North Laosunits which would otherwise have been free to oppose American soldiers in South Vietnam. He also developed a searchandrescue capability in northern Laos which resulted in the successful pickup of numerous American airmen downed behind enemy lines. Vang Chong has exemplified his fathers traits during his years at the Staunton Military Academy. Staunton. Va.. where he has been for the past 4 years. He is a cadet captain. a member of the honor society. and is also the S2 officer of the corps of cadets. His grades are generally high and he has the enthusiastic respect of his Instructors.

The Government spent $123.193 for various security matters and work on the residence of the Vice President in Minnesota and his apartment here. These are all involved in the area of security. In the Agnew administration there was $175.000 spent by the GSA for renovation and other things connected in some way with the installation of security measures. The GSA spent $175.000 and the Sacret Service spent $70.000. so there is a total of $245.000 in the Agnew administration.

Even though I voted against it and I do oppose the program. it takes a great deal of skill to move any legislation through a committee of 40 complex individuals. every one of them presuming he is as great a statesman as the Secretary of State. Dr. MORGAN does a great. diplomatic job in keeping the committee functioning. Actually. Mr. Chairman. I would like to point out that there are major inconsistencies in this bill- I hope we can clean it up as we go through the amendment stage. but I think the most important inconsistencies are the ones a few of us referred to in producing the minority views. I would recommend to the Members that they take a look at those views. The Foreign Aid Administration having reached a low ebb. it is that time in its history when a new title is slapped onto an old program. That is one of the basic defects of this bill. It is changed. supposedly. by an adjustment of terminology. but does not cure the administrative difficulties that are inherent in the program.",

Indeed. the way SBA has been operating in the past few yearsunfortunately with acquiescence of the Congresshas given serious reason to wonder why It should be continued at all. Only a meager amount of money has been utilized for direct loan purposesalmost all SBA help has been on a participatory basis. yielding up the hapless businessman into the clutches of the usurerand thereby vitiating the principal reason or cause for the very existence of SBA.

He has taken this subcommittee through some very difficult hearings relating to the Small Business Administration. During these hearings Mr. STEPHENS has been very fair and complete in the way that he has made sure that the small business people of this country who depend on the SBA have been adequately protected. The gentleman from Georgia has made sure that we have had total and complete hearings on the charges and countercharges that were made relating to the Small Business Administration. Because of these hearings ft was necessary to withhold this legislation from passage until many of the complaints and charges were cleaned up. During all of this time the gentleman from Georgia was extremely fair. and made sure that the committee had all the facts. The Administrator. Mr. Kleppe was given adequate time to respond to the many charges that were made by both employees of the Small Business Administration and by outsiders. Through all of this the gentleman from Georgia has maintained a sense of balance. and a sense of fairness and decency that we do not always find when It is politically popular to jump on troubled agencies. So I think that the Members of the House should know that. without any doubt. the gentleman from Georgia has consistently worked to make sure that we did not just rush ahead with this legislation to increase the ceiling. without first making sure that the SBA house was in order. and. that the improper practices found in the hearings were curbed and stopped.

The credit crunch in the form of tight money and high interest rates. the necessity to conlorm wlth Federal.

It is a good bill and its provisions have been carefully worked out to provide maximum benefit to the Nations hardpressed small businesses. The amendments. if enacted. will permit the Small Business Administration to increase its overall assistance to small firms. Prompt enactment will permit SBA to operate its financial programs at full capacity and remove the restraint under which the agency now is operating in order to comply with a legal ceiling on the total amount of loans the SBA may have outstanding at any one time. H.R. 15578 also contains provisions to alleviate the problems created for small businesses by the energy crisis as well as other beneficial amendments. Madam Chairman. the SBA has. in each of the past 3 years. provided record levels of assistance to small business in all of its major programsmanagement help. procurement as well as financial assistance. The SBA has created a spirit of cooperation and partnership with the private sector that is gaining momentum each year and providing the basis for the increased levels of assistance to small business. Prompt and affirmative action by the House on H.R. 15578 will help SBA maintain that momentum as well as strengthen the confidence of the private sector in SBA and small business which is so vital to the preservation of our free enterprise system.",

We believed there were not adequate protections in that legislation. The subcommittee has worked long and hard. and as others have pointed out. held investigations which brought forth facts which made us certain that all was not right with respect to the administration of the SBA. That is a continuing situation that the committee is addressing itself to. We have put into this bill a provision that the GAO will have an audit of SBA activities and that the Initial audit will be made available to the committee within six months from the enactment of the bill. I know. having participated in the investigation of the SBA. that much has to be done with respect to the way SBA programs are administered. I also want to make the point that I am not happy with the nature of the kinds of loans that are being made. the amounts of those loans. the $350.000 loans. I am not happy with the fact that concerns that do business in the millions are receiving loans. I believe that SBA was intended for the mama and papa type of establishment.

I am pleased with the action that the House is taking today on the Small Business Act Amendments . in particular the amendment to provide longterm. lowinterest loans to small businessmen affected by the energy crisis. I had initially cosponsored this proposal with Mr. FRASER and others. The proposal will allow the Small Business Administration to make or refinance loans to companies which are directly and seriously affected by the fuel shortage. The repayment period for the loans will be up to 30 years. Interest rates will be based on a formula used by the SBA in calculating the repayment terms for natural disaster loans. This legislation is needed because of the uncertainties small businesses have faced in the past years with the varying administration of wageprice controls and. now. the shortage of energy. The legislation amends the section on natural disasters which is appropriate because the severe ramifications of the fuel shortage could not be predicted by the small concerns and is. thus. as similarly disastrous as a flood or an earthquake. We cannot afford to lose any more of the independent. owneroperated businesses. They provide an element of competition in an economy dominated by large firms. They provide jobs for millions of people. Congress must take this action so that these companies can continue to provide much needed goods and services. By providing easier access to credit and better payment terms we should be able to aid small tourist concerns. correlated businesses. and others who are dependent on easy availability of fueleither as a raw material or as a factor needed for demand.

I would like to report to my colleagues today some recent events relating to implementation of the Indian Education Act passed by Congress last year as title IV to Public Law 92318. Last fall I letter I sent to thenCommissioner of Education Sidney Marland (118 Cong. Rec. p. 26990. Aug. 7. 1972). in which I indicated the need and congressional desires for full implementation of the act during the second half of fiscal year 1973. If there is a determination and commitment on the part of the Office of Educationcommensurate with that of the congressional supporters of this legislationto see it implemented as rapidly as possible. I feel that applications could be received and funds delivered before the end of 1972. The Senate Committee on Appropriations included funds for implementation of the act during the second half of the fiscal year. and specified in its Report (S. Rept. 921297. page 25) : The Committee allowance for the Indian Education Act .is intended to provide funds sufficient only for the second half of this fiscal year to get these new programs started. It is expected that the Office of Education will act expeditiously in this regard. As passed and signed into law on October 31. 1972. the Appropriations Act contained $18 million for implementation of the Indian Education Act. Yet the Office of Education failed to respond to these congressional mandates. Throughout the fall and winter no regulations were proposed. The names of nominees to the National Advisory Council were held up by the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare. Proposals for funding under the act were returned. And a request that Congress rescind the funds appropriated was included in the Presidents budget message. On February 28. 1973. I wrote the Acting Commissioner of Education with specific questions relating to OE Indian education programs and to the administrations rescission request. Although my staff has inquired into the status of the reply to my letter. I am sorry to say that as of this date--over 2 months laterI have received no reply to this letter.

The next day a large contingent of Indian educators and spokesmen met with HEW Secretary Weinberger and were assured that HEW was going to send the list of National Council nominees to the White House. The Secretary also indicated that if Congress did not rescind the Indian education appropriations. HEW would move toward implementation of the act. Congress. of course. has not acted on this rescission. Since the Indian Education Act mandates action by the Commissioner of Education and the Presidentaction which they have not yet takenpotential beneficiaries under the act have brought their complaints to the Federal courts. On January 31 of this year the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and other tribes and Indian organizations joined to bring suit against HEW and OMB officials. and the President. to require implementation of the act. The Department of Justice. defending the action. moved immediately for dismissal of the complaint as to the President. arguing that the claim against the President for nonappointment of the National Advisory Council is barred by the separation of powers doctrine. After considering the elements of the Governments argument. Judge June Green. on April 25. denied the Governments motion for dismissal of the case as to the President.

Mr. President. despite what I observed in an earlier statement to be the administrations negative. even hostile. attitude toward taking substantial steps to improve the quality of Indian education. it now appears that pressures from Congress and the continuing interest and supportive activity from the Indian community have brought about a reversal in attitude on the part of government officials.

I might add that if the 15th of this month passes without appointment of the National Council. I will make every effort to have my resolution passed by Congress before the months end. Certainly Congress and American Indians are justified in running out of patience.

I want to echo most of the thoughts that the chairman has stated. because during the course of the hearings it became very obvious that we were subject to a great deal of rhetoric. As the chairman well knows. and as I put in my separate views which are filed in the report. we find that those from the Office of Telecommunications testified before the committee that they really did not want what is commonly referred to as a fourth network. which is the interconnect and yet they were not willing to have a 2year appropriation so that localism could be established. As the chairman pointed out \"Sesame Street\" took 36 months to establish all the groundwork and research for the development of that program. It is estimated that of all the major series on television today the shortest period of time it takes to do the groundwork. to develop research and study. is a minimum of 18 months. What we are really seeing is an approach by those who wish to limit the appr3priation to 1 year. saying we should have more localism and more creativity at the local station level. and that the interconnect should not become a fourth network. and it should not. Yet can we appropriate on a 1year level? We could do no more than to make it an interconnect. When the Senator from Rhode Island said that Mr. Loomis had said they did not want the nose of Congress in this. that is what Congress said when they established this in the first place. It was not that the president of the corporation said this. He was doing no more than echoing the debate when this was established in the first place. What do we see?

If they did not have the interconnect. some of them estimate. their network would be closed as much as 50 percent of the time. Mr. President. if you are going to ask these stations to make this kind of investment. if you are going to ask them to establish localism. the only thing I can say is we have to either have an appropriation for more than 1 year or it will never happen. We find by reason of this process the situation of a destroyer going through a mine field. On the one hand we hear Clay Whitehead say we need more localism. we cannot have another network. and yet we see them saying we should appropriate for only 1 year. If we appropriate for only 1 year the interconnect will be a network of necessity. I hope this amendment does not succeed because if it does we should have hearings. not on whether we are going to appropriate for 1 year or 2 years. but whether we are going to repeal the act in its entirety.",

I am today introducing a bill. at the request of the Department of Justice. to raise the pay levels of the U.S. attorneys for the Central Division of Californiawhich includes Los Angelesand the Northern District of Illinoiswhich includes Chicago. Both of these positions are now at a level V in the Executive Schedule. This bill would place these positions at level IV. the level now applicable to the U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York and the District of Columbia. The workloads of the four U.S. attorneys offices is comparable. and the pay level applicable to them should also be comparable. In fiscal 1973. there were 3.766 cases filed in the Central District of California. 2.216 in the Northern District of California. and 2.612 in the Southern District of New York. Attorneys in the U.S. attorneys office in the Central District of California spent 17.536 manhours in court. while attorneys in the U.S. attorneys office in the Northern District of Illinois spent 16.742 manhours in court and those in the Southern District of New York spent 19.565 hours in court. Statistics from the District of Columbia cannot usefully be compared to those for other districts because of the role which the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia plays as local district attorney as well as U.S. attorney. Because the Central District of California and the Northern District of Illinois consist of two of the great metropolitan centers of the United States. the workload of the U.S. attorneys offices is not only heavy but also often involves extremely complex cases. The facts indicate that both the size of the workload and the complexity of the cases handled by the two U.S. Attorneys offices is comparable to those of the offices of the two U.S. attorneys to whom level IV of the Executive Schedule now applies. Accordingly. I introduce this bill to provide a vehicle for congressional discussion and consideration of the equalization of the pay levels applicable to these U.S. Attorneys. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today introducing legislation to amend the tariff schedules to suspend the current duty on feathers and downs. The purpose of this legislation is to suspend to zero the duty on feathers and downs used primarily in the manufacture of finished products. such as sleeping bags. parkas. and ski jackets. About 72 percent of the U.S. demand for feathers and downs is met by imports. The traditional principle in establishing tariff schedules has been to assess a higher rate of duty on finished articles than on the raw materials used in their production. Under the current tariff schedules. however. imported feathers and downs are subject to a 15 percent ad valorem rate duty. while finished goods made. primarily of feathers are subject to only a 7percent rate of duty. This 8percent difference has created a tariff disparity which has made foreign production of articles like sleeping bags and parkas more competitive in the U.S. market. As a result. foreign imports of these finished articles have increased their share of the U.S. market from 2 percent in 1970 to 18 percent in 1973. Eliminating this anomaly will permit our domestic industry to compete more fairly and effectively with imports that are currently subject to a duty rate that is less than half the rate domestic users must pay on crude feathers and downs. In commenting on this legislation. the relevant executive agencies unanimously agreed that there was sufficient economic justification to remove the duty on crude feathers and downs at this time. The Special Trade Representatives endorsement of this bill pointed out that it would in no way jeopardize any U.S. negotiating position in the upcoming trade talks since the proposed legislation would preserve U.S. bargaining power on this particular tariff item. Finally. dutyfree treatment of imported feathers and downs would not adversely affect domestic producers of waterfowl feathers and downs. According to the Department of Commerce. such growers do not expect the elimination of duty to reduce sales since the demand for downfilled sleeping bags and garments is strong and expanding rapidly.

In the last 2 weeks. the North Vietnamese have released the remains of 23 American POWs who died while imprisoned. Under existing law. the Government will pay funeral benefits to the nextofkin. or provide burial without charge in military cemeteries. However. there is no provision for transportation of the immediate family to the burial site. This may seem a small matter. but consider the plight of Cecile Abbott. widow of Navy Capt. John Abbott. Her husbands body will be interred in Arlington Cemetery. Since she lives in Sacramento. Calif.. she will have to pay a considerable sum for transportation for herself and her son to the funeral. Transportation expenses have not been provided to families of deceased servicemen in the past. but this is not the usual situation. Many of these POW families spent years of uncertainty and mental agony. not knowing whether their loved one was dead or alive. Mrs. Abbott. for example. had no word of her husbands fate from 1966. when she received notification he had been shot down. until 1973. when the Paris peace accords were signed. Under circumstances like this. we should do everything in our power to lessen the suffering of these families. According to the Post article. negotiations are still being conducted for the release of the bodies of 32 other American servicemen who had been imprisoned in South Vietnam. Mr. President. at a small cost to the taxpayer. we can take a giant step toward honoring the memories of those brave men who made the supreme sacrifice. Further. we will honor the courage and strength of the families who exhibited such emotional stamina during a most difficult period. It is the least we can do for them. Therefore.

I have been fighting the Eximbank on this issue because of my opposition to two Russian energy deals: a pending $49.5 million loan application for natural gas exploration in the Yakutsk field in eastern Siberia. and credits at 6 percent interest to help finance the $7.6 billion North Star gas development project in western Siberia. If our taxpayers are going to subsidize energy development. the improvement should be made here. not in Siberia. so that we reap the benefits of the investment. and so we do not subject ourselves to future risks of being cut off from foreign energy supplies. I am also concerned with this being yet another example of usurpation of congressional power by an agency of the executive branch. The GAO ruling is quite clear on the language and original intent of the law requiring the President to make a determination that each ExportImport Bank transaction with a Communist nation is in the national interest.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. to further amplify on what my friend from Ohio stated we had Mr. Ruckelshaus. the EPA Administrator before our committee and I addressed questions relating to the Los Angeles area in particular. because Los Angeles is considered to have one of the higher smog levels in the United States. due to the unique atmospheric conditions and the heavy concentration of automobile traffic. In summarizing his response. he said: If we are going to resolve the congestion and pollution problems in the Los Angeles area within an early time frame. the quickest way to get some results is to go in the direction of the highwayrelated preferentialbuslane concept. The Los Angeles area is unique and the rightofway problems are many. I am sure the same thing would apply in some of the other areas of the country. In those areas that do have rail mass transit. and we will use New York rail. as an example. New York still has a major congestion problem. They are going to need the highwayrelated public transportation system to supplement the rail mass transit systems. This would apply in Chicago. Philadelphia. the San Francisco Bay area. and other major metropolitan areas. The only point I am attempting to make is that we will need every dollar we can allocate from the highway trust fund to develop the highwayrelated public transportation system. which will help most of the urban communities in the country. large and small alike. The leadtime requirements. the rightofway problems. the environmental impact requirements are of major significance and magnitude. The WrightClausen alternative to the Anderson amendment is designed to provide the desired flexibility and the positive financial commitment to both mass transit and a safer. more efficient and functional national highway system for both urban and rural America alike. I hope the committee will reject the Anderson amendment and support the committee position that was approved by the commitee on a recorded 29to8 vote.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the issue we must directly point toward is the fact that mass transit will be financed either in the general fund or out of the trust fund. The logic of the situation is that there is not enough money in the trust fund. and the trust fund is not generating enough money to do both jobs. Three billion dollars of general revenue is provided in the bill for mass transit. if the urban centers decide that is what they have to have. It becomes a contractual obligation of our Federal Treasury if the urban government decides that this is what it wants to do. It forfeits its trust fund money. it goes back into the trust fund. it stays right where it should be directed toward the needs which are so pressing for Interstate Highway Systems. Some say that there is money in the trust fund. There is some money in the trust fund. but it is overoblgated. All the money in the trust fund is obligated for specific problems which affect districts which we represent throughout the Nation. The Interstate System is designed to move traffic through or around our urban centers. We are placed at a distinct disadvantage if we allow urban areas to say. \"We do not need interstate highways through our city. we want a mass transit system.\" Then the motoring public will have to devise some method to go around the city or get through it on its own. I believe the point of wisdom directs us to follow the course which has been so completely thought out and worked out. as it is set out in this bill. I insist that we do consider seriously holding what we have in the bill.",

I would like to rise in general support of the Federal Highway Act of 1973. and its authorizations for continued efforts to build safe and efficient road systems linking the major population centers of this country. These systems should be carried through to completion. especially in those areas of the United States and the Midwest where there are gaps in construction. I would also. at this time. like to express my support for the Anderson amendment to the committee bill. Passage of this critical amendment would give local authorities the option of using some of their trust fund allocation for specific types of capital improvements and construction on urban transit systems. I believe that such use of the trust funds is highly consistent with the original purpose of the trustthe promotion and implementation of rapid and safe tranmsit from one place to another in this country. If we are to enjoy the continued use of the automobile in metropolitan areas. if we are to relieve the congestion that plagues our cities. and if we are to meet air pollution standards of the future. we must immediately upgrade and expand our urban mass transit systems. If we do not take this step. our only alternative is to restrict the use of the automobile in the central city. Just about every major city in the United States. as well as the smaller municipalities. is facing a major crisis in urban transit of one sort or another. In my own area. the 10th Congressional District of Illinois. the city of Evanston is about to lose one of its two mass transit alternatives. the Evanston Bus Co. Approval of the Anderson amendment to open up the trust fund would give Evanston the option of using its share of trust funds to aid the busline. and thereby relieve the highway traffic congestion in the city and surrounding areas.

I would like to congratulate my distinguished colleagues on the committee for their efforts on the Federal Highway Act. and urge my colleagues on the floor to support the Anderson amendment to round out the full intent of the act.",

I have been a very active practicing lawyer for years and years. more years than I care to think about. in the New York courts in every conceivable kind of practice. trial. appellate. criminal. civil. and so forth. My abhorrence for crime. my reasonable knowledge of how prosecutions go. and what deterrents mean. the issue of plea bargaining are not strangers to me. nor is the reluctance of juries to convict when they think the penalty is too tough and they may let the accused off on that ground. Unreasonable severity can be counterproductive. But laying all that aside. the fact Is there are no absolutes in these matters. That is all I am saying. Sentences have to be matched to existing conditions to determine what should be done. I would like to point out that the Senator from Indiana said that the Committee on the Judiciary is busy. When I vant to get something done. I give it to a busy man. They are also experienced. I do not think they would let the Senate down. I might not like what I get. They might recommend much more severe penalties. This is fine. That is their duty. Second. I think the Sanator from Georgia himself must recognize they will have this amendment before them.

I do agree with the Senators contention that we must eliminate the effects big money has on politics. I share his desire to reform campaign finances to get down to a very low limit on individual contributions. I spoke at length on this question on this floor yesterday. In fact. I advanced a suggestion which included a $250 ceiling on individual campaign contributionsonly a little above what the Senator has proposed. Our intent is to reach the same point. to reform what is now happening in politics in our country. But the key element in such a limitation must be public financing. as the distinguished chairman of the committee made plain in his remarks a few moments ago. Public financing is not the Issue before us today. and there is no provision for public financing in the Senator from Wisconsins amendment. Without public financing. the $100 limit would place an impossible obstacle on most nonincumbents. I think we must refrain from writing laws that serve the selfinterest of incumbents. as we fulfill our responsibility to write the laws of this land. In this field and in all others. I know. of course. that that is not the purpose of the Senator from Wisconsin. But even an incumbent. in most cases. would be required to put so much time and effort into fund raising that it could become the principal activity of their campaignsrather than meeting the voters. talking about the issues. or developing positions on matters other than raising money. In California. under the bill before us as presently drafted. a Senate candidate would be allowed to spend $4.9 million. Under the amendment offered by Senator PROXMIRE. a candidate running for the Senate would be forced to find 49.000 people willing to contribute $100 each. That is a staggering project. clearly beyond the capacity of individual candidates.",

I know about much of this from the people who contributed far in excess of $1.000. $10.000. $25.000 in order that the McGovern campaign could launch the mail. radio. and TV program which brought in the small contributions.

The Senators amendment could force a greater dependence on political parties by candidates. which could be a step toward bossism. I know that it is our desire to reduce bossism over candidates and people in public office. But if this amendment were adopted. a candidate would. I think. be apt to go to his party to raise money for his campaign. The party in his State could proceed to negotiate with him. saying. \"We will support you if you will do this. that. and the other thing. If the candidate did not want to give up his inderendence. the party might turn to another candidate whom they could control. and provide him with a lush campaign chest.

His passing marks the end of a career that left a lasting imprint not only on the face of my community but upon the legislative bodies of American government at the State. local. and Federal level. My friendship with Mayor West covered two decades. During the early political years of my late brother. Lyle. and then during my early political years. I always welcomed -the counsel and advice of the mayor. My father and Ben Wests father were friends in the late twenties and early thirties when they were both employed at the railroad. Much of my progressive outlook is a result of my exposure to his political outlook as well as his great personal vision. It was through the tenacity of Ben West in pursuing an impossible task against overwhelming odds that the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately rendered its vital Baker against Carr decision which brought about legislative reapportionment in America on the basis of one man one vote. At the height of his career. there was no abler municipal official in America than Ben West. And throughout his career. for those who understand and appreciate the talent. there was no abler practitioner of the art of politics than the dynamic. shrewd. and acutely astute Ben West. In politics. perhaps as in life. the sweetest words are words of praise uttered by your political enemies. Throughout most of his career Ben West found himself politically at odds. oftcn bitterly. with the morning newspaper of our community. the Nashville Tennessean. Yet on his death the dean of Tennessee political reporters. Mr. Joe Hatcher. who for years knew and covered the career of Ben West. stated: \"Politically I was opposed to West throughout his career . . .\" However. Hatcher added: \"Ben West probably will be recorded In history as one of Nashvilles great mayors. of the great mayors of this nation.\" Mr. Speaker. Mr. Hatcher is not guilty of overstatement.

We have been told to expect the price of sugar and sugar products to go still higher in the months ahead. The sugar industry blames the high prices on a worldwide sugar shortage. Yet the excessive profits recently announced by major American sugar companies has led me. along with thousands of consumers. to suspect that the industry itself Is driving prices up In an attempt to maximize its profits. That conclusion is buttressed by reports published this past weekend that sugar Is selling in Mexico. just across the American border. for about 10 cents a pound while American consumers are paying more than 60 cents a pound In supermarkets across the United States. Yesterday I submitted testhnony on this important consumer issue to the Presidents Council on Wage and Price Stability which is holding public hearings on the price of sugar.

I argued that this program to free natural gas and oil shale by the use of nuclear detonations should be abandoned. Nuclear stimulation could provide but a drop in the bucket toward meeting our national energy needs. hardly worth the economic and environmental risks of further development. After some 10 years of experimentation and three test events in the Rocky Mountain West at a cost of more than $34 million. it has not produced a single cubic foot of gas for market. Two recent developments at Project Rio Blanco in Colorado. the most recent test. support my position. It has been established that the three cavities at Rio Blanco failed to connect due to a basic technological flaw. which raises serious doubts about the economic feasibility of this process.

The Committee on Aeronautics and Transportation has been part of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce since its inception in the late 1700s. In fact. transportation was the first element placed in the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. The Bolling committee totally removes transportation from Interstate Commerce.

Mr. Chairman. aviation is also under the Railway Labor Act. Just as barge lines and truck lines are under the regulation of the ICC.

Tex.. on August 13. 1906. was not only completely unjustified but unconscionable in the extreme.

Remember that we had a hold harmless provision for all of the differential when we first initiated the program. As an example of how this will work. assume a States payment. together with income. averaged $200 per recipient in January 1972. The State made plans to provide supplemental payments of $70 with the Federal payment of $130. which is the amount that has been in the law. and the amount we would increase it to is $140. Without this amendment the State has two options: it can reduce the $70 to $60 so that the income to the beneficiaries will be the same. or else it can provide $10 of its own funds and thus make a $70 payment to the beneficiary and provide the same increase in total income as there is in the Federal benefit. The committee was very much afraid some States would not be able to make either of these choices in the time available and accordingly provided temporary relief to the States. so that to the extent they have problems they would not be put in an impossible situation on January 1. These are the principal provisions of the bill.

Mr. Chairman. the situation is even more unfair than the gentlewoman indicated. It is not just considering the person living on social security in a State where the benefits may be a little higher than the average. There are people receiving social security benefits at the minimum level who are ineligible for SSI only because they may not have the assets in some form that is contemplated in the regulations. the regulations I might say which are promulgated by the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare and that are in themselves onerous and burdensome. Mr. Chairman. there is one additional point I would like to establish. if I may. while the gentlewoman has the time. and that is this: That point. simply stated. is that under the current law every State in the Nation is entitled to no less than 50 percent matching for the adult public assistance program. and this scale graduates up to. I believe. 83 percent in the lower per capita income States. But all the States today have matching ranging from 50 percent up to 83 percent. This financing is completely rearranged. under the new SSI program. ultimately to protect the Federal interests and the Federal taxpayer. The new SSI financing arrangement will work as follows: In more than half of the States. the existing matching is increased from the current 50 to 83 percent. to. starting in January. a 100percent Federal program. resulting in a cost reduction. therefore. of from 17 to 50 percent for more than half of the States. However. in the instance of the higher cost of living. higher grant States. the matching for those States is no longer 50 percent. their percentage of Federal assistance has not increased. To the contrary. it has been effectively reduced to something on the order of from 50 percent down to 30 percent.",

This House with this bill H.R. 11333 will have increased the benefits by 68.5 percent since January 1970. while the Consumer Price Index has only gone up 19.6 percent in the same period. Second. This represents a tax increase for 20 million middleincome Americans who tend to bear more and more of the burden of government. Third. The committee has failed to properly evaluate the actuarial assumptions with the end result that the cost will undoubtedly be much morein billions of dollarswhich means more deficit financings. that is. more tax dollars for interest charges for debt.

To pay for the raise in benefits. the bill would also provide for a broadening of the wage base for social security taxes. I am also pleased that H.R. 11333 includes an automatic cost of living increase to begin in June 1975. should costs rise more than an annualized rate of 3 percent for the previous three or four calendar quarters. For my own part. in my congressional district and as a member of the House Republican task force on aging. I have found that many older Americans encounter difficulty living in the comfort and dignity to which they are entitled after productive lives as wage earners and parents. The recent tremendous increases in the cost of living have made this even more apparent. and I believe if we in Congress had waited until next July to make a social security benefit increase effective. the Nations senior citizens would have found it even harder to live on their small annuities. After paying taxes all their lives. our older Americans have the right to be as independent and active as possible. Additional social security payments will assist them in this respect.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have long been interested in the problems related to illiteracy and reading deficiencies in this country and in seeking a solution to the problems. Last year I introduced the National Reading Improvement Act of 1972. and I intend to introduce a revised version of that bill in the very near future. I have been convinced by many reading experts that all children can learn to read. But the fact remains that each year schools are turning out children. not just as dropouts. but high school graduates and even college graduates. who cannot read. There are no easy answers as to why this is happening in our socalled advanced educational system. But it is clear that a concerted effort must be made by the Federal Government. by State education agencies. by local school officials. and by individual teachers to meet the problem and to overcome it. I believe the necessity for this is best expressed by Dr. Thomas C. Little. superintendent in Richmond. Va.: The level of literacy has always been a measure of the progress of a civilization. [I] is readingthe ability to see a printed word. to comprehend its meaning. to evaluate its contentswhich is the one historic path upward and outward for the civilized man. Mr. President. this mornings Washington Post carried a column by William Raspberry entitled \"Teach Them to Read.\" Mr. Raspberrys column deals with a WMALTV special entitled \"Teach Them To Read.\" to be aired Friday evening from 89 p.m. The program attempts to demonstrate why so many of our schools are failing to teach children to read. and to show how other schools are able to teach reading successfully. I ask unanimous consent to print the column in the RECORD SO that my colleagues will have the opportunity to know something about this important program in advance. I urge that every Member who is able watch the special so that he may have a better understanding of the most crucial problem facing our educational system today.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. actions yesterday. at home and abroad. brought more bad economic news for all Americans. And. it brought a further indictment of the Nixon administrations economic program. Large banking institutions are reported to be on the verge of increasing the prime lendingrate from 71/4 to 71/2 in the immediate future. Chauncey E. Schmidt of the First National Bank of Chicago called for a rate \"in the range of 7% to 8 percent.\" Mr. President. this \"creeping interest\" spells more trouble for the American consumerand higher profits for the big banks. Consumer credit cost will increase and housing mortgage cost will increaseabout this there can be no doubt. There is a possibility of a \"credit crunch\" setting in. as the Nixon administration blindly acquieses in the upward bound of interest rates. At the same time. Mr. President. the dollar took its biggest plunge in overseas markets in recent months while the price of gold on the Zurich market soared to $123.75 an ounce. Country national banks are selling dollars as if there were no tomorrow. And. things are likely to get worse. Four years ago. the German mark was worth 25 cents. Today. the dollar buys 2.50 West German marks. The Nixon administration does not want to speculate on what the dollar will be worth in the future. Amidst the economic disaster besetting our country. the Nixon administrations chief economic spokesman states that he is \"puzzled.\" Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz claims that the weakness of the dollar in the international currency markets is a \"puzzling matter.\" And. he echoes the same old tired administration theme that an end to inflation Is just around the corner. that there will be a leveling off of cost increases. and that things are going to get better. Mr. President. what we need is not more propaganda from the administration. We need action. Hard. tough. fair action. Mr. President.

The bill as it had been presented to us by the House carried a higher authorization. Then the Senate sustained the Public Works Committee on the bill as reported by the Senate committee. and we reduced the authorization and went into conference with the House on it. During the conference the question whether or not this would meet with Presidential approval was gone into very thoroughly by the Republicans and Democrats who constituted the committee of conference. It was in this spirit that we tried to comply with the expectations of the White House. and we arrived at a figure which was a little above the Senate figure but much below the House figure as it had been submitted to us in the original bill as passed by the House. So I say that now the bill contains a total authorization of $430 million. The bill as passed by the Senate contained an authorization of $362.5 million. compared to the original authorization in the House bill of $1.222.500.000. It is my feeling that. if the Senate concurs in the conference report. we stand a very good chance of getting it approved by the President and we will have an extension of the Economic Development Act for another year.",

I think the conference report reflects the best efforts of the conferees to meet the administration more than half way on the matter of expenditures. Approval of the bill by the Congress and by the President will also give us a year to make an appropriate transition to improved programs to aid the cause of economic development. Neither the Congress nor the President can afford to let the EDA program die before we have had a chance to develop useful and effective alternative institutions. I believe the measure approved by the committee of conference provides us with the opportunity to continue necessary efforts at the same time we are working to develop new methods and programs to achieve goals on which we are all in agreement. This is a minimum program for the transition period. We owe the Nation no less than this effort. I urge adoption of the conference report. I yield back the remainder of my time.",

Under this amendment the Secretary of Agriculture would be authorized to initiate multiyear setaside contracts relating to acreage setaside or diverted to conserving uses under the wheat feed grain and cotton programs.

The amount becomes even more realistic when we remember that the amendment contemplates coverage for water system alone. Mr. President. the Senate is Strongly on record as supporting the continuation of grants for water systems. In my statement of June 4. I indicated that while loans are helpful. grants remain essential. The high cost of developing a rural water system means that user fees will often be insufficient to meet the financial requirements of developing an adequate water system in a rural area. The administration recognizes the need for grants for sewer systems when it relies on the Water Pollution Control Amendments for this purpose. I see no reason why water systems should be singled out for exclusion from Federal grant assistance. There really is no alternative means of financing for these systems. We cannot expect local communities to absorb the high costs of developing and constructing the water systems. Neither should we expect revenue sharing to be used as an alternate source of assistance. Congress expected that revenue sharing would be additional money for local communities and not that it be utilized to replace existing programs which the administration unilaterally chose to extinguish. Because the justification for rural water systems has long been recognized by the Senate. and because this amendment goes a long way toward meeting the administrations objections to the previous bill on the subject. I hope that it will be accepted as an effort on the part of Congress to meet pressing needs in rural areas. while at the same time recognizing the fiscal contraints under which our Government is operating.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I was greatly discouraged. as were countless Americans. by yesterdays 6 to 3 Supreme Court decision which stated that income tax credits and tuition reimbursements for parents of parochial school children are in violation of the Constitution. Local officials and school district administrators from one end of the country to the other have been searching in vain for an effective answer to a problem which threatens not only to decimate the long established parochial school system. but also to result in the intolerable overcrowding of our public school network. The Courts regrettable decision on tax credits has outlawed what appeared to be a promising solution to the school aid dilemma. A majority of the justices were of the opinion that benefits provided to citizens by New York or Pennsylvania in order to provide indirect support for the necessary parochial school system were in opposition to the churchstate separation assured by the first amendment. A New York State plan involving financial support for the maintenance of private and parochial schoolchildren was also disallowed. and a third setback came when the Court struck down New Yorks plan of reimbursement for educational testing and other services which are required of the States private schools by law. Mr. Speaker. I am not of the opinion that these defeats have put an end to this battle. The problems still remain. In my homecity. for example. one parochial school after another is being forced to close its doors for financial reasonsand this after 20..30. 40 or more years of high quality service to the community. Where will the children go? Where are they going now? Quite simply. they are being packed into already overcrowded classrooms. into public schools marked by a lamentable shortage of everything from qualified teachers to safe recreational f acilities. The next skirmish will probably be over such mechanisms as reimbursement for auxiliary servicesguidance counseling. remedial reading. advanced studies. and so forthor Federal- and Statesupported voucher systems which would permit parents more leeway to pay for educating their children at the school of their choice.

Kelley. and I urge that the Senate speedily confirm his nomination. I have known C. M. Kelley since he was named chief of police of Kansas City in 1961. when I was attorney general of Missouri. I am acquainted with his record as chief. and I am also acquainted with his record of 21 years of service with the FBI prior to his Kansas City appointment. The entire record is superb. I will not go through it all here. But I do want to point out that in 1961 Chief Kelley took over a factionalized police department -which had been tinged by scandal. and built it into an excellent force known for its innovative approach -to law enforcement. Among his accomplishments in Kansas City have been the formation of a metro squad. which handles major cases in a multicounty area in two States. the introduction of operation barrier. a sys.tem of roadblocks throughout the city to catch fleeing suspects. the establishment of a computer operation which las -been described as the best in the country. introduction of a roundtheclock helicopter patrol program. and an expanded community relations program. The Senate Judiciary Committee. under the distinguished leadership of Senator EASTLAND. has extensively explored Chief Kelleys past record and his current beliefs. The committee reported out his nomination unanimously. I urge the Senate to confirm him.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like very much to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Missouri. Being a member of the Judiciary Committee and having attended many of the hearings. I find that Chief Kelley was very candid in his remarks and had a very deep insight into both the Federal Bureau and police operations and the functioning at the local level. Obviously the record shows that he was with the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 20 years. Really. his life has been devoted to this work. I commend the Senator from Missouri for his remarks in regard to Mr. Kelley and would hope that the Senate would act speedily so that the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have a permanent Director and we can look forward to a degree of stability within the Department. I might also add that I hope the Senate will seriously consider the proposal that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia will very shortly propose. a bill that would establish two 10year terms for the Director of the Federal Bureau. I might say that in the course of the interrogation of Mr. Kelley. he indicated that he was very much amicable to this. He thought it was a good basis upon which we could adopt a term office. I would hope that during the course of this debate on Chief Kelley. we will not lose sight of the fact that it is the desire of. I would assume. a majority of the members of the Committee on the Judiciaryand this is merely an assumption on my partthat the Senate move speedily toward the passage of a bill that would establish a 10year term for the Director of the Bureau. and that he be subject to reappointment for not more than one additional 10year term.",

Mr. Kelley. answering questions I and other members on the Senate Judiciary Committee put to him. made clear he will not let the FBI become a partisan arm of any political party or special interest. Mr. Kelley made clear that he will not campaign for candidates. He made clear he will not turn over sensitive FBI files to political henchmen. He made clear he will study and implement safeguards to prevent leaks and to purge unverified rumors from the computerized data on millions of Americans. He also agreed to submit to thorough congressional oversight on all aspects of FBI activity.

It is a measure which provides for the establishment of a commission to study the usage. customs. and laws relating to the flag of the United States. As we approach our Nations bicentennial celebration and make preparation for that great event. I feel this matter becomes increasingly important. Over the years. confusion over the appropriate means of displaying our flag has reached a point of bewilderment. All branches of the armed services have developed their own codes which differ considerably from one another. Some codes prohibit display of the flag at night. while others allow this with special lighting arrangements. Some codes prohibit display of the Flag in inclement weather. while others provide for the use of special allweather flags. There is even confusion over the appropriate place of honor for the flag when it is flown together with others. The Senator from Rhode Island and I feel the time has come to establish a uniform code of flag conduct.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today introducing a bill that would move the elections for Federal offices ahead by 1 month. to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in October. I believe that the bill would reduce the lengthy campaign period. curtail the exorbitant costs of campaigning. provide a longer period after election day for resolving election disputes. and avoid. in some areas of the country. the severe winter weather that contributions to keeping citizens away from the polls. The most recent election clearly showed that a bill of this nature is needed. Less than 55 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots. which represented the smallest turnout since the 1948 election. I think the length of the campaign was largely responsible for this small turnout. By the time election day arrived. I believe that many citizens had already had their fill of politics. and their interest had waned to the point that millions of Americans simply stayed home. And there is no doubt that longer campaigns demand more money. Some early estimates indicate that as much as $400 million was spent on the November elections. and authorities claim that it now takes $40 million to elect a President. more than $200.000 to elect a Senator. and about $100.000 to elect a Representative. The 92d Congress took a giant step toward cutting campaign costs by passing the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. and I feel that my bill to move Federal elections ahead by 1 month would further help to roll back the tide of rising campaign costs. The language of the United States Constitutionwhich is quoted belowclearly empowers Congress to prescribe the date for holding elections for President. Vice President. U.S. Senators. and Representatives and there are no restrictions set in the Constitution on the date which Congress. in its judgment. may set for national elections. There is therefore no constitutional reason why Congress may not legislate to change the date for holding national elections from November to October.

Many millions of us set out to make real the basic American goal of equal justice and equal opportunity for all. But because of its drain on our energies and our resources. the Vietnam war sadly diverted our Nation from pursuit of that goal. Ten years after the death of John Kennedy. millions of Americans still face discrimination in employmentpoor schools--slumsstreet crimeinadequate housingimproper health careand injustices in our courts and before our administrative bodies. The shortages of fuels and energy further threaten to deepen the gulf between the poor and the more well to do. Some of the \"solutions\" to the energy crisis I have heard would undoubtedly move us headlong toward a society of energy \"haves\" and energy \"have nots.\" a society in which the rich would get richer and the poor would go without transportation. heat or jobs. There has been some progress in recent years. most strikingly in politics. The election of Tom Bradley as mayor of Los Angeles is a national symbol of triumph over race fear and race prejudice. Many other cities in California and elsewhere. including the South. have elected officials from the ranks of the blacks. Chicanos. Asians and other minorities. I believe the new political power that minority groups have properly gained must be translated into further economic and social gainsgains to be made not on the basis of artificial quota systems but on the truly democratic basis of equal opportunity. Equal opportunity is the keythe operative conceptfor economic and social progress in a free society. The Federal Government. with its massive resources and the prestige and power of its national institutions. must exercise the moral leadership in bringing about equal opportunity for all. But all levels of government. and all private institutions. also have a responsibility to root out inequality and discrimination wherever they appear. Elsewhere in this newsletter.

Section 8 provides that. beginning 6 months after the date of adoption of procedures for determining and disclosing annual operating costs. the retailers will have to label their major household appliances. giving those annual costs on the label. However. section 20 of the act has two different sets of procedures for establishing annual operating costs. One set of procedures is contained in section 20(b). which provides that. beginning 12 months after the date of enactment of the bill. interim procedures have to be developed for disclosing annual operating costs of major household products. Then. sections (c) through (i) provide for a 30month period in which the manufacturers must develop test results for establishing annual operating costs of major household appliances. The 12month period relates to interim procedures. the 30month period relates to more permanent procedures. So what we do in this technical amendment is to make very clear that the labeling provisions of this act will apply 6 months after both the 12month interim procedures are announced by the Commission. and the 30month period for determination of test results by the manufacturers in accordance with the permanent procedures announced by the Commission. It is a technical amendment. It just clarifies the language of the proposed legislation. and it is supported by the Committee on Commerce.",

What is required is a statement of annual operating cost only if the price of the appliance is advertised. So. if the price of a stove is advertised at $250. the answer would have to be that the annual operating cost. for example. is $30 a year. It is that simple. And if the supplier wants to advertise -what the cost of an appliance is. there is no reason why he should not tell the consumer what the operating cost is going to be. considering that today in Massachusetts and in New York we have appliance bills which have passedthe laws are on the booksand other jurisdictions are beginning to pass laws that relate to appliance labeling. The major manufacturers have to comply with those laws. and with the local ordinances and laws as they apply to appliance labeling. We have a preemption clause in this measure. and I can assure the Senator that the major manufacturers are happy about that. because they do not want to have to comply with a different law in Massachusetts. a different law in New York. a different law in California. and other areas are also beginning to put legislation on their books as they pertain to appliance labeling and energy consumption.

This first supplemental appropriation bill for fiscal year 1975 is a very large bill. both in terms of funds and items. and is made up of many appropriations that would normally be considered in connection with the regular. annual appropriations bills.

Of signal importance is the fact that the elected State and national officials among the Democrats provided guidance and constructively contributed to the work of the convention. This is a happy change from the conventions of 1968 and 1972. especially the latter. The rioting of 1968 in Chicago brought division and defeat to the Democratic Party in a very close election. The farce. which was called a convention in 1972. when the convention was controlled to an extent by people who came in off the streets without the benefit of any elective process. real or imagined. resulted in the collapse of the party as an effective national force in that election. Now. the party is moving soundly forward as a national organization which again offers an umbrella to all those who seek a sound and progressive America and are willing to work together to achieve it. Unstinting praise is due to Robert Strauss. as the guiding light of the long and tedious process of reconstructing the party machinery and to former Gov. Terry Sanford. of North Carolina. who contributed so much to the formulation of a new and effective charter under which Democrats can and will move forward.",

    "speech": "The time has come to pass a bill and do away with the cloud of uncertainty which has hung over the legal services program around the country. Resort to the courts for the solution of grievances is one of the most fundamental. enduring rights of citizenship. This ideal is readily embraced by most Americans as a fundamental right under our Constitution. As a matter of fact. the influence of our legal structure on the daily lives of most Americans is enormous. Permit me to quote from the testimony of a legal aid recipient before hearings I chaired in Iowa in April 1973: The lowincome people need the counsel of the law professions as much. if not more. than the middle and upper income classes. To say that these people do not have the right or the need is stupid. The average lawyer will not handle a case involving a lowincome I feel. because of the lack of monetary gain. If America is a land of equal opportunity. then we must provide an equal chance for the lowincome people to have counsel. The only way we have to meet a large portion of this need is the use of the legal aid agencies. The ghetto areas need these lawyers for all types of problems. but predominately because of business racketeers who have large operations in their areas. The ghettos also come under garnishments often and easier. I am convinced that the effort to make legal counsel available to everyone has been one of the single most important programs launched by the Federal Government for needy Americans. In Iowa our legal aid programs have been successful in countless ways unknown and unrecorded. except by the recipients themselves. They have been a major force for good in the State. and with an ongoing Federal commitment they could do much more. I ask unanimous consent that a number of news stories and editorials from the Iowa press be included in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last week. I hoped to be able to lend my support and vote to the conference report on the Legal Services Corporation Act. That report. though creating a corporation with severe limitations on the types of services that could be provided and highly questionable controls on the staff attorneys funded through it. did at least preserve the vital components of the present legal services program. The process in which we are now engaged. based on an agreement between the administration and the Senate leadership on this legislation. will restructure the legal services program by placing .the backup functions of research. technical assistance. and training directly under the corporation. The backup services have been critical to the effective representation of the poor by the 13 federally funded legal services programs in Michigan. Local attorneys. often overworked in severely understaffed programs. were vitally dependent upon national backup assistance. They relied upon current developments in national poverty law specialties. research on complex issues. the training of young attorneys in litigation skills and substantive areas not covered by traditional legal education. These services and more were made available to legal services attorneys in Michigans State and local programs to enable them to successfully carry out their professional responsibilities. It is clearly not the intent of this legislative compromise to eliminate these vital services or even to reduce their scope. Some of the backup functionsresearch. training. technical assistancewill be carried on directly by the corporation either through inhouse centers or other mechanisms including the purchase of consultant services from those experienced in their delivery. Local or State programs could be provided funds to assure that training of the younger attorneys was carried out. Nor is it the intent of this legislation to alter the delivery of legal services to eligible clients by national. State. and local programs funded with the capacity to carry on specialized litigation. administrative. or legislative representation. appellate assistance. and group representation. The OEO legal services program has wisely funded such programs to make available to our citizens who cannot afford lawyers the opportunity for full and complete professional representation wherever legal assistance is necessary. This legislative compromise provides authority to the corporation under section 1006(a) (1) to assure the continuation of the vital litigating and advocacy programs in Michigan.",

He strikes out the definition of a market emergency which is defined to be a significant intervention of foreign governments in the futures market. war. and other national emergencies. His amendment strikes that out. We think it is rather essential we keep those provisions in this bill. We know that the bill cannot give us a 100percent guarantee against that sort of thing in the future. but we believe it does give a rather substantial assurance and does give this Commission the authority that was lacking 2 years ago. We do provide that new authority and we think it is right and important that we keep this in. Therefore. I would hope we defeat the amendment.",

As a cosponsor of the Vanik bill in the House. I feel strongly that this question must be resolved as a precondition to the discussion of this issue by the Congress. I was interested. however. in an article which appeared in the Exodus. a newspaper of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews. which appeared in the February 1973 issue. raising the question of whether or not expanded trade with the Soviet Union is in our best interests under any circumstances. considering the monetary and nonmonetary costs involved. Cited. for example. was James Restons column which expressed concern that continued and expanded trade with the U.S.S.R. for such things as energy sources controlled by the Soviets would create an unhealthy dependency. which risks the possibilityin the event of a military emergencythat these products could be cut off. According to Reston. trade dependency of this type could present a real security problem for the United States. Also mentioned. was the definitive study of Soviet trade by Dr..Anthony Sutton. of Stanford University. which has shown that in the past 10 years of trading with the Soviet Union. products made in the United States have turned up in Sovietmade tanks and trucks found in Vietnam and on the Israeli borders. Dr. Suttons conclusion: If a decade of such trade (it began in the early 60s) did not produce peace. why multiply the problem. Historicallywhen you consider lendleasethe Soviet Union has proven to be a poor credit risk. To make matters even worse. products that are now being purchased by the U.S.S.R. are being financed by the already overburdened American taxpayer. And what is often overlooked when we talk about our balanceof -payments deficit is that in recent years the largest part of the deficit is not in the actual trade balance itself. but in foreign capital investment. Mr. Speaker. as food for thought. I ask that the article mentioned in the Exodus for February 1973 follow my remarks at this point.",

This concern extends to all viewers. but is most acute when thought of in terms of the numbers of children each day who are being exposed to muggings. shootouts. and other heinous crimes while innocently sitting in their living rooms. It is estimated that a normal American child is exposed to nearly a million and a quarter of such televised crimes during his childhood and adolescent years. Furthermore. a recent Surgeon Generals committee report. released a year ago. has concluded that there exists a \"causal link\" between violence on television and violence in society. And yet I am much disturbed to report that in the face of acute concern and mounting scientific verification. there has been no substantial action by the FCC regarding this ongoing problem. I have introduced a joint resolution this session which would direct the FCC to investigate the effects of the display of violence in television programs. There is no doubt that such an investigation would be greatly aided by a universally accepted data base showing the amounts of violence being aired by each individual station across the Nation. It has come to my attention that there is now pending before the FCC a petition for rulemaking which would require just such a list of violent episodes shown on entertainment programs during a representative week. The list would be incorporated as part of the regular broadcast station requirements for license renewal. Such logs of violent incidents would then be available. not only to the FCC. but also to Members of Congress. social scientists. and any concerned public citizen. The petition was prepared and submitted by a group of George Washington University Law students organized as VIOLENTviewers intent on listing violent episodes on nationwide televisionunder the direction of Prof. John Banzhaf III. The FCC is presently accepting letters of comment regarding the petition. and I would like to include itin the RECORD at this time in order that concerned citizens may read it: [Before the Federal Communications Commission.

In light of the current interest of OEO. I ask that the section concerning poverty in Mr. Whites article be printed in the RECORD. as follows: The long effort of the Democrats to discredit the Presidents budget as excessively harsh toward the poor and too generous toward the Pentagon is losing for several reasons. including the oldest of all possible reasons. It will fail in the end primarily because it is untrue to suggest that Mr. Nixon is \"turning the clock back\" and gutting social welfare. Taking the budget in the aggregate he is planning to spend more. rather than less. on welfare. What he is really trying to do is to cut or to cut down only some programs. notably the highly compassionate but also highly ineffectual \"war on poverty\" that he inherited from the Johnson administration. What are being chopped down. or at. are schemes that either wont work or are intolerably costly for what they accomplish. Though thtre are undeniably scattered instances of hardship for some people in this approach. the central reality is that the President is trying both to clear up a horrendous federal welfare mess based on too much belief that Washington knows best and to fight the real enemy of the poor. which is called Inflation. As truth actually does sometimes do. the truth is slowly coming through here. The Democratic attack on the administration is declining in force because of this and because of collateral circumstances. Perhaps the most important of these collateral circumstances is that various pressure groups marshalled under the general but not always honest heading of civil rights are heralding \"a national spring offensive\" against the administration in its entirety. There are threats of street violence as undertones. The political atmosphere has so far changed in the last four years as to make such allies unwelcome even to most of the ultraliberal Democrats themselves. They dont want this association. And so for the most part they are beginning to back away and to moderate rhetoric that had pictured the President as deliberately hardhearted toward the unfortunate.",

The basic bill that would move us into the metric system was introduced by me about 10 years ago. It has been moving along fairly slowly. although the Senate did pass it in the previous Congress. My own view is that it will increase our exports and increase our balance of payments. and that it is to our advantage to be on the metric system. We had a 3year study made by the Department of Commerce and the conclusion it came to. in a comprehensive eight- or ninevolume report. was very much along the same lines. The automobile industry. Henry Ford particularly. have come to the conclusion that by going to the metric system they will be able to meet the competition from abroad and invade the foreign markets. As of now the only countries that enjoy with us the oldfashioned English system are a few countries in Africa and Trinidad. Tabago. Yemen. The British had the good sense to leave their socalled English system a few years ago. I have conferred with the chairman of their Education Committee. who is a relative of mine. who told me that their claims were relatively mild. their costs have been very mild. and their industrial health is prospering every day. There is no other nation in the world other than ours which is holding to this oldfashioned line. As a result. we are continuing to lose many foreign markets. So I believe that the sooner we adopt this method. the better off we will be. For that reason. the provision was included in the bill. Mr. President.

At the very least these costs could be several billion dollars. but estimates put forward in the House went as high as $100 billion. These costs were put on the back of the poor man. because no one could figure out an equitable way to compensate those who must buy new tools. new machines. new signs. and labels. as well as carry the cost of double inventories during the changeover period. I agree that there is no equitable way to compensate for these costs. but my conclusion is that this inequity is a sound reason to avoid unnecessary changeover.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to give an explanation of what happened by calling for the rollcall vote on the motion to table my motion to reconsider the passage of resolution 399. There had been a brief debate on the resolution. It was participated in by two. and possibly threeSenators. This Senator. it is well known in the Chamber and has been for some time. is opposed to both the resolution and the bill. I intend to offer a substitute for the bill in due time. In what I thought was a little precipitous action on the part of the Presiding Officer. the resolution was declared approved inasmuch as no opposition was heard and inasmuch as no one appeared to get up in timely fashion to ask for recognition and ask for further debate. I had anticipated that the ranking member of the Government Operations Committee would speak on the resolution. I apparently did not get up in time in order that the Presiding Officer would be able to recognize me. Now. when he did declare the resolution approved I wanted to suggest. and did suggest. that these three measures should be considered together. not individually. because technically we would have one taken up after the other. but it was for that purpose I rose to make.. a motion to reconsider so that we could have the three of them considered in that light. It was to that motion that the majority leader asserted a motion to table. He told me later. however. that it was his thought that I was making the motion to reconsider as a routine thing so we: could get on to the next piece of business. and I want to respect that assumption. It was made in good faith. but I just did not think it was quite in order that the matter should have been placed on that basis in view of the fact that this is a matter of considerable importance. as I will explain as the day goes on. I just wanted to explain to my colleagues why there was resistance to an apparently routine motion to table a motion to reconsider.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 2 weeks ago. I introduced S. 4016 with the cosponsorship of Senator ERviN and Senator JAVITS. As originally written. the bill concerned only the tape recordings made during Richard M. Nixons tenure as President. The Senate Government Operations Committee. with my support and the cooperation of my staff. has revised the bill to Include other Presidential materials from Mr. Nixons tenure. This legislation is an emergency measure. It will insure that the tape recordings and papers relating to Mr. Nixons Presidency will remain available for use as evidence in pending or forthcoming criminal trials. This bill will also guarantee that. at some point in the near future. the American people will learn the full story behind the Watergate scandals. The need for this legislation is clear. Last month. the White House negotiated an agreement with Mr. Nixon concerning the disposition of papers and materials relating to his tenure as President. Two aspects of that agreement are of particular concern here. First. Mr. Nixon agreed to donate the tapes to the Federal Government by 1979. However. the agreement provides that after that date Mr. Nixon can order the destruction of any tapes he chooses. The agreement also provides \"that such tapes shall be destroyed at the time of Mr. Nixons death or on September 1. 1984. whichever event shall first occur.\" Therefore. if Mr. Nixon should die tomorrow. all the tapes would have to be destroyed. Second. the agreement allows the Federal Government to retain custody over the Presidential papers of Mr. Nixons tenure. But the agreement allows Mr. Nixon to have complete control over access to those papers. Moreover. after 1977 Mr. Nixon can withdraw any papers he chooses for any purpose. This seems to imply that Mr. Nixon can. if he so chooses. destroy any. paper which he withdraws.",

As others have noted. Mrs. HANSEN registered many \"firsts\" during a remarkable 37year career in politics. She was the first woman to serve on the city council of her hometown of Cathamet. Later. she was the first woman elected speaker pro tempore of the Washington State House of Representatives. But among our colleagues. Mr. Speaker. her greatest renown is as the first woman ever to head a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. She has presided with grace and distinction over the Interior Appropriations Subcommitteeand a legislative domain that includes funding for 28 different agencies and 753 million acres of public lands. Several years ago. Mrs. HANSEN was to a considerable extent responsible for initiating the recent reforms in our congressional seniority system. as chairman of the special committee set up to advise the Democratic Caucus on these matters. In large part as a result of her efforts we have spread power around a bit by providing that no member may head more than one subcommittee. and by stipulating that committee chairmen face approval by the caucus. It is possible that when Mrs. HANSEN finally steps aside she will have established a new longevity record for continuous service by a woman in politics. When she set out on her illustrious career. our colleague met and overcame obstacles then impending the progress of women aspiring to high public office and key legislative assignments. The trailblazing by Mrs. HANSEN has made the course a bit easier for the women who follow. Her series of \"firsts\"-these may be her greatest legacy.",

Unfortunately. in 1940 along with her sister republics of Latvia and. Estonia.

Hitlers legions conquered the Lithuanian nation and the Nazis maintained their control until the last days of World War II. With the defeat of Hitler. the Lithuanian people were once again forcibly included into the Soviet system. Mr. Speaker. despite years of oppression the proud Lithuanian spirit is untamed.

In 1922. a constitution according freedom of speech. assembly. religion. and communication was put into effect. The 20 years of Lithuanian independence which followed were marked by great advances in the fields of agriculture and social progress and by important achievements in literature and opera. It was an era which paralleled the great cultural achievements in other historic nations. Unfortunately. this golden era was short lived. On June 15. 1940. the Soviets once again invaded this great country. and Lithuanians were executed and exiled by their Soviet captors. It is a tribute to this great people. however. that no amount of Soviet brutality could break their spirit and their desire for independence. They have had the grit to go on.

It Is always instructive to have as many facts as possible at ones command before making decisions on issues of this importance. It has long been my contention. in business as well as in the Senate. that expanded international trade is in the best interests of this country. Further. it is my contention that expanded international trade is in the best interests of American industry and the American worker. Thus I was most pleased to see an article by James J. Kilpatrick in the Washington Star on October 3. 1973. reporting on the experience of twb U.S. companies which have become actively involved in international trade. The first of these companies is the Caterpillar Tractor Co. of Peoria. Ill. Since 1950. when Caterpillar established its first overseas subsidiary. Caterpillars sales. jobs and exports have grown. Between 1950 and 1972. Caterpillars exports grew from $93 to $800 million. its purchases from domestic suppliers grew from $188 million to more than $1 billion and it has created 20.000 jobs here at home. The second example is that of the Clark Equipment Co. At the same tame that the company has invested abroad in 23 countries. the companys export business has grown from $5 million in 1950 to $96 million in 1972 and 2.800 jobs have been created in this country. Various legislative proposals are pending in Congress that would restrict the right of U.S. companies to invest abroad and which would restrict international trade. Based on the experience of Caterpillar and Clark. it is hard to see what benefit these proposals would bring. In fact. I think they would be very damaging to the prosperity of this country.

    "speech": "report cites the difference in how California veterans were able to make use of the benefits in contrast with New York veterans. In fiscal 1972. Californians used $302.000.000 in benefits. while New Yorkers used $99.000.000. These two states ordinarily get nearly equal shares under most federal programs. however. between fiscal 1968 and fiscal 1972. California veterans used more than $565.000.000 more than New York veterans in GI Bill benefits. This is largely a reflection of the mix of the states postsecondary education system and the lower levels of tuition in California. With few private colleges. a heavily subsidized state system. and a community college system three times as large as New Yorks. the California veteran had much easier access to the GI Bill than did the New York veteran. It should be noted that California veterans take no money away from New York veterans when they use the GI Bill to the extent they do. for the GI Bill contains a unique commitment by Congress to make more money available as more veterans decide to use the benefits. The attached chart shows the great disparities among states in the usage of the GI Bill. On a per capita basis (to show the relation of GI Bill payments to the number of veterans on a statebystate basis). annual educational benefits go from a high of $469 for veterans in North Dakota to a low of $174 for veterans in Virginia. As for the utility of the GI Bill for college or junior college education. 35% of Californias veterans use it. while less than 14% of Indianas veterans do so. This points up the inherent inequity in the practical limits on the way the GI Bill can be used by veterans is various states. Further variances among veterans with different economic and social backgrounds were testified to at the hearings. However. no definitive national statistics exist on this point.",

That such a threat is possible is due in no small measure to our own failure to formulate a sensible. forwardlooking national energy fuels policy. Such a policy has been talked about for years. but. so far. the talk has not been translated into action. It is absolutely essential for the future security of the United States that a national fuels policy be formulated without further delay. and that research and development in our most abundant fossil fuel--coalbe stepped up immediately. The proven reserves of coal in the United States are adequate for our energy fuel needs for 500 years. if we are prepared to spend the funds to develop the technology necessary to coals full utilization. Such a policy would render the United States impervious to any threat of energy fuel blackmail. from any quarter. I believe. in the light of developments in the Middle East. that a national fuels policy. with an accent on coal research. is one of this Nations top priorities. and that steps should be taken immediately to implement such a policy.",

The Vice President should have appropriate accommodations where he Is readily accessible to the center of activity of our Federal Government and where he can be properly protected. The need for a VicePresidential home is particularly obvious at this time. Within the last 6 months. the Federal Government has spent more than $140.000 at the home of former Vice President Agnew. These expenditures were made on the personal property of Mr. Agnew and will not inure to the benefit of his successor. Instead. the American taxpayer may again be subjected to underwriting large expenditures at still another VicePresidential residence. Over 7 years ago. we in Congress passed a bill authorizing the construction of a VicePresidential home on the grounds of the Naval Observatory. I strongly urge the prompt appropriation of funds to carry out the provisions of that act or make other suitable arrangements so that the Vice President will be provided with a home suitable to his position and so that the American taxpayer will be spared the expense of hundreds of thousands of dollars on an unlimited number of privately owned homes of Vice Presidents in future years.",

If they get a little more arrogant than they are. and they are already too arrogant. it is just possible that the Congress could repeal that protection and put them under the antitrust legislation. which would in turn destroy their reserve clause capabilities and prevent them from keeping baseball players in peonage and bondage.

This extremely complex and demanding subject has been studied by various groups over decades. Unfortunately. in many of our Nations metropolitan areas we continue to endure unplanned and unstructured growth. which over the remainder of this century will pose a major problem to our viability as a nation. For over a year during 1971 and early 1972. the American Institute of Architects National Policy Task Force studied the problem of urban growth intensively. This study. undertaken by a group of distinguished architects with the help of a variety of expert consultants. explored all espects of our Nations growth policies. In brief. the policies recommended by this task force would change the \"ground rules\" that now shape. and distort the shape. of American communities. These new policies would help create a fresh and useful scale for planning and building in urban areas. and commit the Nation to a major land acquisition policy to guide development in and around key urban centers. These recommendations are of broad scope and will require public debate and discussion. This discussion should begin now. however. for as a Nation we have no time to lose in the fight to save our urban environments from continued unplanned growth. which in the long run can only damage our national spirit and impede our longrange development. Mr. President. I commend this reportA Plan for Urban Growthto every Member of the Senate. and I urge once again that we begin discussing the recommendations contained in the report.

I refer to the over one and a quarter million elderly people who depend on both social security and public assistance payments for their income. They have little or no capacity to absorb the impact of increasing costs and prices. These are the people of our Nation who have a crying need for assistance to make ends meet. to be given in some measure a counterbalance to the inroads already made upon their meager incomes by the everpresent paring knife of inflation. Mr. President. unless a passthrough provision is enacted. many of these elderly people will not receive the benefit of any of the 20percent social security increase voted last year by the Congress. Instead. their oldage assistance payments have been reduced dollar for dollar according to the size of their social security payments. In the absence of legislation along the lines of our bill. the recent social security increase will continue to be used to decrease Statefinanced assistance. Each dollar of the social security increase which decreases a recipients public assistance grant is a dollar that is not going into the pockets of the elderly poor. In the Nation as a whole. there are approximately 1.277.000 people receiving both social security as well as oldage assistance. In California alone. there are approximately 229.000 retired persons receiving such payments. Therefore. the purpose of our bill is to require that an individual receiving both social security and oldage assistance must receive an extra $15 a month or the full amount as a result of the 20percent increasewhichever is less. Thus. the 20percent increase reflected in last Octobers checks will be passed along to recipients and not merely used by the States to reduce other assistance programs. The need for this legislation is urgent. Since October. elderly people have not received full benefit of the increase in social security payments.

Housing and Urban Affairs. and parti2ularly in the Subcommittee on Banking. of which I have been chairman since 1949. As I explained to the chairman. we had eight employees when the reuest was made. We have eight now. We had eight every time except for the 18 months in which we were saving the Government money by letting one person fill two jobs. Let me say to the chairman that I will still be just as frugal as I can. but if the chairman feels he cannot grant that $10.000 now we will most likely be back.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we are all aware that the value of the dollar in international transactions is determined by its relationships to the currenctes of other nations and that the devaluation of the dollar earlier this year lowered its purchasing power with other nations. We are also aware that even though the move was basically a formality. the majority of the Congress agreed and it became a matter of public law September 21. that a new par value be established for the dollar. It seems clear to me that one of the basic reasons for the devaluation of the dollar was to achieve balance in our trade and payments position. yet today we are advocating a raise from last years figure of $1.6 billion to $2.203.000.000 for our fiscal years 1974 contribution to the World Bank and the other three international development lending institutions. I cannot support this legislation since we are going to lose all benefit of revaluation in international trade if we now increase our dollar amounts in all our international dealings. Much of our domestic economic problems stem from our international trade difficulties. I do not believe we should take action now which would tend to negotiate any international trade advantages which we so sorely need. and which have resulted from the devaluation. At a time when our Nation is suffering from a serious balanceofpayments deficit and accumulated debt to foreign nations. I find it unconscionable to allow payments to international development lending institutions to increase. Is the Congress of the United States going to advocate extracting more tax dollars from the American citizens in order to increase U.S. payments in international affairs? At the same time the Congress appears to be advocating just such an action. our State Department is agreeing to the cancellation of a debt of $2 billion worth of rupees owed to the United States by India. not to mention the billions of dollars owed to us by various other nations which we have not and perhaps never will collect. I do not now nor have I ever supported the contribution of large sums of U.S. money to international financial institutions. In light of our Nations present economic condition. I cannot agree to pouring even more U.S. dollars into the international market. I urge my colleagues to vote against this attempt to increase the U.S. payment.",

I find it most interesting that we are here today to discuss funding of a legislative proposal which must out of necessity include the level of funding. and yet we are told that we have no alternative but to accept the committees report at its level of spending. The rationale behind this reasoning seems based upon the assumption that we have made certain international commitments which must be honored regardless of any commitments or responsibility to the American people or the A merican taxpayer. I feel that it might even be safe to say at this point that many Members would not have voted for the original authorization bill if they had realized that in addition to gutting 10 cents out of every Americans dollar. they would also have to approve another $2.2 billion that we do not have to reward the international bankers who manipulated the devaluation in the first place. There most certainly is an alternative to this taxpayer clipping measure. A Member can certainly cast his vote against the entire bill. If we had no alternative. then why is the matter even being debated and why is it necessary to have a vote? I hope that we are not international rubberstampers yet. As far as concern over international banking commitments and saving face with a bunch of international bankers and foreign politicians. I can only say that I could not care less. My prime concern is that we start saving face with the American people. who must by now have realized that something is wrong with their money. It is not just that prices are going up. but rather that the buying power of their dollar is going down. I am far more interested in what the American people think of us. rather than allow a bunch of international spendthrifts to think that they can continue to gouge us to fund their playhouses. I was against this legislation when it originated. and all the talk today has done is convince me that I was correct.

Mr. Chairman. we are now in no better position to take a determined step forward in our responsible conduct of foreign relations. The overall outlay we are proposing is put at $477 million. that amount to be paid out over an estimated 12year span. The budgetary impact for this coming year will be approximately $12 million. This. I think. is a small price to pay when one considers the overwhelming good it will have on peoples lives throughout the disadvantaged portions of the globe. I urge my colleagues to join me in the swift passage of this resolution so that America may be able to maintain its fair share of the development programs funded through these multilateral development banks. Congress passed a devaluation of the dollarthey had an opportunity to vote it down but they saw fit to pass it. All we are asking here is that the United States not welsh on their commitments. You cannot on the one hand devaluate the dollar and on the other hand make up the shortfall caused by this devaluation. As one who has been actively involved In the seeking of adequate funding for this Nations foreign aid program I must lend my full support behind the intent of this par value modification appropriation resolution. We are dealing here with a legal commitment. an authorization signed by the President not more than 2 weeks ago which instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain the value of the U.S. dollar now being held in multilateral development banks. The crucial importance of the function that these institutions perform was spelled out graphically in a recent news editorial. and I quote: They have become essential to the process of transferring capital and technology to the countries least able to generate these resources on their own. Adequate participation in the work of these banks has become. in turn. essential to the world standing of the United States. This has very little to do with the old and simplistic cold war notion of winning friends and influencing people abroad. It has a great deal to do with creating the mutual confidence in international relations which is required in a time of d6tente.",

We feel that $447.000.000 is the total new obligational authority which should be created at this time. This figure represents the highest amount that the testimony shows can be called for. not only during this fiscal year. but between now and 1986.

If they ask for $12 million. I do not believe it is necessary for us to create new obligational authority of $2.203 million. For the fiscal year the testimony is that only $12 million will be required. and the testimony is further that between now and 1986 the maximum drawdown on this new obligational authority would be $477 million. Therefore. I believe the House in its wisdom would be following the course of prudence and certainly the course of financial responsibility to appropriate the amount of $477 million. with the understanding that if they need more they can come back and the House will probably exercise its usual generosity in appropriating what is needed.",

We are recommending in the bill $70.500.000 as an additional appropriation for emergency disaster reliefthe budget request was $25.000.000. so our request Is $45.000.000 above the budget request to replenish the depleted emergency fund. And. may I say. this request was made several weeks ago. and it is evident to the committee that recent floods In the Lower Mississippi Valley have caused extensive damagebut due to the magnitude of the disaster. it will be some time before an accurate assessment of damages can be made.

I intend to offer an amendment which will explicitly deal with the question of U.S. combat forces fighting in Cambodia. I feel that the Addabbo amendment deals with this implicitly. and I believe it should be dealt with explicitly. My amendment. which will be read at that time. says: Provided that none of the funds herein authorized to be transferred by such Section 735 by the Department of Defense shall be expended to support directly or indirectly combat activities in. over or from off the shores of Cambodia by United States forces. I feel this sharpens up the effect of the Addabbo amendment. My amendment will constitute a clear message from the Congress to the President that all bombing in Cambodia must stop. This will bring to an end this business that somehow our fighting in Southeast Asia has been justified by appropriations. My amendment. I believe. will be a somewhat more precise instrument and will give greater precision to and sharpen up somewhat the impact of the Addabbo amendment. I therefore plan to offer it at that time. I might point out that my amendment would not prevent our continued aid in the form of weapons or economic support for the nonCommunist Cambodians. It would merely forbid the use of U.S. combat forces. That was the whole intent. we all thought. of the treaty Mr. Kissinger worked out. that Is. there would be no more U.S. combat troops fighting and dying. but we would still be helping with weapons and economic aid to our allies over there. We have tried. I believe. to adhere to the letter of this In South Vietnam. but in Cambodia we are violating it. It Is our job here as the Congress to tell the President he is no longer authorized.

That position was reached before coming to the House. when our national leadership proclaimed that we were not going to win the Vietnam war and that we were not there to win. My votes today on the Addabbo and other amendments to the Second Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1973 should not be interpreted as a deviation from that position of opposition to a war we should have never entered or continued. In the first place. it is clear from the testimony before the Appropriations Committee and the debate here this afternoon that passage of the amendments will not stop the President from continuing the bombing in Cambodia. The requested transfer of funds is not necessary for the bombing to continue. Second. and perhaps more importantly. the American Presidency is in a sad state of repair before the eyes of the world. The office of the President is sinking in the abysmal mire of the Watergate burglary and the extensive political espionage. sabotage. and camouflage surrounding it. The President and his assistant. Dr. Kissinger. will be in a few days attempting to negotiate the rest of our forces out of Cambodia and Southeast Asia.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I am deeply concerned that those sections of H.R. 7447 providing funds for the District of Columbia may establish a questionable relationship between revenue sharing funds and the Federal payment to this city. This 1973 supplemental appropriations bill excludes $8.5 million in an authorized Federal payment to the District and requires instead that the city use revenue sharing funds which had been allocated to meet costs in the next fiscal year. Historical records indicate that a specific Federal payment has been provided to the District of Columbia since the 1870s. The purpose of this payment is to cover those costs which the city accrues as a result of providing city services such as police and fire protection to the Federal Government. The payment in part also compensates the city for lost revenues due to the taxexempt status of Federal property. Currently. 55 percent of all property in the District is taxexempt. The Federal payment is thus a specific allocation designed to pay the Governments appropriate share of the costs of operating the District. Under the Fiscal Assistance to States and Local Government Act passed by Congress last year. the District of Columbia receives a revenue sharing allotment of $24 million annually. As the legislative history behind this act shows. revenue sharing was not intended as a substitute for other forms of financial assistance. In fact. the act in section 107(b) specifically prohibits States from reducing payments to local jurisdictions because these jurisdictions receive revenue sharing. The District of Columbia is the only jurisdiction in which revenue sharing funds are appropriated by Congress. If these funds can be used to reduce the Federal payments. this precedent ignores both the congressional intent behind the revenue sharing act and the special nature of the Federal payment. This becomes particularly critical if other special revenue sharing measures are adopted. I. therefore. urge that this matter be reexamined in light of both the congressional intent and fiscal soundness of this action.",

Now. recognizing. of course. that the Committee on Rules may waive points of order based solely on rule XXI. clause 2 so as to. in effort. eliminate the necessity of separate positive policy making legislation in the ordinary case. the Committee on Rules may not waive a constitutionally mandated procedural requirement for the making of war. and that requirement is inextricably linked with rule XXI. clause 2. and there is no way that they can be separated. I am not arguing here that ultimately a court would decide the legislation is unconstitutional. I am not arguing the substantive constitutional point.

Ind.. in the 1870s. has always been somewhat uncertain. Some say it stemmed from a group of men who met and decided to petition the Vandalia Railroad for a stop there. The superintendent of the railroad was Benjamin Davis. who obligingly suggested that a loading platform be built adjoining the tracks and in the center of the community. When the work was completed. a name was needed for the Vandalia timetable. and somebody suggested it be named after the generous superintendent. Perhaps no Indiana community has undergone greater changes than Ben Davis. And perhaps the most outstanding feature of the Ben Davis development has been in the school system. And most certainly one of the most prodigious offspring of this school system has been the Ben Davis High School Band. The 197374 Ben Davis High School Band. under the capable direction of Mr. Raymond S. Cox. has 327 members.

FRANCE.-Turkeys 1971 ban on opium poppy cultivation led to spectacular \"upheavals\" in illicit drug traffic throughout the world. according to a report submitted to the annual assembly of the International Police Organization opening here today. The report by Interpol SecretaryGeneral Jean Nepotte described the Turkish ban. which ended several weeks ago. as \"the most important single event affecting the illicit traffic in opium and its derivatives.\" It said the ban led to a worldwide heroin shortage and to \"dramatic price increases.\" particularly in the United States. The report covered the year 1973. the first year in which the effects of the ban were felt throughout the international illicit drug trade. \"The lack of availability of Turkish opium. coupled with reinforced law enforcement activity in particular in France and the United States. seriously disrupted the traditional trafficking from Turkey through clandestine laboratories in Southern France and onward by a variety of routes to North America.\" the report said. \"The laboratories found themselves without the necessary provisions to produce heroin and at the same time the arrest of some very important traffickers virtually brought an end to what had been until 1973 one of the most important trafficking activities in heroin in the world.\" The report did not refer to the Turkish governments recent decision to lift the ban. but the implication was that the renewed cultivation of opium in Turkey could bring large new supplies of illegal morphine and heroin on the European and North American markets.",

He has visited me in my office on several occasions. voicing his concern about military manpower and training. And when testifying before the Armed Services Committee he always commanded respect and adoration by all the members. In Vietnam he performed brilliantly. always thinking of the welfare of the individual soldier and all others engaged in combat. For his service there this Nation is everlastingly indebted. To Mrs. Abrams and other members of the family I extend my profound sympathy in their bereavement.",

Graft. it is estimated. adds about 1 cent or more directly to the retail price of each pound of meat sold in the city. and indirectly much more than that. amounting to losses of millions of dollars to shoppers. Federal. State and local investigations over a 3year period have produced 16 indictments of local racketeers. butchers union officials. meat brokers. and supermarket and meat company executives. One case before the New York Supreme Court which recently closed and is awaiting a decision in October charges that officials of the worlds largest beef packer. Iowa Beef Processors.

Under indictment for income tax evasion are the president. secretarytreasurer. and director of organization of the Greater New York local .f the Amalgamated Meat Cutters Union. Federal tax indictments include supermarket executives. who. over a 2to fouryear period. failed to report complete taxable incomes. A key figure in this whole affair is Moe Steinman. vice president of a supermarket chain. who is now under State indictment for conspiring to commit bribery and for alleged Federal tax violations. According to court testimony. Mr. Steinman was the man to see in the meat business in New York City which advice the Iowa Beef people followed to their subsequent sorrow. His power came from his connection with corrupt labor union officials. Businessmen were forced to go along or suffer the consequences. Although the full story has yet to be told.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I yield myself 3 minutes on this amendment. to begin with. Let me point out that the Federal Salary Act of 1967 created a very fine Commission on Executive. Legislative. and Judicial Salaries. The Post Office and Civil Service Committee has worked very hard in trying to make this a workable system. there is now being considered in the House S. 1989. which was passed by the Senate this year. to change this commissions period for recommendations from a 4year to a 2year period. What we are talking about is not just the salaries of Congress. f.abinet officers. and the judiciary. we are talking about every person employed in the Federal Government who is above the fourth step of grade 16. The compression that is in effect today for executive salaries and those who work for the judiciary and those who work for Congress is set by our salary level. This amendment provides that our salary increases. if there are to be any. shall not exceed the guidelines set so long as there are wage and price controls. Again. let me point out. as was pointed out in the committee. in the past 4 years. from 1969 through 1972. the average union journeyman and the average 22 construction crafts received a 42.2percent increase in salary. Those in grade 16 and above have received an increase of 19.5 percent. because of the compression involved by our salary level. So we are not talking about just how much we make as Members of Congress. we are talking about how much is paid to employees in grades 16. 17. and 18. the five executive levels. and those in Congress. but for the executive and the judiciary. and the executive branches below the Cabinet level. I feel we should not interfere with the Salary Act of 1967. Unfortunately. the Senator from Alabamas amendment emasculates the 1967 act. because it makes it completely unworkable. It says it takes an act of Congress to put into effect any salary increase recommended by the Commission not only for the Congress. but for the Executive and the judiciary. After setting up a system that works. why should we. in a nongermane amendment. destroy the system established in 1967? So far as I am concerned. as a member of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. the system has worked. Why destroy it?",

Mr. President. the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Alaska would change the entire concept of the original amendment seeking to freeze the salaries of Members of Congress. the Federal Judiciary. and members of the Presidents Cabinet at their present level. The amendment is an enactment of the Congress. whereas the substitute. which is different from the amendments that we voted on already. which have merely added amendments to the original amendment. would wipe out the Pastore amendment. the Jackson amendment. and the original amendment that was offered. When we got through. we would have absolutely nothing. because it says it is the sense of our Congress that Members of Congress and the judiciary and the Presidents Cabinet shall be put on the same basis as employees throughout the land. Mr. President. this would end up with absolutely nothing. because the approaching pay raise would come on just the same. There would be no regard to this amendment of the Senator from Alaska whatever. because it does not purport to limit anybody. It just says it is the sense of Congress to put them under the same wage guidelines applicable to other employees. It is belittling to the Senate. it is belittling to the House of Representatives. that we be called upon to enact a sense of the Senate or sense of Congress resolution in this fashion. When the smoke had cleared away. we would have a complete nullity that would not be worth anything whatsoever. So if Senators want to kill the original amendmentI think the amendments that have been tacked on have done serious damage. they have not killed it. because the amendment is still therethis substitute would in effect be a vote against the original amendment and would say to the Salary Commission. \"Come on with your pay raises.\" It would say to the President. \"Come on with the setting of the compensation for the Members of Congress.\" which is granting still more power to the Executive. and we complain about that all the time. So if Senators want to kill the salary freeze for Members of Congress. vote for the amendment now pending. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts the remainder of my time.",

Just the other 6 .y I happened to be presiding over the Senate when the war powers bill was being considered. and. in addition to the Presiding Officer at the time. there were 3 Senators on the floor debating that important issue. I recall on many of the endthewar amendments an attendance of four or five or six Members of the Senate was a pretty good turnout. We pass multibilliondollar bills here with some four or five Senators on the floor when the vote starts. But this afternoon we have had a regular attendance here on the floor of about 75 Senators all the time. and I think it is very commendable that Senators have been present for the consideration of this important legislation. I must say that I regretted the little inconsistency that I was guilty of in voting against the amendment which I and some 37 other Senators introduced. because the entire nature of the amendment had been changed. The original amendment sought by legislation to freeze the salaries of Members of Congress and the Federal judiciary and the Presidents Cabinet to their present level. whereas the amendment that was finally voted on was the original amendment as substituted by the Stevens amendment. and it provided something entirely different. It was not legislation. it was merely a sense of the Senate resolution. which leaves the salary commission free to recommend any wage or any salary increase that it sees fit. So. Mr. President. it was for that reasonand I noticed that pretty nearly all or most of the original sponsors of the amendment voted the same wayI was compelled to vote against the amendment as a substitute. because it calls for a salary raise in some amountI do not suppose anybody knows just how muchwhereas the original amendment sought to freeze the amount of compensation at the present level.

I and a group of my colleagues went to the chairman.

We were pleased that the chairmen agreed to holding hearings by the Senate Rules Committee in September. In requesting hearings. the group stated that they felt public financing was the logical next step to take in the area of campaign reform. but agreed that consideration of any public financing plan should not come to the floor of the Senate until after hearings had been completed. I strongly support this position. The place to design a workable publi& financing plan is not on the floor of the Senate in the middle of debate on campaign reform amendments.

Miami Herald which I will include as a part of my remarks details international efforts to secure Mr. Lunts release in exchange for a Cuban soldier held captive by the Government of Portugal. The release of Mr. Lunt upon the concurrent release of Cuban Capt. Rodriguez Peralta was the Cuban Governments own proposal. It does not involve an obligation by the United States but it does involve a Cuban commitment to the Vatican and to Mr. Lunts family. I hope all of those who would have us believe that the time has come to change our policy toward Cuba will take note of this case and of the coldhearted way in which the Cuban Government continues to intentionally shatter the dreams and the lives of one small American family. It is my hope that the Cuban Government will reexamine the commitments which they have made and decide to honor them and allow Mr. Lunt to rejoin his family. The referredto article follows: [From the Miami Herald. July 12. 1974]",

In this age of individual dependence on Government it is vital that these rights be scrupulously protected against Government abuse. Just because the Federal Government provides public schools. does that mean it has the right to expel public school students en masse? Of course not. But there are many less obvious realms of governmental power in which individual liberties can be overwhelmed by dependence on Government largesse. Public licensing is such a realm. What rights does an applicant have in the face of his need for a license from the local or Federal Government? The New York Legislature recently acted to protect the rights of individual applicants for licenses. This new law protects from discrimination those who have been arrested but not convicted. I insert in the RECORD a WINS radio editorial describing the law. I urge my colleagues to study the law as a standard for securing the civil rights of individuals who are dependent on the Government.

The fact. of course. is that the Government and its deficit spending got us into the mess in the first place. so I am not very optimistic about the Government pulling us out of the fire. I believe that in the final analysis the solution to our Inflation crisis will come from our own free enterprise system. If we will simply cut the Federal red tape that burdens our free enterprise system we would go a long way toward putting our economy back on track. Mr. Speaker. one of the reasons that our free enterprise system works so well is the fact that our small businessman is one of the most productive and efficient forces in our economy. The small businessman is a great national resource. and it is one of which we can all be proud. I am sure that many Members could cite examples of businesses that excel. but I am proud of the fact that my own First Congressional District boasts one of the finest. I am referring.to the Robbins Packing Co. in Statesboro. Ga. This year the Robbins Co. is celebrating its 25th anniversary. The firm was founded by Charles M. Robbins. Sr.. on September 17. 1949. Charles M. Robbins. Jr.. and Lewis W. Hook joined the company soon thereafter. In continuing its pattern of growth. Robbins was incorporated in 1957. Extensive plant construction in 1965 and 1971 has permitted continued growth. Today. Robbins employs 75 individuals and contributes more than $2 million to the local economy in livestock purchases alone. Mr. Speaker. I am delighted that Robbins Is a member of the fine business community in my district. and I congratulate them for their Industry and hard work over the years. Their fine spirit and activity as a good neighbor in our community reflects well upon themselves and all Americans.",

Neither the threat. nor the recognition that the danger exists. Is new. Sixtysix years ago President Theodore Roosevelt spoke before the Conference on the Conservation of Natural Resources. I would like to share some of his words with you today: We have become rich because of the lavish use of our natural resources. and we have just reason to be proud of our growth. But the time has come to inquire seriously what will happen when our forests are gone. when the coal. the iron. the oil and the gas are exhausted. when the soil has been further impoverished and washed into the streams. polluting the rivers. denuding the fields and obstructing navigation. These questions do not only relate to the next generation. It is time for us now as a Nation to exercise the same reasonable foresight in dealing with our great natural resources that would be shown by any prudent man in conserving and wisely using the property which contains the assurance of well being for himself and his children. As Americans. we have certain unalienable rights. but we also have \"unalienable responsibilities.\" One of these is to protect. conserve and restore our natural resources.",

The June 23. 1972. transcript clearly demonstrates that he knew of the breakin into Democratic Party headquarters long before the March 21. 1973 date he previously stated. and worse. that he was personally involved in the coverup and misused the FBI and CIA for these purposes. On the basis of his own admission of August 5. 1974. and my examination of all the evidence. I have arrived at the unhappy judgment that the President is guilty of obstruction of justice under article I of the charges leveled by the House Committee on the Judiciary. In addition. the new evidence made available August 5 may well cause me to vote \"aye\" on article II which charges that the President misused his power. The most important aspect of our entire system of government is equal justice under the lawthe principle that no personwhether he be rich or poor. black or white. ordinary citizen or Presidentis above the law.

Copper is one of the commodities considered by the Cost of Living Council as being eligible as a volatile commodity so that the companies are exempt from the prenotification requirements.

Then in the third paragraph we find this statement: In the meantime there Is a current worldwide shortage of copper and the supply picture is showing a further tightening.

Then in the third paragraph from the bottom we find this: Domestic consumption of all forms of copper amounted to 2.019.500 short tons in 1971. and 2.220.100 short tons in 1972. In 1971 the U.S. produced about 1.809.000 short tons of primary copper. The primary import sources in 1972 were Canada 66%. Chile 14%. Yugoslavia 13%. Mexico 4% and other countries 3%. It was my understanding that these laws were passed for the purpose of putting our military in a position of not being embarrassed by shortages.

In this bill there will be no amount of copper retained in the national stockpile at all. All the copper in the national stockpile is authorized to be disposed of by this bill. Oh. 7.000 tons of copper alloy will be retained but that metal is usable only for special purposes.

In addition to significant supply shortages created by problems in major producing countries such as Chile and Zambia. the price freeze was driving important U.S. supplies of brass and copperbearing scrap abroad. I understand pressure was put on the U.S. Government to embargo exporting of copper. but apparently the Government did not do it. It should have done so to provide balance to the price support program. The price controls were put on to keep the price of copper at a reasonable level in this country. There was an opening at the other end of the economic scale. which permitted copper to go to markets abroad for higher prices. The point is with the sale from the stockpile of copper. there are still no export controls which will stop the shipping and selling of copper to other countries. I wonder whether what we are doing in passing these bills will really take care of the situation. Again. I allude to what my friend. the gentleman from Colorado . said.

I also oppose other bills similar to it which we are considering todayinvolving the sale of the Governments stockpiles of aluminum. zinc. silicon carbide. molybdenum. and opium. The only rationale behind such depletion of our copper reserves is that the sale may help stabilize rising copper prices in this country. On examination. however. this justification falls fiat on its face since members of the Armed Forces Committee have admitted that the sale of these copper stockpiles will have only a marginal impact on the price of copper in this country. On the other hand. the reasons against completely depleting our copper stockpiles are weighty and compelling. The first reason is one of military preparedness. In the event of a war our Government will have none of its own copper reserves and we may be caught short of adequate supplies for military defense. Second. the Government may have to utilize these existing stockpiles to help alleviate more serious copper shortages in the future. We should have learned this frcm our experience with the socalled grain deal. in which for the purposes of detente we sold all our grain reserves forgetting that those reserves might have been crucialas they later turned out to bein helping to prevent the extraordinary inflation in food prices. We cannot foresee at the present time for what future crisis these copper reserves may be needed. but since selling them now will serve no necessary purpose. we ought to preserve them. Accordingy. I cannot support the sale of all of our Governments copper stockpiles or the sale of our other mineral reserves which would serve only to make us more vulnerable now and in the future.",

I would observe that some persons uttering this cry are wellmeaning and sincere. others are mounting sheer sloppy demagoguery. Mr. Speaker. all cries are premature and not well founded. Article II. section 4 of the Constitution states: The President. Vice President. and all civil Officers of the United States. shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for. and Conviction of. Treason. Bribery. or other high crimes and Misdemeanors. What are these high crimes and misdemeanors committed by President Nixon? I find it rather amazing that anyone could demand the impeachment of the President of the United Statesthe most extreme action the Congress could take and which has never happened to a President in our historysimply because he fired an employee of the executive branch which he appointed. Nowhere in the Constitution of the United States do I find such action listed as an impeachable offense. It may not have been good Judgment. but it is certainly no crime. If the firing of ones employee. in this case Mr. Cox. is a high crime of misdemeanor. then I say that there has not lived a President who should not have been impeached. Is the Presidents high crime or misdemeanor that he is defying the courts? I think not. Less than 1 hour ago the Acting Attorney General of the United States relayed the word that talks were underway and that negotiations were being considered to resolve the tapes conflict. I predict that if the courts order President Nixon to produce the tapes he will comply. Mr. Speaker. the President of the United States has been charged with no crime. and he has committed no crime.

President Nixon has demanded that Watergate be tried in the courts. This is exactly what Watergate Prosecutor Cox was attempting to do when fired by the President. The resignations and firing which were brought about by Mr. Nixon represent a 180degree turn in his commitment to the Congress and the American people to have a thorough. full. and impartial investigation Into the Watergate incident and its subsequent coverup effort. Actually. when President Nixon appointed Elliot Richardson as Attorney General. William Ruckelshaus as Deputy Attorney General. and Richardson appointed Archibald Cox as Watergate Prosecutor. Mr. Nixon was selecting his own people and repeatedly announced that he had complete confidence in their integrity and character. Due to this abrupt reversal on the Dart of the President. I am willing to participate in the debate of possible impeachment proceedings. However. I must make clear my total opposition to any impeachment of the President prior to the confirmation by the House and Senate of GERALD FORD as Vice President.

As the head of the executive branch. the President has the power and the right to fire any appointees in his administration. Firing a subordinate is certainly not an impeachable offense. Defiance of a court order. however. is another matter and herein lies the constitutional dilemna confronting us. The separation of powers between the three branches of the Federal Government is the cornerstone of our system of government. Can one branch compel the other to do something which the other branch feels contravenes the separation of powers? That is the constitutional crisis facing us. How we resolve it could have ramifications for succeeding centuries. The solution of this issue is more important than the personality of Richard M. Nixon or the Nixon administration. The consequences are historic and that is why it is so imperative that we be statesmanlike rather than partisan in our deliberations and judicious in our statements. The Congress has a paramount responsibility before us which takes precedence over impeachment resolutions and all else: that is the prompt confirmation of the Presidents nominee for Vice President.

Extends the food stamp program to cover items used for personal hygiene. that is. toilet paper. soap for personal use. laundry aids. toothpaste. et cetera. Second. Creates coupons representing denominations of less than 50 cents that will be distributed by approved food stores in order to eliminate the use of nontransferable change slips. Third. Requires that monthly food stamps allotments be based on the U.S. Department of Agricultures moderate cost food plan and that no household be required to spend more than 20 percent of its Income as its purchase requirement for food stamps. Fourth. Allow issuance of food stamps to an elderly or disabled person regardless of whether he has cooking facilities. My office can make available on a loan basis a copy of a nutrious menu plan for an individual without cooking facilities. Fifth. Requires a quarterly updating of the food stamp allotments and use of the most recent quarters statistics in computing the allotment updates so that the benefits can keep pace with our record rate of inflation. Sixth. Changes the name of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 to the \"Adequate Nutrition and Basic Hygiene Act.\" The changes proposed by this legislation are far reaching and create a comprehensive program that will insure adequate nutrition for all Americans. This is a worthy goal and I hope my colleagues will support this legislation. The text of H.R. 15088 follows: H.R. 15088 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That section 2 of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 (7 U.S.C. 2011) is amended to read as follows:",

The traditional concept of a private home surrounded by lawn and hedges is being undermined by the economic realities of the 1970s. The first evidence in this adjustment to the financial climate was the proliferation of mobile homes. the second clue is the dramatic rise in condominiums. There has. however. been an increase in the possibility of economic and physical pitfalls which has accompanied the dramatic increase in condominium purchase. The young. middleincome couple. who can no longer afford a small home. is Increasingly looking to the condominiumand they are finding that there are several ways to run afoul.

His name is Dr. Marvin Stark. professor of operative dentistry and oral biology at the University of California School of Dentistry. On June 1. 1970. I submitted for publication in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an article describing Dr. Starks successful provision of dental care to underprivileged California children in rolling clinics fashioned out of converted buses. It is not surprising to learn that Dr. Stark was not satisfied with establishing his mobile clinics as an ongoing program just in California. Over the years. as a result of persistent effort. Dr. Stark has traveled with his dental buses to Mexico. Israel and Greece. Soon needy children in Yugoslavia and Kenya will benefit from the friendly drills of Dr. Stark. his colleagues. and studentsall of whom donate their time. and pay their own transportation expenses. An article prepared for the California Today section of the San Jose Mercury by Mary Gottschalk captures the warmth and understanding of Dr. Starks program.

Stark. a Los Altos dentist is one of those people who finds a way. Dr. Stark very much believes that the future of the world depends on the welfare and happiness of children. In his own way. with the help of faculty colleagues and students at the University of California. San Francisco. Dr. Stark has been eliminating needless pain in children in California and overseas for several years. Dr. Starks way is with a busa mobile dental clinic complete with four treatment chairs. the latest equipment for providing complete dental treatment. an auxiliary unit for xray equipment and a laboratory. Since 1968 mobile clinics have been traveling the dusty trails of the migrant farm workers. stopping wherever they did to give aid to their children. In 1971 the program was expanded overseas to Israel and then to Greece the following summer. This year it will expand even more to Yugoslavia and Kenya. A Childs visit to one of the mobile clinics is frequently also his first visit to a dentist.

Organized labors top economist. Mr. Nathaniel Goldfinger. recently warned that the projected conceptual change would have a direct and chaotic effect on 5 million workers whose wages are tied directly to the CPI. Several million others would be indirectly hit because the index is a factor in contract negotiations and collective bargaining. The present Consumer Price Index. operating since World War I. is based on the buying patterns of the average American. The Nixon plan is to add the high salaried selfemployed professional. executive. and others equally unrepresentative of the national norm as far as purchasing power is concerned. This radical change would distort the picture of the cost of living facing the American worker. If the new formula had been In effect over the last 3 years it Is highly probable that the rate of inflation would have been substantially understated. Modernizing the Consumer Price Index Is a laudable object but any update done must not change the basic concept of the index. which is exactly what the projected administration plan would do. I join with Mr. Goldflnger in the view that should Nixon continue his campaign for a new CPI. it would raise serious questions as to whether or not the administration is not seeking to hide from America the real state of the economy. Juggling statistics is one way of withholding information we are not going to let Mr. Nixon get away with.

The Comprehensive Manpower Act of 1973 provides a worthwhile and needed program that will bring important benefits to the Nation. The bill is the result of a spirit of reason and willingness to compromise. It is worthy of prompt passage by the Congress this year. The bill reported by the conferees is superior to that passed by either the House or Senate. Employment is a critical issue. Because of the energy crisis there are likely to be areas of greater unemployment in the coming year. Provision should be made early. in advance. so we can move quickly with the necessary programs in order to handle any displacement of workers due to energy shortages. I am pleased to note that this bill contains provisions that respond to this need. In addition to the scaleddown public employment plan contained in the present bill. the general provisions of the manpower plan permit the State and local authorities to use other funds provided by the legislation for public employment plans if they see fit to do so. Thus. the people closest to the problem could decide on the best way to use the funds provided to create jobs where needed and thereby reduce temporary unemployment and contribute to the public services provided by the local government. But the real significance of the legislation lies in the future direction of our manpower policies and philosophies concerning job training programs. Having authored manpower legislation of my own earlier this year. I would especially emphasize the benefits of a concept which it contained that has been incorporated in the bill under final consideration today. For the first time. Congress and the administration recognize that if we are to have an effective administration of manpower programs. we must give increased responsibility to officials at the State and local levels of government. and have a flexible program to meet the differing needs throughout the country. There are several other provisions in the Comprehensive Manpower Act that I have long believed would be the means of providing greater service to those who are the intended beneficiaries of our efforts. I will vote for the bill and hope that it will receive an overwhelming vote of approval.",

This body has given careful study and expeditious attention to this legislation. The bill incorporates the primary features of the House bill. It improves upon certain administrative features and strengthens the program through three substantive changes. These substantive changes are: First. The monetary limit on the amount of insurance coverage which can be written has been replaced with a program expiration date of June 30. 1977. In order for insurance to be written after June 30. 1977. congressional oversight and extension of underwriting authority will be required. This is a sound provision which will avoid artificial constraints imposed by undeterminable measures of demand for flood insurance. Second. Deadlines for local acceptance andthe implementation of conditions to be applied in the case of nonparticipationhave been extended. The proposed new dates acknowledge the delays already experienced and make the program implementation schedule more realistic. and Third. Specific procedures are provided to insure participation by private citizens and local officials and to guarantee full review and appeal in the determinations to be made by the Secretary. I consider all of these substantive changes to be in the best interest of the program and urge enactment of the bill.",

With enactment of this legislation. we will have. for the first time. the tools necessary to establish a truly effective national flood disaster protection program. A program which. once the provisions of this legislation are fully implemented. will result in net savings of a substantial amount to the Federal Government. Section 110 of this bill. dealing with appeals from determination of the Federal Insurance Administrator. was the subject of more testimony. discussion. coordination. and committee debate than any other provision in the billboth in this body and in the Senate. I believe that the appeals provisions that finally resulted represent a major accomplishment which. while doing full justice to the legitimate interests of communities and individuals who may feel aggrieved at a particular determination of the Administrator. permits an effective and efficient administration of the flood insurance program. I believe that section 110 is responsive to the major objections that have been raised concerning this legislation. It consolidates the appeals procedures earlier voted on the House floor into a more equitable. comprehensive. and manageable format--one which. while carefully protecting the interests of those affected. avoids the pitfall of permitting those unnecessary delays and selfinterested procrastinations which would make the flood insurance program unworkable. I think that one other provision in this legislation also deserves special mention. Section 208 of the amended legislation permit the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to set interest rates with respect to FHA mobile homes loans at levels needed to meet the current mobile home loan market. As a practical matter. low cost new housingthat is. housing which a lower income family can afford to purchase without subsidy. means a mobile home in todays housing market. Until our housing subsidy programs again become operational. it is essential that credit at affordable rates remain available for the purchase of mobile homes by such families. Section 208 would make this possible. Mr. Speaker. I most strongly urge the prompt enactment of this legislation.",

Rampton of Utah was installed as Chairman of the National Governors Conference. This is just recognition for a man who has served with great distinction as Governor of Utah and whose administration has been a model of integrity and accomplishment. In an editorial on June 8. 1974. the Salt Lake Tribune stated : The honor is obvious to anybody. But to those who have followed Gov. Calvin L. Ramptons career. this latest testimony to his administrative ability and political astuteness Is especially appropriate. As conference chairman Gov. Rampton will have added opportunity to demonstrate his talents on a national scale. He takes office at a time when states seem to be assuming more responsibility. both as a result of current federal policies and of Watergateinflicted federal malaise. Gov. Rampton is the right man at the right time. We are confident that under his administration the governors conference will be revitalized and play an increasingly significant role in restoring public respect for public office. In recent years the National Governors Conference has grown in stature and is now recognized throughout the United States as a strong voice in matters of both local and national concern. During the past year significant legislation has been enacted by many States tinder the direction of the Conference in areas of tax reform. campaign financing and ethics. consumer protection. and sound fiscal management. States have expanded their traditional roles as leaders in creating open government. a trademark of Cal Ramptons philosophy as Governor of Utah. We can expect even greater support for this approach from the National Governors Conference during the coming year. I am confident that Governor Ramptons leadership will stimulate even greater achievements and that the Conference will play an expanding role in matters of public concern. Governor Rampton was elected to his first term in November of 1964. becoming Utahs first Democratic Governor in 16 years. He was reelected in 1968 by the largest margin in the history of our State. In 1972 he was reelected to his current term. surpassing his own record for the biggest victory margin over an opponent. becoming Utahs first thirdterm Governor.

Estonian Americans in the llth District of Illinois. which I proudly represent. and all over the Nation will commemorate the 55th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Estonia. The Intellectual and material renaissance in Estonia during independence. after centuries of medieval czarist rule. was astounding. In only 20 years. the Estonian people. due to the winning of longcoveted national freedom. gained the admiration of the world because of their political. cultural. and economic progress. The mind of the nation appeared suddenly liberated as from some heavy oppression. Systematic research in the domain of science received a strong impetus. The Estonian theater. Estonian music and art all attained a high level. Education received heavy emphasis. National minorities within Estonia were granted the right to organize their schools and education and to develop their national culture through their own freely and democratically elected organizations. Social legislation in Estonia corresponded to modern Western European principles and because of a flourishing economic life. unemployment was nonexistent. Thirtythree years have passed since Estonia was overrun by the Communists and thousands of innocent people were inhumanly exiled. deported. and murdered. The sad fate and memory of these victims are very much alive today. and on the observance of the 55th anniversary of Estonian independence. we pay tribute to their blessed memory. while praying for the freedom of the Estonian people from Communist totalitarian tyranny. We in the free world enjoy all the benefits of political and economic libertyyet how can we fully enjoy our liberties while millions of our fellow men are deprived of the most fundamental human rights? Because we ourselves are free. we have a compelling moral obligation to our brothers trapped behind the Iron Curtain. It seems to me that this obligation lies particularly heavily in our own country. for as a leader in the free world. the United States must help to keep the light of liberty burning brightly in order to remind those who look to the West for inspiration that they are not forgotten.

In fact. the regulations which have been in force since the thalidomide case. may be more damaging to the American peoplethan the less stringent regulations which preceded them.

One year ago. in a speech commemorating the 54th anniversary I expressed the hope that Estonia could celebrate its 55th anniversary as an independent nation. Unfortunately. Estonia rem:Ans a captive nation. On February 24. 1918. 1 day after German troops entered Estonia and drove out the Communists. Estonia declared its independence. Many Estonians fled their Germanoccupied country to publicize to the Allied countries the plight of their fellow citizens. France. Great Britain. and Italy accorded de facto recognition to Estonia in the spring of 1918. In November of 1918. the Germans withdrew. but the Soviets then attacked. The Estonians rallied to the cause of freedom and held off their attackers with the help of the Finns and the British. The Estonians drafted a constitution. relying heavily on the principles in our Constitution. to insure human rights and dignity for all. In the League of Nations. Estonia was often a spokesman for the small. democratic nations. Many Estonians went to Geneva to serve on the staff of the League of Nations. At the outbreak of World War II. the Soviet Union built military bases in Estonia. In June of 1940. the Soviets occupied the country. The people of Estonia were subjected to arrest and exile. About 10 percent of the population was either killed or forced to flee the country. From 1941 to 1944 Estonia was occupied by the Nazis. In 1944. the Soviets reoccupied Estonia. forcing every citizen out of the towns on the Baltic shore so that new settlers from the Soviet Union could move in. Tens of thousands of Estonians were shipped off to other parts of the Soviet Union. The history of terror has not dampened the hopes of the Estonian people that their country may enjoy the freedom which we in this country so often take for granted. Every year Estonians living in the free world celebrate the anniversary of their declaration of independence. Those still living in Estonia cannot celebrate. I hope that someday it will be a real celebration of independence rather than just a celebration of the declaration.",

Prof. Douglas L. Inman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography has explored the causes of this damage in a paper which I will attach at the end of these remarks. Dr. Inman lays at least a part of the blame on the Rodriguez Dam. constructed a few miles away across the border by the Mexican Government. with the formal compliance of the United States. Besides conserving a once ephemeral water supply. the dam also has choked off a flow of sand which formerly could be depended on to replenish the coastline in and around Imperial Beach. It is my feeling that our Government now has a special obligation to help Imperial Beach recover its beach. since the United States was party to the agreement which permitted construction of the dam responsible for the damage. Accordingly. I am preparing a bill which would allow the Army Corps of Engineers to transport fill from a harbor dredging project on the Imperial Beach shore. Since this sand is going to be available anyway. it should be put to the best possible use. Present plans call for the fill to be deposited about 5 miles north of Imperial Beach. on Navy property where it is not really needed and where resulting benefits would be minimal. The relatively modest additional cost of moving the sand to Imperial Beach can and should be assumed by the Federal Government. only in this fashion can the Government restore to the public the recreational area that it has permitted. however unintentionally. to be lost. My bill would authorize the additional funding necessary to carry out the restoration project. Professor Inmans statement follows:",

For the past 2 years the students and faculty of the UCLA School of Dentistry have given their time and skill on a voluntary basis to help the White Mountain Apache Tribe in Whiteriver. Ariz. The purpose of the project is to provide dental services that are not normally available to the Indians through the Public Health Service. The students and their teachers spend from 3 to 10 weeks each summer on the reservation. They are both treating the problems they find at hand and also practicing preventive dentistry by teaching oral health to the schoolage Indian children. On a more longrange basis. they hope to interest the young men and women of the White Mountain Tribe in following careers in dentistry. In 1972 the project involved 84 dental students. 18 professional and student lab technicians. and over 30 professional and student dental hygienists. They served over 400 patients last summer. Over 1.000 teeth were removed and another 1.000 restored. 150 sets of complete dentures were prepared. The efforts of these young professionals in the field of dentistry have made an impressive and most noteworthy contribution to the improved health of their fellow man. I congratulate and commend the students and faculty of the UCLA School of Dentistry for a job well done. I sincerely hope that the Whiteriver dental project will receive wide recognition and continued support from public and private sources.",

What a thrilling and exciting moment it was when the President announced JERRY FORD as his choice. Since that day. JERRY has undergone the closest scrutiny and investigation of his record without parallel in history. Some 300 Federal agents were assigned to the job. On Thursday. December 6. the House debated the nomination for 6 hours. and all Members were given the opportunity on the floor to express their approval or disapproval of the choice. The galleries were filled to capacity all day. Finally. at the end of the long debate the Speaker called for a vote and Mr. FORD was approved by a vote of 387 to 35. On the announcement of the results. pandemonium broke loose. The House and the galleries stood and cheered as the new Vice President entered the hall and ascended the rostrum to acknowledge the cheers.

For a Democratic Congress to impeach and convict a Republican presidentespecially one elected in a landslldeso that a Democrate could assume the nations highest office would be unspeakable. with Mr. FORD no such problem exists. The fear has been cxpressed that impeachment would tear the country apart. That was a convicting line until it became apparent that tt1e Watergate scandal was not about to go away. The continuing scandal is at least as divisive as an impeachment proceeding would be. and impeachment would have an end in sight. Republican insiders are worried that Watergate is likely to be around through the 1974 elections. an orderly. fair impeachment proceeding could easily be over well before next November. Three things should be remembered about impeachment: It is only an indictment. not a conviction. It could clear the President. force him to submit evidence that he would not. for whatever reason. submit voluntarily. It is a process approved by our founding fathers in the Constitution and meant to be used when necessary. We hope that In any impeachment proceeding the President can clear himself.

I do not know whether it Is the energy cnsis or the approaching holiday season. but the demand is reaching the crisis point. There. unfortunately. seems to be little response by the officials here in Washington. While there have been some improvements. not enough is being done. and perhaps too many of their policies are being guided by those associated with the railroad industry at the time their poliy was to discourage and abandon passenger trains throughout the Nation. I have received information indicating that. as of November 30. in the State of Montana alone over 1.000 persons have been unable to obtain confirmed reservations during the period December 15. 1973. to January 4. 1974. The inability of many travelers to ob.tain reservations was the subject of a recent editorial published in the Billings Gazette of Sunday. December 2. The article also points out that during this holiday period Amtrak is planning a reduction in equipment. It is very difficult to understand their reasoning. I think. furthermore. that not only should more trains be on the track to provide more passenger service. but also that we should give the most serious consideration to transporting by rail. once again. the mail which has now been shifted to the airlines an dthe trucking industry. If that Is done. it would compensate for the loss that Amtrak has been undergoing. The time has come for Amtrak to make a sincere and realistic effort to provide passenger train service throughout the Nation. The American public will travel by train if given the opportunity and served by courteous personnel on adequate and upgraded equipment. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that an article. two editorials. and the text of a letter from a Montana constituent outlining his own personal experiences with Amtrak be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

I think the catch is in the word \"available.\" I know that. in Erie. Pa.. and elsewhere. rail equipment for Amtrak and other rail lines is being manufactured as rapidly as possible. But it has long been trueand I suspect it still is truethat the operators of the railroads have not adequately encouraged rail passenger traffic. They had better get on the ball because. in my judgment. this is one of the solutions to the energy crisis. It is a solution to the peoplemoving problem. It is a solution to the glut and congestion of traffic. If we do not have solutions and if we do not pass the bill coming to us shortly for the combination of some of the railroad lines in the Northeast and the Middle West. our problems will multiply. I think we -ought to consider a study with respect to the building and reorganization of the national rail systems in order that we might consider proposing one or two publicly owned rail lines. I do not say that I am committed to that. but I am certainly committed to the review and study of it. rather than to have. ultimately. the nationalization of the railroads. If we do not get better passenger service. the people of the country are more likely to demand nationalized railroads. assuming that we do not move in time to get them a better substitute. . One of the alternatives might well be publicly owned rail systems across the country. I can address myself to the freight projlem at some other time. However. I do think that we have not had the kind of leadership for the railroad industry and the improvement of passenger service. Mr. President.

Most of that problem is created by the nations themselves. not the people. If the people could spend time with each other. perhaps the nations and their leaders could learn from the lasting friendships that would undoubtedly be formed. There is a very special organization. the American Field Service. which is making great strides in this direction. This organization has two programs which bring students from 60 countries to attend secondary schools for a year of study and experience in the United States and sends our children to countries overseas. Foreign students coming here live for a school year with American families and attend local high schools. They have the chance to learn our customs. problems. ideals. interests. and other facets of our lives. In turn they pass similar information on to their hosts. When our young people go to other countries. the program is quite similar. In the past 19 years. some 38.000 students from 76 countries have participated in American Field Service scholarship programs. This private. nonprofit. nonsectarian organization has stated its goal to b the promotion of better understanding between people through international scholarship programs. Mr. Speaker. the AFS has led the way for many years in bringing people from diverse nations together. Through these efforts. communciation will develop that will hopefully one day unite the people of the world in peace and understanding. I join with my colleagues today in saluting the American Field Service and wishing them continued success in their programs. Such programs are unequivocally more fruitful and beneficial to mankind than international misunderstandings brought about by a lack of communication.",

If understanding among the peoples of nations throughout the world. in terms of sensitivity to and appreciation of cultural and historic values. is ever to become a reality. there is no better way I can think of than for young people the world over exchanging their places with counterparts in other lands. Participating in the life of a foreign community and living with an \"adopted\" family abroad will always afford a more meaningful cultural exchange than any possible academic exercise confined to the sterility of book learning alone. The communities and families that sponsor these students are to be commended for their open mindedness and their willingness to learn about our foreign neighbors and to share their unique ideas and values which might otherwise be lost in suspicion. indifference or simple ignorance. Those who would ask how they can individually participate in a worthy cause are to be encouraged in acquainting themselves with the good work of the American Field Service.",

President Nixon. in his June 29. 1973. statement relating to energy needs. does not state explicitly that this Nation faces an \"energy crisis.\" He prefers to call it an \"energy challenge.\" He points to the fact that with 6 percent of the worlds population. we use onethird of the worlds energy output.

Whether or not we have an energy crisis or an energy challenge. certainly we have an energy problem. and a serious one. as everyone will agree. Whenever a serious national problem emerges which requires a Government response. three issues immediately become paramount: policy. organization. and resources.

At a time when the grave economic situation demands fiscal restraint. I am unable to Justify to my constituents the expenditure of more than $63 billion for the military. The House did adopt two excellent amendments which I was pleased to support. The first eliminated a $5.8 million appropriation for the development of a new binary nerve gas program. We already have approximately fifty million pounds of nerve gas in our military stockpiles. We should be working to ban weapons of chemical warfare. rather than inaugurating new and costly programs. The second amendment approved by the House reduced the appropriations for military aid to South Vietnam from $1 billion to $700 million. Americans are no longer being killed in Southeast Asia. but the war continues to rage. fueled by American planes. bombs. guns. and ammunition. Contrary to the repeated assurances of the administration. the United States has not yet gotten out of Vietnam. We remain involved to the tune of billions of dollars in military aid which helps to support the dictatorship of President Thieu. The $300million reduction in the appropriations level imposed by the House yesterday represents an important step in the right direction. Unfortunately. the House failed to make more substantial cuts in the proposed budget. I voted for unsuccessful amendments to delete funding for the obsolete Safeguard missile system and for the dangerous new program of counterforce firststrike weapons development. An amendment to reduce the entire budget by $2.2 billion. which I supported. was rejected by a narrow margin. In its final form. the budget approved by the House last evening provided $83.4 billion to the Department of Defense for fiscal 1975. We in the Congress have been urged to help slow inflation by exercising fiscal restraint. Apparently. the military budget. which represents our largest Federal expenditure. is not subject to this same standard of responsible spending. Increased spending for the military at a time when crucial domestic programs are being curtailed strikes me as a tragic confusion of priorities.

This is a problem which has received much attention and publicity in recent years. and one which has a particularly powerful effect on millions of young people in this Nation. It has been reliably estimated that between 12 and 20 million adolescents and young adults in this country use or have tried marihuana. In other terms. this means that roughly 7 million pounds of marihuana and hashish were consumed in the United States. and all indications point to the fact that this figure is growing daily. It is in light of these startling and alarming statistics that I vigorously believe that this situation merits the serious attention of this Congress in terms of opposing any relaxation of the current marihuana laws. There are many in this Nation who strongly advocate a less punitive law for the marihuana user. maintaining that our present drug policy only breeds further disrespect for the law and thus serves to exacerbate the problem even more. However. this same segment of our population has consistently failed to realize the significance of reports being circulated by scientists and doctors throughout the Nation who have testified to the serious and adverse effects of cannabis smoking. One serious disclosure related to marihuana usage has been the findings that it has the effect of impairing the bodys immunity system. According to noted physiologist and pharmacologist of Columbia University. Dr. Gabriel Nahas. cannabis smoking results in a lower production of white blood cells thereby lessening the bodys important ability to combat disease. In addition. Prof. W.D.M.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 29 years ago yesterday. the United States committed the ultimate act of war. Seeking to end the AmericanJapanese conflict in World War II. it dropped the atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima. As a result of this act. experts estimate that between 80.000 and 200.000 people lost their lives. We would do well to look back and remember Hiroshima. not in a narrow and isolated way. but rather in the larger context of present efforts to halt the nuclear arms race and. hence. avoid future Hiroshimas. The superpowers are presently engaged in efforts to limit nuclear proliferation. If we have learned any lesson from August 6. 1945. it is that these efforts must be successful. Hiroshima must signal not the beginning. but the end of the possibility and realization of nuclear aggression. We should not expect and cannot accept anything less.",

    "speech": "Mr. President the House of Representatives shortly will consider S. 1868. This measure would reimpose the embargo on importation of chrome from Rhodesia. In 1967. the United Nations imposed an embargo on all trade with Rhodesia. and the then President of the United States. President Johnson. unilaterally imposed an embargo on all trade by the United States with Rhodesia. This meant that the United States then became dependent on the Soviet Union for its critical and muchneeded defense materialnamely. chrome. The bulk of the worlds supply of chrome is deposited in Rhodesia. The New York Times in an editorial on Monday. April 8. states that South Africa and Rhodesia have 96 percent of the known chromium reserves. The United States was faced with a very critical situation as a result of President Johnsons unilateral action. In 1971. Congress adopted the socalled Byrd amendment. which would permit the importation of chrome or any other strategic material from Rhodesia if such material was being imported from a Communistdominated country. That is the law today. S. 1868. which is on the House calendar. would repeal this. I think it would be very unwise to repeal that legislation. It would again make the United States dependent on Communist Russia for a vital material. The Member of the Senate who perhaps has the greatest expertise of strategic stockpiling is the distinguished Senator from Nevada . Senator CANNON is chairman of the Stockpiling Subcommittee of the Committee on Armed Services.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last year for the third time in 3 years. the Senate debated the issue of Rhodesian chrome. The issue was the same then as it was the year before and in 1971 when the Congress first adopted the Byrd amendment. which permits the importation of strategic and critical materials from Rhodesia as long as they can also be imported from Communistcontrolledcountries. On December 18. 1973. the Senate passed S. 1868 which would impose the former sanctions and sent it to the House where it was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. That committee favorably reported It out on June 27. 1974 and it now appears on the House calendar for an early vote. The issue is obscure and remote from the lives of most Americans. It is also complex. involving materials which are not produced in the United States or even in all of North America. and involving our relationships with the United Nations. It is an Issue which deserves careful and thoughtful review. My aim today. therefore. is to provide a careful outline of my reasons for continuing to support the Byrd amendment and opposing the enactment of S. 1868. now H.R. 8005. which would repeal it. The principal commodity affected by the Byrd amendment is chrome ore. specifically metallurgical chrome ore. because in Rhodesia are located the free worlds largest deposits of highgrade metallurgical chrome ore. Other types of chrome ore. including chemical grade and refractory grade. are found elsewhere in the world. but the metallurgical grade s by far the most important kind in terms of both economics and national security. The Importance of metallurgical chrome s heightened because the worlds other major sources are the Soviet Union and South Africa. although much smaller quantities are found in Turkey. Iran. and India. Metallurgical chromite in the form of ore as it comes from the mine cannot be employed by the steel industry or by other industrial users. It must first be converted into one of several types of ferrochromium by a hightemperature smelting and reduction process. This process is carried out by the ferroalloys industrywhich also converts manganese ore into various types of ferromanganese and ferrosilicon for use by steel producers and the aluminum industry.",

The President did not go that route. The result was that we ended up with everybody having been increased--except for those who are caught at the top. Inflation is just as real at 30 percent. whatever the level. and its consequences. administratively. are very serious. That Is why it seems inequitable and unjust to impose a freeze at this late stage of the game. after 4 years of allowing this steady costofliving adjustment in all of the private sector. where labor is involved and management is involved and all the governmental sectors except at the top are involved. We were being ridiculous in arguing that this was an inflationary process at this stage. when the total cost of the money allowed here for congressional pay was about $6 million. in a trillion dollar gross national product economy. in a $300 billion budgetary request. It has to be the utter element of the ridiculous to argue this is an inflationary process at this very late hour in the whole complex of our economic problems of the last 2 years.

Director of the Office of Management and Budget. from Mr. J. Fred Buzhardt. who was at that time. general counsel for the Department of Defense. It is quite clear that the Defense Department wishes to take over all of the military assistance. this bill being a part of that effort. One of the purposes is section 7. as to which he says: The probability is good that most of the existing MAP statutory restrictions could be eliminated. In other words. they want no restrictions whatever upon the distribution of funds for military assistance anywhere. This is simply a reversal of the attitude which was expressed by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi last year. in which he said there was no objection to its being concurrent. when the war was over. with the regular military assistance program. I think it is quite clear from this letter what the intention of the Defense Department is. and what the reversal of the attitude of the committee is. I think the Senate ought to know about it. I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. Buzhardt be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

I would remind the Senate that the President originally requested $2 billion. that was reduced to $1.5 billion. The House made it $1.3 billion. The Armed Services Committee cut that to $952 million. So this amount already has been cut. The administration feels it needs much more than the Committee on Armed Services approved. The Secretary of Defense. and I know because I heard him say today. feels exceedingly strongly about this matter. He feels that if South Vietnam is going to survive. the full amount provided by the House should be the minimum. I oppose this amendment because it would signal the North Vietnamese to continue their protracted conflict with enhanced possbilities of success. MASF funding provides the flexibility necessary to oppose or deter further North Vietnamese violations of the ceasefire agreements. The military assistance programMAPis too restrictive to provide the assistance needed in a major active theater like SVN. The administration has recently released intelligence information which plainly shows that the North Vietnamese have continued intensive infiltration of men and war materials to South Vietnam. Laos. and Cambodia since the January 27 Vietnam ceasefire agreement. In addition they have built and refurbished 12 air fields which adds a new and threatening element to the already shaky situation. All this activity is In gross violation of the peace agreements. and further demonstrates Hanois determination to achieve her objectives through military conquest. If our allies in Southeast Asia are to have any chance at all in their efforts to force Hanoi to comply with the Paris agreements. they must have timely and responsive military assistance that they need. A congressional restriction such as the one being proposed. could destroy the credibility of our current stance in Indochina. Some may seek this--but such a move would merely invite Hanoi to exacerbate the situation and to increase the level of tension and of fighting. We all want to disengage from Indochina.

We have already voted on that amendment. That would have wiped IASF out of this bill and made the transfer immediately to the Foreign Relations Committee. This amendment would transfer it in the beginning of fiscal year 1975. The Pentagon told us that they needed 6 months for planning and preparation in order to do this. This is simply providing for an orderly procedure for doing what they told us years ago they intended to do. They said that when the war is over. this can be done. Unless my hearing is bad. we have been told time and time again that we are now at peace with honor and that ther2 is no more war that this country is involved in. We have been told that the war is over. Mr. President. if I am to believe what they said. now is the time for an orderly transition. They stated that they need 6 months to make an orderly transition. This amendment allows them to make the transition at the beginning of the fiscal year 1975. So in January next year. they can have 6 months and be ready to do it. And in the hearings everything can be orderly. As far as the half a billion dollars that this amendment cuts it down to. the real question in the amendment is whether we should continue to spend such large amounts of money for South Vietnamese base support. for transportation. fuel. and so forth. And the $690 million provided for these purposes is simply too high. The evidence in the committee and the evidence given this Senator did not support it. The need is not there for it. In the opinion of this Senator. as the distinguished Senator from Minnesota said. with the $1.200 million in the pipeline. in addition to the authorization. it is not a question of whether we are meeting our commitment. We are meeting it over and over again. This is simply to retain control in the Congress and make the transfer. The amendment should be agreed to.",

Another attempt by the party in power to use the tax laws to further political aims was before the courts yesterday. In 1972. at the request of White House officials for chief Nixon fund raiser. Maurice H. Stans. the IRS issued a very controversial ruling. It permitted big political donors to avoid paying gift taxes on campaign contributions by channeling the money through multiple fundraising committees. Donors got around the $3.000 general exemption for gifts and made it easier to raise funds for political campaigns. Yesterday. Judge June Green of the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia overruled this controversial ruling. But the judges decision is not retroactive.

Education. and Welfare spent $23.000 of the taxpayers money to conduct a study of why children fall off their tricycles. The study concluded that children fall off their tricycles because they lose their balance or they run into objects. It cost the Federal Government $23.000 to learn what every American mother knows. Over a week ago. I asked HEW for an explanation. but I have not yet received a satisfactory response. As we all know. inflation is rampant throughout the Nation. Most sound economists agree that excessive Government spending is one of the major causes of this terrible inflation. We should not allow foolish programs such as this to waste the taxpayers dollars and feed the fires of inflation. There is currently no way Congress can learn of these absurd expenditures before the fact. They can only be uncovered through the audit procedures from the GAO or through an investigative reporter from the news media. Consequently. the only corrective measures are disciplinary actions by the bureaucracy against the individuals responsible for wasteful programs.",

More than 77 percent of the American people believe Congress is doing either a \"poor\" or \"only fair\" job. according to a recent public opinion survey conducted by the Sindlinger firm of Philadelphia. A mere .2 percent thought Congress was doing an \"excellent\" job. The American people are clearly subjecting Congress to close scrutiny. They want their legislative institutions to work better than they have in the past. and they will expect us to work toward that end. In this light. it is shocking that the Democratic Caucus. meeting in secret session on May 9. decided to delay and perhaps even kill the committee reform package reported by the Select Committee on Committees. Reform of our organization and procedure is becoming more necessary with every passing day. and the American people realize this. The action of the Democratic Caucus is not a worthy response to the concern expressed by the public. Mr. Speaker. I think the American people expect us to act promptly. fairly. and publicly on the issue of congressional reform. Therefore I hope that House Resolution 988 will be speedily brought to the floor of the House for full public debate.",

After the American Bakers Association leadership announced to the public that bread would soon be $1 a loaf and that this spring bread shortages would produce lines that would make the customers forget gas lines. we have heard nothing from this organization. At the time. I stated that this was a shameful and factless scare tactic. Since that time. wheat prices have declined almost 50 percent. What has happened to bread prices? They have not declined one penny and in many instances have actually increased. Why? If the earlier comments were not selfserving. I ask the ABA to state their case and make a full explanation to the American consumer. They should explain why a twofold increase should precipitate a threefold increase in bread prices when a similar decline in wheat prices does not produce even a marginal reduction in the price of bread. Without such a followup. I can only question the motivation of these statements and the call for a wheat export embargo. I call upon consumers and producers to draw their own conclusions about the credibility and attitude of the ABA and their high officials toward the two segments of our national food chain which are vital to their survival. Perhaps it is time that the American consumer purchase their own flour and make their own bread. There is no substitute for homebaked bread and pastry for taste and nutrition. Wheat and wheat food products have been referred to as the very staff of life. Bread is one of the four food groups that we need every day. I think it is time that consumers buy their own flour. which has declined about 20 cents on a 10pound bag. and rediscover the taste of what our mothers and grandmothers baked. There is nothing wrong. it seems to me. for some oldfashioned competition to serve the best interests of the American consumer.",

Three months ago. the House passed and sent to the Senate a bill containing a 2year extension from 8 to 10 years. This bill also contained the 13.6percent increase in the subsistence allowance. For 3 months. the Senate has dragged its feet on this bill with the result that today .the rights of 300.000 veterans whose education benefits are due to expire on May 31 have been placed in jeopardy. Now the Senate has sent back to us a bill containing only the 2year extension. There will be an attempt made on the floor here today to substitute the House passed bill for the Senate passed measure. I hope that the House will give grave consideration to this. inasmuch as the benefits of 300.000 Vietnam veterans will end on May 31. and we must remember that if a conference between the House and Senate does not resolve the problem by May 31. the education of 300.000 vets will come to a halt. cutting off hopes for careers and ending job opportunities for many. I might also point out that thousands of veterans are faced with the dilemma of having to register for school before May 31 without the guarantee that GI benefits will be forthcoming. Even a weeks delay in enacting the 2year extension will cause grave problems. Mr. Speaker. I think the Members should be alerted to the fact that the rights of these veterans are in jeopardy today.

I favor the concept of providing greater access to our legal system in this country. By permitting the establishment of joint managementlabor trust funds for prepaid legal services. H.R. 77 is a positive step in this direction. During the course of our hearings. I became convinced that certain safeguards were necessary. Such trust funds should not be used to initiate or carry on proceedings against an employer except in workmens compensation cases or union administering the fund. or any employer or union in matters arising under the National Labor Relations Act. And further. such trust funds should not be used to defend union officials in the socalled HoffaBoyle situation. Therefore. I offered an amendment to deal with these problems in the special subcommittee on labor. This amendment was adopted without dissent. H.R. 77. as now amended. has the support of the Department of Labor and the administration. It also has the support of the American Bar Association. insurance companies. and most consumer groups. An identical bill passed the Senate 3 weeks ago by a vote of 79 to 15. As is apparent from the lopsided nature of the vote. that bill had broadbased. bipartisan support. There is no cost to the Federal Government. The bill. as reported. simply permits the collectivebargaining process to operate freely. And in the final analysis. the joint administration of these plans is a needed protection for employers. Without this bill. employers could be subject to legal harassment from plans unilaterally set up by unions. With passage of H.R. 77. that will not be possible. Mr. Chairman.

H.R. 77 would permit unions to negotiate with employers through collective bargaining a prepaid legal services trust fund which would be jointly administered by labor and management. H.R. 77 costs to the employer would be minimal and the benefits to the worker would be tremendous. The added labor cost would run about 2 cents per manhour or about $38 a year. In terms of tangible benefits for the worker. there is an unlimited range of possibilities. Unions could negotiate programs which would provide for pretrial and trial defense of civil and criminal actions and for the bringing of civil actions in certain consumer situations for their membership.

I want also to congratulate the distinguished ranking minority member of the subcommittee. the gentleman from Ohio for the contributions he has made to the shaping of this legislation. Mr. Chairman. I believe it is important to have in mind as we consider this proposal that at present employers may contribute to funds for legal services for union members but that these employers may not participate in the administration of these funds. It is a central purpose of H.R. 77 to make possible such employeremployee participation in the operation of the jointly administered trust funds. Mr. Chairman. I think it is also important to noteand I say this in view of some correspondence that I have had in this matter. as I am sure other Members have hadthat trust funds established under H.R. 77 cannot be used to initiate legal proceedings that are directed against: first. the employer. his officers or agents except. of course. in workmens compensation cases. or the employer who is a nominal defendant. or second. the labor organization. its parent or subordinate bodies. or its officers or agents. or. third. for the furnishing of legal services where the labor organization would be prohibited otherwise from doing so by the provisions of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. So. Mr. Chairman. it seems to me that. given the increased importance in our country of legal services and effective access to them. given the rise in support for assuring that poor people have effective access to legal services. it ought surely to be possible for labor union members who are not in the category of \"poor\" to be able to contribute to funds which would be jointly administered by themselves and by management to provide the assurance that they will have the services of a lawyer in those situations in which they need them.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. although directed by action of the 92d Congress to build an import quarantine center to import European breeds of cattle and other livestock at Fleming Key off the coast of Florida. the Department of Agriculture has failed to start the plans and design of the facilities. Congress appropriated $300.000 for design and planning in fiscal year 1973. The Department advises me: The design criteria have been completed. Architecturalengineering firms have been evaluated and ranked in order of preference by a review board. Butthe Department then equivocates by saying that they do not intend to expand the $300.000 appropriation for design and planning until construction funds are available. For the current fiscal year appropriations the conference committee of the Agriculture Appropriations Committee asked that the request for funds for the Fleming Key Animal Import Center be made in the routine way through the Presidents budget rather than asking for the funds outside the normal budgetary process. That was not done. Now the Department position is that this quarantine center should be financed through private sources. Whether it is private or Government funds that pay the bill for this needed facility I would strongly urge the Department to get right on the job of design and planning the installation. which usually takes a year. so that when the funds are available construction can start. Further delay only stalls what is an obvious need for the U.S. livestock industry. Also the stall defies the will of Congress in directing that the $300.000 appropriated be used for the purpose of planning and its obvious that the Department has wasted a year or more in defiance of the directive of Congress.",

The situation has not changed at all. The Russians know only one languageonly one language and no other. That language is strength. We must maintain our strength.

This bill gives us the opportunity of holding that strength. although I personally would like to go even beyond the bill in some areas. Consider that our Navy has dropped in the number of ships by hundreds the ships in our Navy are. on the average. far older than the ships in the Russian navy. This is a horrible situation in which we find ourselves. and it is very annoyingwhich is about the only word I can useto hear people strongly cry out for a reduction in our forces when we are doing the best we can to maintain this Nation.

Mr. H]kBERT. No. we are not cutting off any of the flight training. we are also expanding the capability of the Reserve Air Forces by providing additional A7Ds which must go to the National Guard.

But once westarted producing MIRVs. the Soviet Union started to develop MIRVs. We still have an enormous advantage over the Soviets in the development of these weaponsan advance of 5 years or so. But if we are to start a new program of weapons with increased counterforce capabilities. we will only be encouraging the Soviet Union to keep up with us. thereby accelerating the nuclear arms race.

It is a plane that has been developed out of the very odious beginnings of the TFX. The FB111 version is only an interim manned bomber. That is why we have to keep the lines open. For years I fought Secretary McNamara to put a new manned bomber in the air. He insisted that he did not want any. As a result. there has not been a B52 constructed in over 15 years. We cannot have this happen. that the B52 should wear out before the B1 comes along. Then. we would have nothing. All the FIll does is keep that spread open until the B1 becomes a part of the inventory. It cannot come into the inventory until 1981. There are three prototypes in the B1 now.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when the 10th Legislature of the Virgin Islands convened January 8. 1973. it was the first time in 26 years that the legislative branch of the Government of the Virgin Islands could not boast of Earle B. Ottley as one of its members. The legislature. not to mention the people it represents. is certainly much poorer for Senator Ottleys determination to retire. As the primary driving force of the senate. Earle Ottley was responsible for more social legislation beneficial to the people he represented than perhaps any single individual has been in any comparable circumstances. He accomplished this laudable record by virtue of a superb ability as a legislative tactician and a unique grasp of the governing process. The application of these abilities. in conjunction with an unwavering dedication to and compassion for our people. enabled him to achieve so much for our islands. It was my privilege to serve with Earle Ottley for approximately 9 years in the Virgin Islands Senate. For 4 of those years he served as president of the senate while I was minority leader. During all of those years. and especially during that time we served as leaders of opposing parties. I never saw need to question his love for our Virgin Islands and his determination to act in their best interest. Mr. Speaker. the only consolation that we in the Virgin Islands have in the retirement of this great progressive populist leader that it is partial. Earle Ottley is continuing. with his usual breathless energy. his involvement with other responsibilities in the islands. These include. but are not limited to. his chairmanship of the V. I. Commission on Human Resources. the presidency of the V.I. Labor Union. and publishing the CaribPost. a weekly newspaper. Earle B. Ottley. through public office. labor organizing. journalism. and party leadership has been at the vanguard of the struggle to secure an equitable and prosperous Virgin Islands. His current activity promises continued dividends for our peoples rights and welfare. I am now pleased to insert in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a resolution passed by Senator Ottleys colleagues in one of the closing sessions of the Ninth Legislature of the Virgin Islands:",

I underscored two areas of concern. First of all. the oil embargo has been lifted. We are not in the same crisis condition as we were some months ago. It is my understanding from the Congressional Research Service that an increase in the speed limit from 55 to 60 miles an hour would increase gas consumption about 3 percent. It would raise consumption about 8%/3 million gallons. or from slightly more than 290 million gallons a day to about 300 million gallons a day. I also pointed out my very frank and candid visits with people in the State of Kansas who find 55 miles an hour rather difficult to cope with. They think they might be able to accept 60 miles an hour. although. some may be fudging a bit and may be driving 58 or 59 miles an hour. The Senator from Kansas pointed out that this is one of the main contentions of some of the truckers I have visited in discussions about another truck strike. This is one of the issues they have been raising since last December. They say trucks operate more efficiently and effectively around 60 miles an hour. I recognize all the good things that have come from the reduced speed limit. It has brought about a saving in fuel. It has reduced the number of deaths and Injuries on the highway. and I think for that the public should be commended. At the same time. I think we could maintain that safety record and increase fuel consumption by only a small amount by this very modest increase in the speed limit. Mr. President.

Nonetheless. we do have a number of them. and this may very well be entirely deserving. although we are dependent very heavily. as Senator CLARK understands. on the background research he has done. as we have had no hearings. no opportunity from the departments. et cetera. Now. there is a modest amount of money. but still not an appreciable requirement.

It may be so acceptable that hearings and the other steps are not necessary. The Government departments will have a chance to comment.

I believe it should at least be noted in the RECORD that there is objection to this measure by the administration. No one would say that the programs included in this package do not have a great deal of appeal. on a humanitarian basis. Secretary Caspar Weinberger. of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. realizes that. But in a letter to the chairman of the committee. Senator WILLIAMs dated August 12. 1974. the Secretary calls attention to the comprehensive health care proposals now pending before the Congress. He expresses concern about this measure because it singles out certain health programs for special attention without reference to or coordination with the comprehensive health care legislation that we expect to enact. The Secretary indicates concern that this bill would establish separate categorical authorities for some existing programs and adds new programs and categories that were not considered at the time of the hearings. Furthermore. the Secretary believes the authorization for appropriations provided In this bill is excessive and unwarranted. I understand that the cost of this bill. if funded. would be something like $3 billion over a 4year period. Someone at some point in this debate should raise the difficult question of. Where is the money coming from? How does this measure relate to the concern that almost everyone professes today about holding down Federal spending in order to fight inflation? I regret that it is necessary to raise such questions because I realize that this bill and its stated objectives have great appeal. and I ask that the letter from Secretary Weinberger to which reference was made be reprinted in full in the REcORD.

I would just say in response to my good friend and colleague. the Senator from Michigan. the increase in the rate of spending is approximately 20 percent over a 4year period. That is somewhat higher than the general rate of inflation. This is the authorization. certainly not the appropriation. So it is a very. very modest kind of an increase in a number of areas which I think can have important effects in gaining control of the process of inflation. by increasing the areas of supply. I will finally say. Mr. President. this has the support of the Council on the Community Mental Health Centers. the Association for Mental Health. the Association of the National Health Centers. the various organizations which have been most directly affected by these various organizations which have been most directly affected by these various programs all having endorsed the program. I think it is well understood that the administration wanted to cut back on the neighborhood health centers. which are reaching out into the community and providing vitally needed health services for millions of Americans. The administration felt strongly about cutting back on community mental health centers. in spite of the fact that we have only reached approximately 500 of them and the goal was set for 1.500 of them approximately 10 years ago. These are concerns which have been expressed during the course of our consideration in the committee. and I know were also considered by the House of Representatives.

In Tennessee and Arkansas by constitution and in Montana by statute. the maximum interest which may be charged business borrowers is 10 percent whereas the financial institutions must pay up to 13 percent for money bought through the Federal Reserve System in the socalled Federal funds market. Most other States exempt business borrowing from the usury statutes. Although many of the financial institutions in these States have continued to make business loans in anticipation that rates will go down or that the State would take necessary action. they will not be able to continue this practice over a period of time and remain solvent. Hardest hit will be the construction. agricultural and small business firms who cannot channel funds into the States through outside corporate subsidiaries. To give the State legislatures and constitutional conventions sufficient time to act and to avoid unemployment and severe economic repercussions during the interim. on my behalf and the behalf of the Senators from the affected StatesSenators BAKER.

As pointed out in the report of the Senate Committee on Banking. Housing and Urban Affairs (S. Rept. 931120). the current high interest rates impact hardest upon \"construction. agricultural. and small business firms who cannot channel funds into the States through outside corporate subsidiaries.\" Small business investment companiesSBICscannot provide financing for farms. but they do lend to all other types of small businesses. including builders and contractors. and firms which process agricultural commodities. Under regulations promulgated by the Small Business Administration. SBICs may charge a maximum effective interest rate of 15 percent annually. or the maximum under State law. whichever is lower. For this reason. very few SBICs have been formed in those States where the stautory definition of usury is low and where businesses. including corporations. are covered under the usury laws. As concrete examples. of the approximately 330 SBICs in operation today. only 1 SBIC is located in Arkansas. 2 in Montana. and 3 in Tennessee. It is apparent. therefore. that very few SBIC dollars are available to new and small businesses located in those three States. Data collated by the Small Business Administration show that SBICs disbursed over $175 million to some 2.400 small businesses during the year ending March 31. 1973. Of this collective activity. not a single loan was made to an Arkansas firm. only 2 loans totaling about $83.000 were made to small businesses in Montana. and 30 loans for about $1 million went to Tennessee independent businesses. Although industry sources are unable to predict with any certainty the impact of including SBICs within title III of S. 3838. they believe that this moderate. and temporary. liberalization of the Interest rate ceiling would encourage the flow of muchneeded loan funds to small and independent businesses in the three States particularly covered by this legislation.",

Extend the present limitations. placed in the bill to prevent potential conflicts of interest by banks in underwriting and dealing in revenue bonds. to cover bank trading of general obligation municipal bonds as well. Second. Add an additional restriction to those already in title II of S. 3838 which would prohibit banks from making preoffering commitments to purchase either revenue or general obligation issues from a syndicate on terms more favorable than those available to other purchasers. With respect to part 1. above: First. No witness at the Securities Subcommittee hearings could cite demonstrable or widespread bank abuses involving underwriting or dealing in general obligation issues. Hence. there is no need to extend the bills iirohibitions to general obligation issues. Second. If bank abuses are uncovered. S. 2474. the Municipal Securities Act of 1973. establishes a new regulatory structure involving both the SEC and the bank regulatory agencies. which is deaigned specifically to devise and enforce rules applying to all municipal securities activities of banks. S. 2474 is a more appropriate and flexible statute to deal with bank abuses in the general obligation market. With respect to part 2. above: First. The amendment adds a prohibition with a greater impact than any of the five already contained in the bill. It has been pointed out that syndicate bids are based at least to some degree on a syndicate members ability to placeobtain a commitment to purchasebonds in advance of the underwriting. Prohibition of such a practice would hamper bank competition for revenue and general obligation underwriting. thereby reducing potential underwriters for municipal issues and possibly increase their debt service costs. Nonbank dealers would not be affected. Second. Once again. this section of the amendment would extend this prohibition to the general obligation market as well. where there is no showing of need for it and where it might do Immeasurable damage to competition in that market.",

The story says that General Electric has admitted that its nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Morris. Ill.. is \"inoperable.\" According to the story. GEs brandnew. $65 million plant \"may have to be abandoned entirely.\" The trouble with the plant is apparently so fundamental that GE says the only solution would be \"a new process flowsheet and new plant configuration.\" New configuration may be impossible because massive concrete walls. which have been built. are required to shield workers from high levels of radioactivity in the plant. The failure at Morris is another warning to Congress that nuclear engineers and architects can make major mistakes of almost incredible size. This community of experts. nevertheless. is constantly trying to assure the public that nuclear power catastrophes will never happen because not only have they imagined all the possible problems which could cause major accidents. but they have also solvedthose problems for us. That foolish claim is the basic argument of all nuclear power advocatesand it is basically dangerous for this country. The fiasco at Morris is an important reminder that nuclear experts do not imagine and solve all their problems in advance. For all anyone knows.

I would like to make one contemporary observation which perhaps is obvious. but one which future generations should consider in assessing Senator Morse. In the words of the poet Dylan Thomas. Senator Morse did not go gentle into that last good night. He continued to fight for what his conscience led him to believe was right. through victory and defeat. rejecting quiet retirement as a viable option.

One particularly alarming finding was: The grant and contract awards were processed outside normal procedures.

Equally disturbing. there is much concrete evidence that the contract and grant represented a determined effort by officials in the White House to siphon off Federal funds from organizations considered \"unfriendly\" to the administration.

I can only say that the testimony we received from members of the study mission which I dispatched to Chile following an invitation from the junta confirms previous reports by a series of respected international groups. including Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists. of the deplorable condition of basic human rights in that country. Ralph Dungan. former Ambassador to Chile. and Dr. John Plank. a former State Department expert on Latin American affairs. told the subcommittee that on the basis of their interviews of detainees. of defense attorneys for political prisoners. of the families of prisoners. and of respected church and political leaders. they concluded that a systematic use of torture and a continuing pattern of violation of human rights exists in Chile. Their statements. along with the testimony of former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and Judge William Booth of the Criminal Court of New York City. also confirmed that a system of repressive military rule has replaced the traditional democratic and constitutional system in Chile. Despite the strong public and private statements by other governments. the United States has not issued a single official statement condemning the violation of human rights taking place in Chile. There appears to be nothing on the record of an active and vigorous concern evidenced by our representatives. I find this lack of concern for human rightswhich we have seen in the past in Bangladesh. in Vietnam. in South Korea. in Greece. and in other countriesto be a failure of U.S. foreign policy. The most apparent evidence of U.S. policy toward the military government is our continued support of economic and military assistance toward that country.

    "speech": "Mrn. President. several days ago the outgoing Administrator of the Veterans Administration. Mr. Donald Johnson. named Mr. Morris Nooner. Jr. to head the VA Regional Center at Fort Snelling. Minn. Mr. Nooner is currently Director of the Education and Rehabilitation Service at the VA. Prior to coming to the VA in 1971. he was with the Illinois Education Department. In a letter to the President dated July 16. 1974. I strongly objected to the appointment of Mr. Nooner. I believe Mr. Nooner woefully unqualified to assume this important position. As head of the Fort Snelling office. Mr. Nooner will exert important and pervasive control over the lives of Minnesota veterans and veterans throughout the upper Midwest. While he may. as a result of his experience in Illinois and his work since 1971 with the VA. be qualified to deal with the educational aspect of VA work. I can detect nothing in his background or experience which will qualify him for VA field workwork on pensions. home loans. insurance. and other VA programs. Furthermore. Mr. Johnson has recently submitted his resignation. I believe his resignation was motivated by intense pressure from the public and from Members of Congress and by valid criticism of the performance of Mr. Johnson as Administrator of VA. On the eve of his departure. it seems both inappropriate and unwise to permit Mr. Johnson to make this appointment. Given recent criticism of the VA. public confidence and VA performance are not well served by this unfortunate appointment. Yesterday. the Minneapolis Sunday Tribune called upon Mr. Donald Johnson \"to withdraw Nooners appontment.\" In an editorial. the Tribune reviewed the \"bitter bipartisan opposition from the States congressional delegation\" to Mr. Nooners appointment and concluded: The VA in Washington would be wise to reconsider Nooners appointment to what is considered one of the most important and bestrun VA offices in the country. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Minneapolis Sunday Tribune of July 21. 1974 entitled \"An Unwise VA Appointment\" be printed in the RECORD.",

That figure was Wayne Morseseemingly with all the fireas he campaigned only a week ago with those oratorical powers with which he made this Chamber echowhile his contribution to the Nations history filled countless pages of Now that voice is silenced. Wayne Morse has passed from us. He belongs to the ages. The Senator from Rhode Island did not always agree with the Senator from Oregonbut the Senator from Rhode Island never lost respect for the character and convictions and the deep humanity of Wayne Morse. I value the editorial epitaph from the New York Times of Tuesday. July 23. entitled \"The Senates Loss.\" And I prize these lines: Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon was too much the maverick . . . too much the gadfly . . . to be a hero of the Senate establishmenttoo much the independent to be predictable even in his proved liberalism. He was a superb public servantnot in spite of these attributes but because of them. The death of Wayne Morse is. indeed. the Senates loss. For we remember the deep humanity and sympathetic nature beneath and beyond the persistence of the debatorthe soul of kindness and thoughtfulness. We have known him to postpone a principal address on this floor that he might first speak words of appreciation and comfort to a Senate staff member who chanced to be hospitalized at that moment. And if it were a colleague temporarily affected. Wayne Morse would be the first with his visit and his sympathy. A student of the law. a teacher of the law. a maker of the law. the three score years and ten of his life Wayne Morse dedicated to service and to his fellow men. He was a great American. And the sympathy of all America goes to his loved onesthe wife and children of his heart and home.",

Although I have expressed support for most of the provisions of the settlements bill. I feel that to repeal HUDs authority to regulate settlement rates would strip the consumer of an important protection against exorbitant settlement costs. The repeal this authority would give the settlement industry the green light to raise its charges without restraint. Many of the provisions of S. 3164 are new and untried. and it therefore seems most prudent to retain the one statutory provision that does ultimately insure the consumer a fair shake. This one sure provision is the authority to put ceilings on settlement charges.

The existing act states that military dependents may only be placed in \"private nonprofit. public and State institutions and facilities\" for institutional care. It is my feeling that private institutions should not be excluded from participating in any Government supported program where there is no reasonable basis for limiting participating to nonprofit institutions. The choice of an institution for child care is a parental decision and parents should be able to select from among institutions which qualify under various local. State or Federal regulations and licenses. as the case may be. The various prices. qualities. locations and other characteristics of each available institution. private or public. are the functional criteria for making this choice. There is no reason to exclude the class of profit institutions from the program since this class can compete with nonprofit institutions in all of the aspects relating to selection and should have the opportunity to do so. This legislation is identical to legislation which I introduced last year. At that time. it received a favorable review by the Department of Defense.

This bill will provide for effective control of lobster fisheries on the Continental Shelf of the United States by amending existent legislation to make the lobster a creature of the shelf. Under present Federal law. foreign vessels are prohibited from harvesting Continental Shelf fishery resources except in conformity with conditions prescribed by the United States or as expressly provided by an international agreement to which the United States is a party. The legislation is badly needed and long overdue. In recent years. foreign fishing fleetsparticularly Russian. Japanese and Polishhave been lobstercatching with relative abandon off the U.S. coast. In my own State of Maine. in the last 11 years. the lobster yield has dropped by more than 30 percent while the number of lobstermen has increased by more than 25 percent. It is not that the lobster is becoming more intelligent. It is that there is too much lobstercatching off the Maine coast. particularly by foreign fishermen. This legislation will help remedy this situation. At the same time. making the lobster a creature of the Continental Shelf will not prejudice the conclusion of a comprehensive international fishing agreement. Indeed. the passage of this legislation by the Congress should stimulate serious negotiation. At this time.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. I and my colleagues from Idaho. in both the Senate and House of Representatives. are introducing legislation designed to alleviate a situation facing the people in the southern half of our State which is both potentially dangerous and economically devastating. The 45yearold American Falls Dam. located on the Snake River. has deteriorated structurally and has been listed by the Bureau of Reclamation as unsound. The restrictions placed on the use of this dam and its reservoir have severely limited an economy largely based on irrigated croplands. There are two bills which I send forward today: The first would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to construct. operate and maintain a replacement dam as a conventional project under the Federal reclamation program. costing an estimated $29 million for construction. The second measure would not require any Federal assistance. but. rather. authorize a construction of a replacement structure by the water users. The Secretary of the Interior would be authorized to take title to the dam. which then would be operated as part of the Upper Snake River Reclamation project. In the first legislation. there are considerable pitfalls. chief among them. the possibility of delays in funding or impoundment of appropriated funds. Under the second bill. shorter construction time would be insured. something vital to the people and farms served by this project. In curtailing the water storage of the present failing structure. the Bureau of Reclamation has rightfully considered the paramount issue of safety. But. in the replacement of this dam. time is of the essence. The storage limitations have exposed irrigators to crop failure. by an estimated 600.000 acrefeet water loss. This could spell a possible $100 million loss in south Idaho farm income. Obviously. the only solution to this dilemma is construction of a new. stronger structure as soon as possible.

Second. Congressmen are seldom experts in defense systems and foreign policy and tend to defer to what they see as executive expertise. AsPn has no facile answer to our failure to exercise our power.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in recent months. I have been shocked by the callous indifference of the administration to conflictofinterest problems which have arisen in Treasury and other agencies which critically affect vital policies of the United States. It has recently come to my attention that William Johnson. formerly Assistant Administrator of the Federal Energy Office and presently in the office of the Secretary of the Treasury. will resign his post on July 9. 1914. It is my further understanding that Mr. Johnson will assume the post of \"intermittent consultant\" to the Secretary of the Treasury on July 15. 1974. at the highest allowable rate of over $138 per day. However. on June 6. 1974. Mr. Johnson was apparently hired on contract by the American Enterprise Institute. a private research group in Washington. to produce a paper for the institute on fuel allocation. a subject in which he and his FEO office have been deeply involved. Of further interest. is the fact that Mr. Johnson was the person in charge of Mr. Robert Bowen. who was on leave of absence from -he Phillips Petroleum Co. while working for the Federal Energy Office. It was Mr. Johnson who assured the FEO and the Treasury General Counsel that Mr. Bowen was not in conflict of interest in any way in connection with his work. Repeatedly. I have been assured by FEOs administrator. Mr. Sawhill. that Mr. Johnson assured him and Mr. Simon. that Mr. Bowen was not in conflict. The GAO. in its study of the Bowen case. saw fit to render it to the Justice Department for determination of whether conflict of interest violations have in fact occurred. It now appears. from the facts of the Johnson activities both on the Federal payroll and with the American Enterprise Institute. that further conflict questions now exist of a most serious nature. It is my hope that both the Justice Department and the Treasury Department will proceed with dispatch to resolve these two cases and others which might exist in FEO and Treasury to assure the American people that their Federal agencies are in fact working in the public interest free of apparent or real conflicts of interest. I intend to continue my efforts to insist that the laws dealing with conflict of interest are adhered to. particularly in these sensitive agencies.",

I have taken the floor of the House of Representatives to voice what I feel to be the importance of continued research and development and its interrelationship with the publicprivate partnership. Inasmuch as I have persistently stressed this concept as a projected goal. I felt it incumbent upon me to report to my colleagues on a specific instance of this type of combined progress. I am moved to comment on this today for I have just learned that the Union Trust Co.. headquartered in Stamford and New Haven. Conn.. has announced that it has installed for permanent use a novel electronic telecommunication system developed by a federally funded project. a system which has as its goals the conservation of gasoline resources and executive traveltime. The system. which uses telecommunications techniques to conduct meetings between distant facilities without the need for travel. was developed by the national pilot New Rural Society project underway in northeastern Connecticut. The New Rural Society project is funded under a $462.000 grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to Fairfield University to explore the applications of electronic communications to help improve the quality of life in rural America. The NRS project is being directed by Dr. Peter C. Goldmark. president of Goldmark Communications Corp. Union Trust executives have been experimenting with the twoway teleconferencing system for the past several months to hold meetings between the banks major facilities 40 miles apart in Stamford and New Haven. The teleconferencing system is being used to link electronically its two major offices for many policy and other management meetings involving bank officials. The system enables executives to carry on joint sessions without requiring any of the participants to travel from one city to the other. The system uses special stereophonic telecommunications technology to draw \"sound images\" to substitute for facetoface meetings. Commenting on the systems potential in conserving natural resources Michael H. Moskow. HUD assistant secretary for Policy Development and Research. said: HUD is pleased to have made possible this demonstration of the substantial benefits which can result from innovative applicatons of existing technology. The teleconferencing development carried out as part of the New Rural Society project is a significant milestone in the effort to conserve our natural resources. We are particularly pleased to see private sector institutions investing",

We do need people trained appropriately and it is critical that college people in the midst of their training should be encouraged to receive training in the provision of services. As a matter of fact. as the gentleman and I have discussed. this bill already includes a provision for the training of these types of personnel. Section 122 of existing law authorizes the award of demonstration and training grants to schools of higher education. The authorizations for appropriations for such grants is continued by the provisions of H.R. 14215. In 1973. over 50.000 persons received training under this section and HEWs Division of Developmental Disabilities estimates that between 35 and 40 percent of these trainees were in the fields of psychology. sociology. or social work. Moreover. section 130 (a) (3) of the bill authorizes special project grants for training of specialized personnel for the provision of services with developmental disabilities. Thus. the authority which the gentlemans amendment would provide already exists in the provisions of the bill before us. So that I can assure the gentleman that the purposes of his amendment are covered in the bill. and it is the intention of the committee that the types of training proposed in the gentlemans amendment be used where possible. and that HEW. in awarding grants and contracts under sections 122 and 130 give particular attention to such programs.

It also means modern rail passenger service for all parts of the country. Recognizing this fact. I actively supported the creation of Amtrak in 1970. The original charter instructed Amtrak to provide continuing service over a pared down rail network by contracting out to participating railroads for the necessary equipment and services. and required Amtrak to issue common stock or an equivalent tax deduction to these companies. Congress also provided Amtrak with a $40 million grant to cover start up costs and $100 million in loan guarantees to conduct a capital improvement system. While Amtrak has had its imperfections and has faced a series of problems in assuming control of rail passenger service. I am aware of what it has accomplished and I anxiously await improvements in the quality of its operations that will bring faster and more frequent service throughout the Northeast. in New England and in other parts of the country.

It is easy to understand the demand for rail service is greatest in the Northeast corridor. It is also easy to understand that costly improvements must be made in the Northeast region. At the same time. Amtrak was given a mandate for nationwide rail passenger service. To follow this mandate. Amtraks commitment must be nationwide. It should also be stated. and stated forcefully. that the congressional policy should not be subverted by the Office of Management and Budget or the Department of Transportation. Unless Amtrak supporters in Congress stand up and call the hand of this administration toward Amtrak. we may witness the demise of rail passenger service outside the Northeast corridor. For the sake of our energy reserves and our environment. moving people by rail should not become as extinct as the passenger pigeon. One way. and the best way in my opinion. to judge what is happening to the national Amtrak system is to evaluate the experiences of each individual train run.

Mexico has offered to alter its train schedules even at the risk of losing some business on the affected segments in order to establish good connections with Amtrak. but Amtrak for its part has not been willing to make any adjustments to its own schedule. In short. without reciting all the lengthy list of particulars. Amtrak has appeared unwilling to do anything in a positive manner to establish an acceptable level of service connecting with the Mexican system. The result is that we still have now a truncated service which. in effect. kicks passengers out at the end of the line in Laredo. leaving them stranded. This might be understandable if the railroad ended at Laredo. but it doesnt. I sincerely feel that Amtrak could make. and should make. a positive effort to establish this service. I hope that you will review this matter and interest yourself in it personally. because I believe that a good service is in the interest of Amtrak and would attract a good level of ridership. just as your improved services to Montreal have. With best wishes. I am Sincerely yours.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I think most of us understand the basic issue here. There has been spent $359.1 million. and this has been over a 4year period. Before Amtrak took over. the private railroads were losing on passenger service over $200 million a year. We authorize this year $200 million more. That would make at the end of the fiscal year $559.1 million. None of the Federal guarantee of loans that we have authorized have been defaulted upon. and we do not believe that none of them will be. I should like to explain to the House that in the ChicagotoMiami run the number of persons using this service this year through May has increased 138 percent. the ChicagotoSeattle run has increased 21 percent. the ChicagotoNew Orleans run has increased 32 percent. the New YorktoFlorida run has increased 37 percent. The longhaul routes are showing gains. Last year they wanted to discontinue the ChicagoMiami run. It is up 138 percent this year. What I am trying to say is that with the energy shortage. there are more people who are riding these trains and who are going to ride them in the future. Congress has the duty to have vision. looking ahead not 1 year. but 10 years from now. 20 years. if we can. knowing that we are almost at a saturation point of cars today. We have built all of these roads across America. We cannot keep building more or we are going to have macadam all over the land. We just cannot do it. We cannot build parking lots if we are going to continue to saturate America with cars. A lot of these people are people who do not have cars. the aged and the young. who want to go from point to point. They do not have automobiles or any transportation. Looking ahead 10 years from now. it is going to have to be the major mass transportation system across the land. because automobiles just cannot do it. For that reason I think the bill ought to be passed.",

The provision to which I refer is title X and the programs authorized under it to encourage and promote improved fish and wildlife enhancement and conservation practices among our Nations private. agricultural landowners. As members of the Committee on Agriculture. we worked closely with many wildlife conservationists in formulating these provisions. Why do I favor such a program? Residents of the countryside live daily with the game and fish and know the wonders of the animal kingdom. They have a natural interest in seeing that the game and fish populations prosper. Many of them have expressed concern to me and others of my colleagues about the need for encouraging the expansion of fish and wildlife populations. The problems they face are the same as many others face in attempting to work for the general interest of our Nationa shortage of the cash with which to carry on their efforts. What title X does. is make it possible for the Secretary of Agriculture to carry on a realistic. practical and workable program involving our farm families in expanding their activities on behalf of fish and wildlife. This program provides the Secretary with the authority to enter into long range contractsup to 25 yearswith eligible landowners and operators to engage in a cost sharing and grant assistance program to carryout programs to increase our supplies of deer. squirrels. doves. turkeys. bass. trout. and other such wildlife and fish. The resources and management capabilities of our public agencies are geared to working with the big picture and the big tract of land. The services that they perform are vital to our efforts in this field. But. they can do only so much with the limited resources at their hand. It is very easy to see that the programs which are authorized under title X can have a dramatic effect on the future of our efforts in fish and wildlife enhancement.",

We have just provided in the food stamp section of this very bill for escalation of the grants to the recipients of food stamps in event the cost of living goes up. We have recently provided increases in the salaries of Federal employees. We have increased the benefits of recipients of social security benefits when the cost of living goes up. I know of no reason why we should make an exception of farmers and frankly I do not believe that the President of the United States is going to say that he is going to make such an exception. Of course. he would like to have the cheapest bill he can get. But a cheap bill that does not do justice is not the kind of bill we want. I would therefore hope that we would do justice to the farmers and treat them at least as well as we treat other groups of our society. treat them on the same basis that we treat other groups of our society.

The overspending involves $115 million in personnel funds during 1970 and raises the possibility of at least $50 million in overspending in operations and maintenance funds for 1971. The army audit report says: Had obligations for pay and allowances been properly stated and other accounts appropriately adjusted Appropriations Accounts for FY70 would have shown an apparent overobligation of about $115 million. But. Mr. Speaker. in fairness to the Army I must report that the findings of the Army report have been disputed by senior officials in the service. According to the Deputy Secretary of the Army for Fiscal Management. Mr. Saintsing. \"after careful review of the report it is still my conclusion that no overobligation of appropriations has occurred.\" Senior Department of Defense officials are awaiting the results of an ongoing General Accounting Office investigation which I originally requested to determine if illegal overspending has occurred or not. Top Army officials consider the numerous transfers of funds to avoid socalled overobligations to be perfectly proper. However. if the GAO finds that overspending has occurred and it is considered willful. then some senior Army officials should be punished. According to Federal law. any socalled willful overspending can be punished by a $5.000 fine and 2 years in jail. Even if the overspending is not considered willful the law requires that any department submit a full report to Congress explaining the causes of any overobligation. The Army audit report also says that: Fund availability for operations and maintenance for FY 71 was increased by transfer from other appropriations and other reimbursement actions. We question the propriety of $60 million of such transfers. Book juggling. overspending and mismanagement seem to be becoming the rule rather than the exception. Neither Congress nor the public can tolerate any more book juggling or overspending by the militaryits got to stop and its got to stop now.",

Levels of effort The subcommittee was struck with the great variations in the levels of effort made towards national defense by the European partners. In some cases. the percentage of GNP spent on national defense is as high as that of the United States. It was particularly interesting to the subcommittee that the countries of Turkey. Greece. and Portugal. which are the poorest of the Alliance. spend the greatest share of their resources on national defense. except for the U.K.. in each case about 6 percent of their GNP. It seems to the subcommittee that their far more prosperous northern allies could make an equal sacrifice of resources. Turkey. in particular. maintains a large standing army although that places great strain on its resources.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I do not have as much time as the gentleman from Iowa to look the budget over item by item. but I would like to point out a couple of things to him which he may have missed. In the past year. the Government has spent $550.000 for a couple of pandas the President got as a present from the Chinese Peoples Republic. As far as the west wall is concerned. if we spend as much per Member to do the west wall as they have spent per panda in the executive branch. we could build twice as much west front as we plan to build. because the cost would be just twice what they say it is going to be at the greatest estimate. I do not make any apology for the committee this morning voting about 2 to 1 to give the Members more money for staff. We had a survey made. and the constituents are really responsible for this. because the mail around here has increased about 25 percent over the last Congress. I suppose most people expect that mail to be answered. I collaborated many times with my dear friend from Iowa on projects for which we have a similar interest. but I must say that I do recall his standing up here the last time we got a raise for Congressmen and talking against it. We have since had six or seven costofliving increases for all the help around here. I know that I would vote for another raise for Members now if I had a chance. The gentleman stood up and gave a long peroration about how much he was opposed to this increase in salary. but I checked on it the first month the checks went out and he accepted his. as he said he wouldI will give him credit for that. I asked him on the floor and he said that if we forced him to take it. he was going to take it. Now. we are forcing him to put on another staff member. I suppose. although he must write a letter and request it. I might say to the gentleman that if he writes the letter and requests it. it will be approved routinely the same as for everyone else.

I rise in support of the amendment of the gentleman from California and to commend the efforts of our colleague from New York in helping bring the issue before this body in clear terms. The debate has been constructive. and has made clear the fact that the issue boils down to a demandI will not say needfor space in the Capitol for the leadership and some Members. So the question is. at this time in history. do we want to spend this kind of money for this purpose? My answer is no. The Senate recently voted to sustain the Presidents veto of the vocational rehabilitation bill. And we in this chamber voted to sustain the veto of the rural water and sewer program. I joined in that effort. though with great reluctance. in the overriding interest of helping stabilize the economy through budgetary restraint. The spending of $60 million for the West Front extension. aside from other considerations I cited in my remarks in the RECORD on April 4. at page 11125. conflicts with that objective. We have approved a $20 million Visitors Center near the Capitol and a major expansion of the Library of Congress with the Madison Library. and also taken over the Congressional Hotel in the search for more space.

During floor consideration of this legislation. the House voted 339 to 49 to eliminate the ignition interlock and to require an option between the airbag and a seatbelt/shoulder harness system. While technically there is no comparable provision in the Senate version of this bill. a Senate amendment to another bill. which passed 62 to 21. would delay adoption of airbag requirements by the Department of Transportation until after public hearings have been held. Regulations currently being proposed by DOT would make airbags mandatory on all cars manufactured after August 15. 1976. To allow DOT to put such a regulation into effect is to assure a repeat of the kind of public outrage generated by the ignition interlock. Alrbags are extremely expensive. costing about $300 per car. and $600 for repair and replacement after use. A seatbelt/shoulder harness package costs about $50 per car. More Important. however. is the lack of protection provided by alrbags in certain accidents as compared to seatbelts. No protection. for example. is provided in lateral or rearend collisions. and in a rollover an airbag Is effective only when used in conjunction with a lapbelt. Under these conditions. why not simply stay with a seat belt/shoulder harness system? These and other problems raised by adoption of a mandatory airbag regulation are pointed out In the following letter to the House membership from Lynn A. Townsend. chairman of the board of Chrysler Corp. While I do not agree with his Interpretation of my amendment as it might relate to a seatbeltairbag option.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last year marked the 100th anniversary of the invention of the cable car. San Francisco celebrated the cable car centennial in various ways. One of the unique elements of the celebration was the decision to secure congressional authorization for the U.S. Mint to strike a medal commemorating the cable cars first 100 years. Public Law 93114. signed October 1. 1973. authorized the mint to strike 150.000 cable car medals. The medals will be sold. and the proceeds will be used to defray expenses connected with the National and San Francisco Bicentennial celebrations in 1976. The city conducted a 4month national competition to select the design which will appear on the medals. The authorizing legislation set a time limit of December 31. 1974. for striking the cable car medals. At the time. that appeared to be a reasonable amount of time in which to accomplish the task. Now. however. it is apparent that the mint may have some problems striking the cable car medals within that time period. due principally to pressures to produce a number of Bicentennial medals and due also to the fact that the mint works on medals such as the cable car medal only on a \"time available\" basis. The city has just submitted Its first orders to the mint for 5.000 silver and 10.000 bronze medals. Later orders will be submitted until the 150.000 total is reached. Because it now appears likely. however. that the citys orders and the mints production may not reach the total by the end of this year. an amendment to the authorizing statute is required. The city therefore requests. with the concurrence of the mint. that the time limit for producing the cable car medals be extended 2 years. through I hope all my colleagues will join with me in support of this noncontroversial legislation. I am enclosing for the REcoRD copies of letters of support for this bill from the U.S. Mint and the city of San Francisco:",

The best way to obtain answers concerning the MIAs is for the Communists to allow neutral country search teams to go to the crash sites to determine the fate of the missing and return the remains of known dead for proper burial. Under paragraph 8B of the Paris peace accords. we are permitted to do this. but were fired upon by the Communists when we tried to do so in the past. Here in the States we are releasing draft dcdgers and deserters from the prisons. I must say our priorities are fouled up.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I introduce. as chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. a bill to establish a National Cemeteries System within the Veterans Administration. This bill. which is entitled the National Cemeteries Act of 1973 is identical to the bill which unanimously passed the Senate on October 9. 1972. and unanimously passed the House of Representatives on October 11. 1972. only to be pocket vetoed by the President in a memorandum of disapproval on October 27. 1972. The bill which passed the House and the Senate last fall and which is reintroduced today is the product of numerous hearings and intensive consideration by Congress. In 1966. 5 days of hearings were devoted to the subject of a National Cemeteries System. In March of 1968 the U.S. Veterans Advisory Commission formally recommended the establishment of a National Cemeteries System and an increase in veterans burial allowances. Subsequently in 1968. the House Committee on Veterans Affairs held 3 days of hearings on the subject and reported a national cemetery bill which was not acted upon. In the 91st Congress 3 additional days of hearings were held in 1970 covering the National Cemeteries System. Finally. in the past Congress both the House and the Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs each held 2 days of hearings on the National Cemeteries Act of 1972 which was subsequently passed by both Houses. Given this background. I believe the Senate can and should proceed to very early consideration of this measure. We are rapidly running out of available gravesites in our national cemeteries. The recent closing of Culpeper National Cemetery in Culpeper. Va.. now means for example. that apart from Arlington National Cemetery which has highly restrictive eligibility requirements. there are no regular gravesites available in any national cemetery from Long Island to North Carolina.

We in the 93d Congress are again committed to making further Inroads on this complex and often difficult aspect of our maritime commerce. Now a new dimension is being added to the picture. a dimension attributable to our rapidly escalating need for energy imports: Deep water transfer terminals for handling of crude oil from tankers of a \"super\" size. In the past. I have voiced my concern about the utilization of deep water port facilities in light of the need to meet this Nations energy requirements. Now they appear to be but a few years from reality. At the same time. I have been deeply concerned about the use of tankers and supertankers. recognizing the potential threat that can result from either a tanker collision or grounding. or from normal transfer operations. An oil spill resulting from either type of accident. especially when you consider the size of the proposed supertankers. might well be disasterous in the coastal zone. Puget Sound in my own State is one of the locations being considered for a superport site due to its unusually deep waters which can easily accommodate deep draft supertankers close to shore. The present rate of oil movement on the sound is approximately 12 million gallons a day. With the advent of Alaska oil the total would jump to about 120 million gallons per day. The oil will probably be carried in vessels of about 120.000 deadweight tons. the same size as the now infamous Torrey Canyon. A University of Washington study has estimated that there will be three collisions in Puget Sound in the next 10 years involving these new supertankers. This prediction does not include groundings which are a more serious source of oil pollution. So the dangers are quite real. Because of my deep concern about this problem. today. I am cosponsoring with Senator HOLLINGS a bill to insure complete consideration of environment factors associated with these terminals and other offshore facilities. The incalculable value of our coastal resources necessitates careful planning for such mammoth undertakings and I believe this legislation will assist the final resolution of the Issue.",

This legislation would allow the President to restrict travel by U.S. citizens or nationals to any country whose military forces are engaged in armed conflict with the military forces of the United States. This restriction would close a loophole in our present law which the trips of Jane Fonda and Ramsey Clark have demonstrated. The actions of these individuals caused irreparable harm by not only casting doubt and unrest in the minds of our young soldiers but also in the minds of American prisoners of war. Mr. President. can you imagine how these prisoners feel when they hear such adverse statements by U.S. citizens about their own Government. Such statements are broadcast throughout the POW compounds and certainly heighten the abject despair these men must feel. Mr. President. a terrible problem exists when such misguided activities become ready tools for Communist propaganda. While we are winding down the war in Vietnam. it becomes more and more Important that we do not forget the plight of our POWs. These men must not think that the United States has forgotten them as such Irresponsible broadcasts probably lead them to believe. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and halt the damage which is being caused by U.S. citizens who are allowed to travel to an enemy country without official authorization. Never before in the history of our Nation has such a situation existed. I feel that we owe these prisoners more than this and I am sure that every concerned American will agree. Mr. President.

I introduce for appropriate reference. a proposed amendment to the Constitution to prohibit forced busing of school children on the basis of race. and I introduce for appropriate reference a bill to limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts to issue busing orders based on race. These proposals are similar to proposals that I offered and advocated. in the last session of Congress. Mr. President. over a year ago I made the following statement: As one who wants to make more and more progress toward racial equality and an integrated society. I am deeply concerned that forced busing solely for the purpose of achieving racial balance is counterproductive. Instead of helping In the effort to promote better race relations. it is resulting In more bitterness and more polarization. Unfortunately. Mr. President. this assessment of forced busing is even more true today. In that 1971 statement I also took note of Chief Justice Burgers expression that some district courts were going beyond constitutional requirements in ordering forced busing. Since then. confusion at the district court level has been compounded by decisions handed down by the Fourth and Sixth Circuit Courts of Appeals in the Richmond and Detroit cases. As yet. the Supreme Court has not resolved the problem. Because of failure on the part of the Judiciary. I have strongly advocated enactment by Congress of legislation in the hope that Congress would be more responsive to the will of the great majority of Americans. So far. the response of Congress has been less than satisfactory. Antibusing provisions attached to the 1972 higher education bill proved to be weak and ineffective. And despite the fact that a majority in both the House and Senate stood ready to vote for stronger legislation in the last session. procedural delays in the Senate prevented it from becoming law. Following through on a pledge made to the people of Michigan during the campaign.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to reintroduce a bill for myself and my colleague. Mr. GRAVEL. to amend section 2634(a) of title 10. United States Code. This will authorize the shipment of privately owned vehicles to and from Alaska by commercial carrier by the Alaska ferry system and other surface transportation. This bill was introduced by us in the 92d Congress and was also introduced by our colleague. Mr. Begich. in the House. The bill. H.R. 15621. passed the House of Representatives late in the session. However. because of the press of time. it could not be taken up on this side. We are reintroducing It with the hope that hearings will be possible early in the 93d Congress. Mr. President. this bill would give the military departments more flexibility in moving privately owned automobiles of military personnel stationed in Alaska to and from Alaska in that it would allow shipment by water transportation. railroad transportation. or a combination thereof. At the present time. there is only one carrier serving Anchorage directly by water. The language of the existing law prohibits use of any mode of transportation except water carrier. This means that under existing law the carriers serving Anchorage by water have all the military privately owned vehicle business. There are other land carriers interested in the business. who would be able to compete if this bill were law. In addition. the military departments have indicated in the past. and I am certain that feeling has not changed now. that they would like to have several modes to choose from. As a rille. competition for Government business keeps Government costs down. Therefore. Mr. President. if this bill is enacted. benefits will be fourfold: First. it will allow several carriers to bid on the military business to and from Alaska.

These include naval airbases and radar defense sites. civilian weather stations. flight service stations. and navigation aids. Employees on these sites share an isolation from normal transportation. There are no roads. no railways. and airlines are infrequently scheduled to allow these Federal employees access to the rest of the United States. Along the outer edges of this country. these employees and their families may have to wait days until a plane arrives to take them to a city with regularly scheduled service to the \"outside.\" As an example. Adak Naval Station on the Aleutian Islands employs 162 civilians. With their dependents. this group comprises 400 civilians who are isolated from regular travel connections. Leave time is a treasure for these people. Under the current regulations. leave time of Federal employees is consumed even while they are awaiting a flight from their post. Their return to the base is much more unpredictable. Precious amounts of time must be taken from their vacations to find a flight back to Adak. This bill will ensure that Federal employees in all remote areas of the country will enjoy the full amount of their leave time away from their isolated outposts. Under this bill. leave will not include time lost in travel from posts more than 200miles distant from a city or town with regular transportation access to the \"outside.\" I call my colleagues attention particularly to the language in the new subsection (e) (2). This differs from the language of S. 410 which I introduced last Congress in order to meet a technical suggestion of the General Accounting Office. This amended language clarifies my legislative intent that the post of duty must be at least 200miles distant from a place where daily airplane or rail services is available. The place to which the employee Is eventually traveling however. need not be at least 200mile distant from the duty post.

    "speech": "The amendment that I have offered this afternoon narrows the issue to deal with a particular case that arose in a school district in the State of Maryland where I think the question was not at all a question of the integration of the school. or the success that this county or our State has had in integrating the schools. it is a matter of continued harassment by officials of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. which places an undue and uncalled for burden upon the administrators of the school system. In May of 1973 the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare commenced an investigation of alleged discriminatory treatment of minority students in disciplinary actions taken by the school system in Anne Arundel County. Md. The amendment. then. deals with two difficult subjects: One is discrimination. and the other is discipline. It is interesting to note. Mr. President. that the 6th annual Gallup poll on public attitudes toward public education indicated that our citizens regarded lack of discipline as the number one school problem. Indeed. school discipline has been rated the number one problem in 5 of the last 6 years. It is interesting that in the Gallup special survey of high school juniors and seniors a higher percentage of students than the adults. named discipline as the leading problem facing local schools. The second ranking problem. according to Gallups citizens survey. was integrationsegregation problems. So this is an extremely important issue before the Senate today. I believe that this Nation cannot tolerate nor condone discriminatory treatment of students. Disciplinary action should be applied in a fair and evenhanded manner. However. I do not believe that a statistical difference alone indicates discrhnination. In this case. HEW received general complaintsand I mean they were generalfrom a group of parents in May of 1973. I ask unanimous consent that the complaint. and the school systems response. be printed in the RECORD following my remarks.",

I think I would agree to what the Senator from New York has proposed. However. in this instance. I think the matter has gone too far. We have been trying to get HEW to be responsible with this school system in answering the complaints since May of 1973. Rather than deal with the complaints that have been made against the school system. HEW has continued to compound the difficulty and ask for more information and reach out into more subject areas. The reason why I have narrowed this amendment in this manner is that it applies only to pilot programs which deal with discrimination in disciplinary action. This Is the only pilot program that I know of in the country today. Therefore I do not think we do any injustice to anybody by attaching this amendment at this time to this bill. I think It should be a matter of legislative oversight. If the Department of HEW wanted to pursue pilot investigation. it would be proper for them to come before the Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and explain the program. we could work out general procedures and guidelines. In the meantime. I think we ought to hold the whole matter in abeyance. and that is what I have done in my amendment. I am asking them to justify the need for pilot investigations into this area. I think it would be wise to have a hearing on this subject and have HEW come up. Then. If it is determined that there is a necessity for this kind of investigation. we legislatively can move ahead and remove any prohibition that might exist as a result of action taken here today.",

I have tried to make my position clear to the Secretary of HEW. If he does not know my position now. he does not listen to his telephone conversations nor answer his mail. because we have had frequent correspondence. To show the Senate how voluminous that correspondence is. this is our correspondence file on this particular matter. So I think it is not possible for the Secretary to get the message in any other way than by having the Senate take some action here today. saying. \"We want you to respond to vague complaints in fairness to the school system before you embark upon some systemwide investigation to get information on particular subject matter.\" I do not think this in any way gets into the matters discussed in the Helms amendment.

If they had the support they should have had from sound proponents with the right ideas. including some In the administration. we would have come back with even better legislation. I am not bitter but I cannot help but be critical. As we drive down our interstate highways. as we drive down other highways partially funded by the Federal Government where they axe constructing portions of the highway with Federal tax money paid for highway construction. we see signs that read something like this. \"Your highway taxes at work.\" Crews are digging. they are pouring cement. they are erecting bridges of one kind or another. Since this new highway bill now provides for diversion from the highway fund of some construction to the purchase of buses. to the purchase of equipment. and eventually. I am sure. the bottomless pit of operating subsidy. I rue the day when. instead of putting signs on the side of the road. \"Your highway taxes at work\" building highways. they will have some highspeed bus purchased with highway tax construction money with a sign hung on the rear. \"Your highway taxes at work.\" I wonder how many of the people who paid those highway taxes for the construction of highways. are going to appreciate that bus pushing them off the highway.

This budget contains projected expenditures of $304.4 billion which is an 11 percent increase in Federal spending over last year. and it contains a builtin deficit of $9.4 billion which is more than double last years deficit. Review of this budget and others of recent years clearly indicates that deficit spending is becoming a permanent way of life. insofar as the financial operations of our country are concerned. It is estimated that the total national debt will climb to $346.5 billion by the end of 1974. and $359 billion at the end of 1975. The interest alone on this debt is approaching $30 billion annually. This live today. pay tomorrow philosophy of Government finance cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely for tomorrow will surely come. We cannot sustain a burgeoning public obligation year after year without experiencing adverse economic effects. The rampant inflation that has afflicted our economy during recent years has been fueled in great part by unrestrained Government spending. There will be no brightening in the economic horizon until we take positive steps to reform our fiscal policies. We spent a great deal of time discussing fiscal reform during the last session. our efforts culminated in the passage of the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1973. I have every hope that final action on this legislation will be forthcoming in the near future. This will provide us with a mechanism for budgetary control. it will still be necessary to mold a new philosophy of Government spendinga philosophy which recognizes the limitations of Federal dollars and the need for curing our apparent addiction to deficit spending. Mr. Speaker. let it not be said that the legacy left by Congress in the 1970s was that of a bankrupt estate and economic chaos.

Todays bill authorizes the appropriation of $50 million to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration over a 5year period. The energy crisis is the most urgent and immediate economic problem confronting the Nation and world today. and it is mandatory that Congress act aggressively and promptly in providing the necessary legislation to move forward with energy research and development programs.

This would allow funding to be in place for energy activities in advance of the new fiscal year and would do much to promote orderly planning and efficient execution of the energy programs of the various Federal agencies. The Appropriations Committee proposes to move as rapidly as possible toward the enactment of the energy appropriation bill. but it will be impossible for the committee to take timely action unless the necessary authorizing legislation is enacted at an early date.

For example. until recently. no one knew how many students there were in graduate school until many years after the fact. This situation is improving with the prompt collection of information by the Council of Graduate Schools. I have just come across a most pertinent analysis of this information by Robert Snyder. a graduate student who L a summer intern with the Association of American Universities. This is the kind of data that Congress needs not only relating to postsecondary education. but to elementary and secondary education as well. In summary. Mr. Snyders figures show that: First. large increases in graduate enrollment have stopped. and annual increases in the early 1970s are much more modest. apparently setting a trend for the decade ahead. Second. the recent increases have been concentrated primarily in public universities and in the newer socalled nonelite institutions. While total enrollment for all universities increased 1.9 percent from the fall of 1971 to the fall of 1972. it increased by only 0.3 percent in all private universities compared to 2.3 percen in all public institutions. A similar distinction existed between the top 60rated institutions and the other 215 universities in the survey. The nonelite public universities accounted for 87.8 percent of the increase in total enrollment for this period. Third. contrary to widespread assertions. more of the Nations top universitiespublic and private--increased firsttime graduate enrollment between 1971 and 1972 than decreased enrollment. Fourth. doctorates awarded for 197172 rose at higher rate5.9 percentthan enrollment. indicating the larger enrollments of 5 to 7 years ago when the new doctorates were first entering graduate school. Once again. the vast majority of new doctorates came from the nonelite public universities80.5 percentdemonstrating that the shift in growth to these institutions has been going on for some time now.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to take this opportunity to call the Senates attention to the first American Revolution Bicentennial event for the State of Kansas taking place in Atchison today. Appropriately. this event honors a woman and a pioneer. She was not a pioneer who led the settlement of the prairie sod. rather she was a pioneer who led the way in the conquest of the air. Her name was Amelia Earhart. Ten years ago. on the 65th anniversary of her birth. the Amelia Earhart commemorative stamp was issued in her hometown. Atchison. Kans. A major event in the ceremonies associated with the issuance of this stamp was the participation of the NinetyNines. a group of distinguished women pilots which Amelia Earhart served as first president. They joined in paying tribute to their first leader by having a flyaway which took the first day cover of the Amelia Earhart stamp to every State capital and foreign countries around the globe. Today. 10 years after the issuance of the Amelia Earhart stamp and the 75th birthday anniversary of her birth. the NinetyNines will again return at Atchison for another flyaway. This time they will be carrying miniature bicentennial flags and seedling trees from the International Forest of Friendship which is being planted at Warnock Lake in Atchison. These seedlings and flags will be taken to every State capital and also carried to more than 30 foreign countries where they will symbolize an invitation to visit the United States during our bicentennial year. 1976. Mr. President. Amelia Earhart ranks as one of Kansas outstanding citizens from any era. And in this age when air transportation plays such an important role in bringing the people of the world together. I feel that it is particularly appropriate and fitting that her name be linked with the first bicentennial event in Kansas. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the NinetyNines for their participation in this event. And I would give special recognition to the citizens of Atchison for their outstanding tributes to one of the great women of Kansas and of America. I am sure this weeks events will be a great success. and I am pleased that the American Revolution Bicentennial celebration in Kansas is being inaugurated in such an outstanding way.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. an editorial recently appeared in the Mankato Free Press regarding the need for Government action to halt the abandonment of rail service to rural communities. As the Senate moves toward action on the Northeast rail crisis. I believe we should also take steps to avelt a less publicized. but equally serious. rail crisis affecting agricultural communities in many other parts of the Nation. The Nations agricultural transportation network is vital for the shipment of fertilizer. feed for poultry and livestock. and grain for milling and marketing. This year transportation will be required to move an estimated 13 percent increase in wheat. 6 percent in corn. and 24 percent increase in soybean production. Nevertheless. requests for the abandonment of rail lines serving farm communities flood the Interstate Commerce Commission. and in most cases such requests are approved. Often farm communities do not have roads with the carrying capacity required to handle their shipments. and unless rail service is continued. they would be left to wither and die. In the future. and especially with an additional 19 million acres in farmland scheduled to be brought back into production next year. the availability of rural rail transportation will be essential to rural America and to urban communities that need food at reasonable prices. I believe that the Senate should approve legislation providing for a moratorium on rail abandonments to insure that the transportation needs of rural America will be fully met while steps are also taken to provide better rural roads and to deal with the financial difficulties plaguing our rail transportation system. As evidence of the need for such action. I commend to my colleagues in the Senate the editorial from the Mankato Free Press. entitled \"Saving Branch Lines.\" Mr. President.

I wish to bring to the attention of my colleagues the following profile of Mrs. Eugenie Forde. a lady who has spent a life of loving commitment as nurse. midwife. mother. and community leader. In a 50year career. Mrs. Forde has assisted in over 4.500 births in the Virgin Islands. After studying at the municipal hospitals training school in St. Thomas. she began to practice nursing in 1920 when the majority of births occurred in the home. She walked miles and waited hours to welcome the newborn into the light. As modern medical discoveries influenced theories and techniques of childbirth. Mrs. Forde grew with her profession. She continued her studies at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Freedmens Hospital in Washington. and Columbia University in New York. These years of experience and education were rewarded in 1953 when Mrs. Forde was named supervisor of the obstetrical ward of the newly constructed Knud Hansen Memorial Hospital. The increased space and staff provided by this new facility brought most expectant mothers into the hospital to give birth. Mrs. Forde remained at this position until her retirement in 1970. To complement this career. Eugenie Forde maintained an active role in such community organizations as the Catholic Daughters of America. the Friends of Denmark. and the Womens League. Her civic and professional contributions were acknowledged with the following awards: \"Woman of the Year\" by the Business and Professional Womens Club. and \"Nurse of the Year\" by the Womens League. As if this public activity was not enough to dominate her time. Eugenie also raised a family of 4. and is now the proud grandmother of 13. Mrs. Forde is a truly extraordinary woman whose inexhaustible humanity has touched the hearts of her fellow Virgin Islanders. I would like to add my most sincere thank you for the talent. energy. and love she has given so freely to our community.

Direct funding is provided on a formula basis to certain urban counties. central cities and all cities over 50.000. Communities that have been funded for community development at a rate higher than their formula allocationcalculated on the basis of population. poverty. and overcrowdingare protected in part against a cut in Federal aid during the first 3 years of the new program through a \"hold harmless\" provision. During the second 3 years. however. their funding level is phased down to their formula allocation. While the new title I block grant will mean fewer Federal restrictions and greater flexibility in program development. the title I funding system. we feel. will result in serious inequities. The formula allocation will be a boon to those cities that are not currently using Federal community development assistance. But the formula will mean a sharp decrease in funding for more than 100 cities now actively involved in urban renewal and/or model cities programs.

Mr. Slick was quoted as saying in the Pecos Enterprise: Backers of the Consumer Energy Act insist they dont intend to kill private enterprise. yet they are proposing. as an integral part of the Act. the establishment of a potential replacementto be known as the Federal Oil and Gas Corporation. As an executive in one of the worlds most powerful energy industries. Mr. Slick surely is aware of the anticompetative nature of the oil industries. Several studies have pointed out that the role played by the major oil companies in oil and other related industries hardly encourages competition. As a new element in the energy industry. the Federal Oil and Gas Corporationa publicly owned Corporationwould compete with the major oil companies. and would restore competative influences in a field where they are sorely needed. In further criticism of the Federal Oil and Gas Corporation. Mr. Slick said: Lacking operating and technical experionceto say nothing of the motive to make a profitthe new government company could hardly develop production as rapidly as private operators who otherwise would be developing the same leases. Private companies. however. have not proved themselves to be responsible developers or marketers. While consumer gasoline use dropped during the energy crisis this winter. prices reached alltime highs and the major oil companies reported astronomic profits. The consumer deserves to have a representative in the energy Industry. Research and development of alternate sources of energy must begin now. and a Federal Oil and Gas Corporation could make important inroads and encourage private development. One of the most important features of the proposed Federal Oil and Gas Corporation. however. is that it would act as a standard for evaluating major oil company production and profits. It would neither destroy free enterprise in the Industry nor limit American energy production. The Federal Oil and Gas Corporation would merely add competition to the industry and lend perspective to major oil company profits.",

These underdeveloped countries have onethird of all of the raw materials that are used in industry in the United States. Much of our needed raw materials come from these developing countries. Generally they are very rich in raw materials. We in this country are beginning to experience shortages in raw materials. Yet we have the technology to handle these raw materials. and these developing countries do not have such technology. So. Mr. Chairman. again I say that I do believe we can have a working and viable partnership with them. I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania . has made an extraordinarily good point in this record.",

I urge the passage of H.R. 11354 today. even though the $1.5 billion contribution to the International Development Association provided by the bill was conceived under the old order that existed prior to what is now called the energy crisis. That crisis has turned what looked like perennial balanceofpayments surpluses for most of the Industrialized countries into perennial deficits. The new holders of excess reserves will be the oilproducing countries. mainly in the Middle East. The proposed fourth replenishment fails to recognize this shift in world economic capacity and responsibility. With this in mind. I recently wrote Secretary of State Kissinger asling for a revamping of the World Bank family so as to permit vastly increased contributions and control by the oilproducing countries. in order to make the international economic effects of the oil crisis more manageable. Specifically. I suggested that the oilproducing countries \"buyin\" to the World Bank family and similar lending institutions by massive increases in their paidin capital subscriptions. in their purchases of lending institution bonds. in their contributions to IDA and similar special concessional windows. and by massive financing of a new \"third window\" at the lending insitutions. midway between the hard loan and the concessional credit.

We are going to be facing the situation probably beginning in about 6 months where many of the lesserdeveloped countries that do not produce their own energy and are dependent upon oil imports are going to go broke. They are going to go bankrupt. out monetary reserves. because they will not have the foreign exchange to purchase the oil. In Bangladesh they finally came lip with a decent rice crop. and then they found that in order to make their minimal oil purchases they were going to have to export a good part of that rice crop. Here is the irony of a country solving part of its agricultural problem and now they are going to have to export the crop. and then as a result they are going to have serious domestic food problems. I think IDA is needed today more than ever because as time goes by. we are going to have underdeveloped country after underdeveloped country going under because of the excess cost of energy today.

We are considering H.R. 11354 today. and H.R. 11666 is scheduled for tomorrow. These bills would authorize the continuation of the International Development AssociationIDAand the Asian Development BankADB. As my colleagues know. these are multilateral development lending institutions which provide both soft and hard loans to developing nations. I favor our participation in these multilateral development lending institutions. and feel it is better than bilateral foreign aid in assisting developing nations within the world community. In addition. our participation in replenishment of IDA funds was negotiated down by Secretary Shultz from 40 percent to 331/3 percent. The continuance of our participation in these institutions allows developing nations the opportunity to receive economic assistance from a cooperative group of nations. rather than as a \"handout\" on a bilateral basis. In addition. it is in the national interest for us to support developing nations through these institutions. Our future markets and our future sources of raw materials will depend on the developing countries sharing adequately in progress in the world economy. Thus. we have a stake in their future. yet we can share the cost of assisting the underdeveloped countries. I am pleased to note that the programs represented by these bills have been developed through consultation and cooperation between the Executive and Congress. We all feel it is important for Congress to exercise its legitimate prerogatives in the formulation of this kind of economic assistance. My support for these programs stems from my personal observation of their useful results. Last fall I had the valuable opportunity to look at a number of IDAfinanced projects.

I have asked for this time to discuss with the Senator from Maine what happens as a result of the Kennedy amendment and the action of the Rules Committee. :i expect that the temporary suspension of paragraph 6 of rule 25 is to provide for an orderly transition so that Senators initially serving on the Budget Committee will have until January 1977 to decide whether they will relinquish one of their other Class A standing committees or remain on the Budget Committee.

I think our support of that amendment sprang from the original proposal of the joint study committee. The joint study committee provided for a budget committee for each house with a percentage of members required to be drawn from the appropriations and taxwriting committees. In addition. there were special rules as to the chairmanship. We felt that such limitations as to composition of members and chairmanship could result in an imbalance of representation of Congressional views as to the budget and as to spending priorities. and that what we were doing was establishing a committee which in some ways would impinge upon the jurisdiction and prerogatives of each committee. and the authorization committee as well. So. we concluded that every Member of the Senate should be eligible for membership on the Budget Committee. It was for that reason that the proposal now advanced by the Senator from Wisconsin had the support of the Senator from Maine in subcommittee and the Senator from Montana in full committee. One drawback of that proposal from the beginning seemed to me to be a constant changing of the membership of the Budget Committee. a constantly changing membership of the committee so that members of the committee would not develop the kind of background. experience. and expertise that members of standing committees customarily develop in connection with their responsibilities. So with the changes that have been made. I expect. with the Senator from Montana. that the 1977 date will hold. At that point those who are members of the Budget Committee would make the decision whether or not to stay on that committee and give up another class A committee or the alternative.",

But. it stipulates that if Congress has exceeded the spending limits set in the most recent concurrent resolution. it cannot adopt the necessary trigger bill unless twothirds of the Members agree. If Congress had heeded their earlier resolution or if the Congress had provided for additional revenues to offset the added expenditures then the trigger bill could pass on a simple majority. My amendment would permit the House or Senate to resolve their differences over the upcoming years budget by forcing a meaningful debate over the total impact of our decisions.

The two principal features of the amendment are: First. to require that a trigger provision be included in all spending bills. and second. to require a twothird vote to increase any spending figures agreed to in the first concurrent resolution on the budget. or to approve an increase in the debt. as set in the first resolution. The trigger proposal was embodied in an amendment by Senator NUNN. It was not agreed to because it would create a situation in which the President could. with a single veto. wipe out the whole sessions work on spending bills. A delay in completing action on a reconciliation bill would force the Congress to rely on continuing resolutions to keep the Government going. thus negating the advantage in changing to an October 1 fiscal year. It might increase the likelihood of legislativeexecutive stalemate. because so much importance would be attached to a single measure. whose approval would be essential to the orderly functioning of the Government. The required twothirds vote to increase the spending figures set in the first resolution fails to take account of the gross inaccuracies which are characteristic of budget forecasting. As noted in the Rules Committee reportpage 13the average level of supplemental appropriations enacted over the past decade has been almost $10 billion per year. In addition the report also indicatedon page 21that underestimates of expenditures for nonappropriated programssuch as interest on the debt and social measure trustshave equalled almost $3 billion per year. over the past 5 years. Thus. the facts of life are that we will have incomplete or inaccurate information when we adopt the first concurrent resolution. To permit onethird of the Senate to insist on the spending limits set in that resolution would deny a majority the right to \"work its will.\" It could cause very serious disruptions in established programs. by forcing drastic reduction in socalled controllable programs when expenditures in other programs rise unexpectedly. It would subject the Congress to rigid set of procedures which are incompatible with its operating methods and with the prerogatives of a majority of the Senate.

I am quoting Richard Nixon who as a U.S. Senator spoke those words at the Hotel Statler in Boston on November 13. 1951. That speech has turned out to be prophetic and Parade magazine recently ran excerpts from it. Senator Nixon went on to blast the moral standards of this administration and the racketeers who get concessions on their income tax cases. The Senator did not always have substantiation for his charges. but he made them anyway. Today. seven high Nixon administration officialsincluding two former Cabinet officers and the two former chief Presidential advisersare under indictment. The income tax concessions in question today are those of the President himself. In 1951 Senator Nixon said: The great tragedy is not that corruption exists but that it Is defended and condoned by the President and other high administration officials. That speaks for itself.

The Pennsylvania Senate has passed a bill to make the fireflylightning bug. glowworm. or whatever you prefer to call itthe official insect of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Since I am not sure whether any other State has an official insect. it never bugged me that Pennsylvania might snatch the initiative and designate an official insect. The timeliness of the firefly as a State insect must be apparent to all of us and I am indebted to my former colleague. the Honorable Clyde Dengler. for introducing the measure at the behest of schoolchildren in his district. I think the firefly makes more sense as a State insect under present circumstances than. let us say. the locusta bane to our crops especially under todays conditionsor the gnatit takes bug repellant with a petroleum base to shoo it away. While the Pennsylvania House waits to act on making the firefly the official State insect. I thought the appropriateness of the selection should be noted. I am undecided on whether to dedicate these lyrics to my former colleagues in Harrisburg or to my dear friends in the Federal Energy Office.

DEAR NORMAN: I would like to call to your attention correspondence I have had with your office. and in particular. the most recent letter dated May 22nd. sined for you by Ray Gerard. In my opinion the response is most unsatisfactory and I cannot believe it reflects your personal point of view. particularly since you are one of the major supporters of my legislation to provide conjugal and family furloughs. That legislation is predicated on the need to try to maintain some female companionship for prisoners. To take the position that you will now ban all female guests on the basis that \"To have permitted female guest to travel the only available route to the staff dining hall would have left open the possibility of a disturbance. or at a minimum. the possibility of exprsirz any female guest to possible embarrassing comments by men in the population\" astonishes me. Such a statement assumes that prisoners as a group are r-.imals. Dont you think that if prisoners really understood that the attendance of femalestheir wives. sisters and sweetheartsat religious or other functions were subject to their good behavior under those social circumstances. they in fact. would do everything possible to keep that privilege? I do. There will. of course. be an occasion when some prisoner who would be a boor on the outside as well as on the inside. will engage in some \"very unfavorable remarks.\" but should such an isolated incident so adversely affect the whole prison population? I think not. All of us. yourself included. are constantly talking about the reform of the prison systemto remove the barbarismto dealwith the homosexual assaults occasioned by loss of female companionship. and finally. to develop prison programs which would permit work leaves during the day and the operation of half way houses. Does it make any sense to take a backward step. which this rule does In my judgment. when it prevents female guests from attending the few functions heretofore permitted at the Atlanta Prison? My interest in this matter far transcends the initial communication which related to possible antisemitism. It would appear that what is involved is not antisemitic. but antihuman. I urge you to reconsider the directive. Please do let me know your decision in this matter. Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the American ideal of freedom of choice is presently being threatened by severe financial pressures. The alternative of nonpublic education on the elementary and secondary levels is subject to rising costs and. hence. increased tuition. Increased tuition produces deflated enrollments. In the State of New York. alone. more than 800.000 children would flood the public schools if the nonpublic schools were to close. This would place a major additional burden upon the taxpayers and produce utter chaos in the schools. The tenet of churchState separation does not intend to exclude educational diversity in this country. In my opposition to the granting of direct aid to parochial and other private schools. I see: to preserve the stated principle. yet insure. through a tax credit system. the existence of alternatives. In the interest of continuing to make available the option of a nonpublic education. as well as keeping reasonable levels of taxation for the maintenance of our public school system. I urge the passage of tax credit legislation. This legislation would provide to the parents of children in nonpublic school a tax credit for a portion of the tuition which they pay. The proposed bill would allow those paying tuition to take a tax credit of 50 percent or $200. whichever is the lesser. Such credits would sustain the fundamental right of parents to select the form of education they desire for their children. Parents of nonpublic schoolchildren pay a double tax. They support. without debate. the public educational systems of their communities. In light of soaring costs. the Congress must ease the pressure on these families. If the nonpublic schools were to close. there would be an influx of at least 5.000.000 students into the public system at the estimated cost of $858 per child. For the financial and educational wellbeing of all Americans. I strongly advocate the enactment of tax credit legislation.",

The Occupational Outlook Handbook offers an overview of employment prospects in a wide range of occupations including foresters. aerospace engineers. teachers. railroad conductors. receptionists. State police officers.- and plumbers. Over 250 occupations are listed. The handbook also contains projections of changes that are expected to occur between 1970 and 1980.

Nonetheless. 8 out of every 10 jobs open will not require a college degree.

The overall bill covers approximately 370 individual line items. but my amendment will touch only 26. For those unfamiliar with the bill it would be rather difficult to determine precisely what effect our amendment would have by a simple printing of the text of the amendment. so I shall include prepared setting forth the specific items with figures showing the level of expenditure in the current fiscal year 1973. the Presidents budget figure for the item in fiscal year 1974. what was recommended by the full committee in the bill. the amount of my proposed amendment. and finally what the figure for the item would be if my package of amendments should be adopted. The explanation in the table for each reduction will be reduced to its briefest form. but we will of course have extensive arguments and explanations in support of our position during general debate and when the bill is read for amendment. I should say further. Mr. Speaker. that the manner in which I shall offer the amendment will be similar to that used by Mr. Joelson and Mr. HATHAWAY in years past when they offered packages of amendments to increase our bill.

Finally.

The Andrus Center. Mr. Speaker. is one of the largest gerontological institutions in the world. and it is dedicated to improving our understanding of the processes of aging. and the problems of the elderly. through support of research in the biological and social sciences as well as graduate training and community service programs. It seems to me that some words spoken at the dedication ceremony by Dr. John Hubbard. president of the University of Southern California. are of great significance to those of us interested in the elderly and research on their problems. Said Dr. Hubbard: The University of Southern California sees the study of aging as an area rich with information for the scientists and laden with promise for his fellow human being.

I do not agree with the offshore drilling concept. but there are some people who want to go offshore. The Federal Government itself could finance some of that. could set aside the areas for exploration and geophysical work. and find where those possible oil fields are. They could delineate them. Then they could turn around and talk to the major oil companies about bidding on them. and they could have tremendous royalties. something like 98 percent. from the oil companies.

I might point out. the first legislative act that I participated in after my election last March was the signing of a discharge petition to get this bill out on the floor so we could debate it and hopefully pass it. People aften ask me. what can Congress do about inflation. especially in the short time remaining in the 93d Congress? I have responded that one thing we certainly could do would be a very simple thing. It would take Just a few votes in the right committee so we could discuss and debate it: that would be the passage of the Elk Hills legislation. because as the gentleman has pointed out. that would greatly contribute to our economic stability. It would tend to reduce our unfavorable balance of trade and put us well ahead In the fight to secure independence. I have called for the opening of the Elk Hills Reserve almost from the day I was elected to Congress last March and I have cosponsored legislation to that effect. Both the Secretary of the Navy and the President have urged that production at Elk Hills be increased. and I believe that it is in the countrys immediate and longrange interests to open up the reserve to expanded production. Producing the reserve would help to replace the oil being taken from the civilian economy by the military. as it would free 7 /2 million gallons of fuel a day for domestic use. While I quite understand the reasons why the Elk Hills Reserve was originally established. the need today for a petroleum reserve is not the same as it was when the reserve was established early in this century. I feel that there are overriding matters of national concern that must be taken into consideration at this particular time in history and. further. any major conflict today would be resolved one way or the other long before the Navys need for oil became critical. Prompt action is needed on the Elk Hills issue to help alleviate the energy problems that confront the Nation today and I strongly urge that such action be taken.",

Already this legislation. introduced by Senator BAKER in the other body. has attracted 33 Senate cosponsors. and surely deserves our support in the House of Representatives. As Senator BAKER outlined on September 19 when he introduced the measure in the Senate. that: While a Joint Committee on Intelligence Oversight will provide increased assurance that the various intelligence and lawenforcement agencies are abiding by the Constitution and the Federal statutes by which they were created .... the committee also will strengthen our legitimate intelligence gathering capacity through insuring better coordination between the CIA.

It is my good fortune to live in the State of Arizona. a neighbor of the good people of Mexico. Mexico is a country that exemplifies what can take place in a Latin American country. Mexico is now one of the leaders of the Latin American countries. A stable economy now exists in Mexico. and we are looking forward to greater developments in the relations between these two great nations. This also holds for most of the other Latin American countries. We have had our differences with some of them. Perhaps we have not always taken full advantage of our opportunities there. However. It is certainly significant that we will be working with those countries that are developing their resources and that may be in a position to be of great assistance both to our country and to many other countries in the world. So I want to commend the Senator. I believe what he has said contributes meaning fully to what we are talking aboutways of solving our energy problem. I noted in the press this morning an article regarding the State of West Viginia. wherein there are coming to fruitionI think greatly due to the efforts of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia--the efforts he has been making as far as coal is concerned. It was brought out in the article that methane is now being taken from coal minesvery successfully. as I understand it. It bodes a good picture for the future in this regard. I was extremely impressed by the estimates made in the article. I knew of the potential as far as coal gasification and liquefaction were concerned. This is the first time I realized the full potential of methane from coal mines. We have a twofold objective in bringing about the beneficial use of that product. which I understand has been previously practically wastedcreation of safer mines and utilization of the methane gas. I want to commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. because he has been a leader in this field over the years. exemplifying what can be done if we take advantage of the potential of the coal reserves of this Nation.",

I have covered the windfall rebates. on which I have gone into detail. Section 112. standards for allocation. certainly needs reconsideration. The antitrust section is faulty and is very much in need of correction. The export controls section is unclear and not explicit.

The car pool section is one that also presents problems. The judicial review section has been questioned by a number of my colleagues.

I carefully followed the hearings and read the testimony. and it is clear that any individual any place in the United States who is aggrieved by a price charged to him by a filling station. any one of thousands all over this country. may then file a complaint with the Renegotiation Board. Then there will be before the Renegotiation Board an application for a refund for part of the price of 10 gallons or a hundred gallons of gasoline that were purchased by this individual. The Renegotiation Board has to decide whether it was an excess charge by an individual filling station at the retail level. Of course. the same is true of an individual complaint against a wholesaler or a producer of oil. It should be understood that this is not a tax.

Looking at these two Presidential actions. I am filled with a deep sense of injustice. What we have here is a case of misplaced priorities and distorted values. President Ford is asking that our Nation be lenient when it comes to draft dodgers and deserters but when it comes to assisting those who served in our Armed Forces. stricter sacrifices should be demanded of those who have served with honor. Our policy. however. should be exactly the opposite. Our Nation should be generous when dealing with our veterans and strict when dealing with those who willfully evaded military service.

Of all the nations in the world. certainly we Americans can well appreciate and sympathize with the Baltic peoples struggle for an independently free country. As the global champion of the democratic process. and the foremost examDecember .. 1974 ple of a free and open society. it is the duty of this great country to seize the initiative and employ the detente diplomacy. now established with the Soviet Government. to gain official recognition of the basic human rights for all these people. Surely we cannot shrink from this awesome responsibility. The American people know that. as moral defenders of liberty. justice. and selfdetermination for all. we must stand unalterably opposed to the Soviet policy of political. cultural. and religious persecution toward the captive peoples of the Baltic States. We will remain firm in our conviction to fight oppression in any form at any place. so that the ideals for which this Nation has struggled for nearly 200 years shall never be compromised to the forces of totalitarianism.",

That message is that Americans have had enough of doubledigit inflation. As a recent Harris poll has shown. 76 percent of the American people consider Government spending to be one of the prime causes of inflation. Of course. this opinion is correct. Government spending is a prime cause of inflation. One unbalanced budget has followed another. Interest payments on the public debt have soared. If each American family was presented a bill for the interest payments on the national debt for this year alone. the bill would be $429 per family. It is obvious that the budget must be balanced. There are basically two ways Cf doing this. One is to raise taxes and the other Is to cut spending. As I have said numerous times before. the problent is not undertaxing but overspending. The American people are fed up with new and higher taxes. In the State of Ohio alone there were over 300 local issues on the ballot dealing with higher tax levies and/or greater spending. The",

Only through the leadership of the Congress can these crises be met and policies for their solution formulated. While the consideration of our own individual constituents still remains the highest. priority. circumstances have extended our representation to the citizens of the world. In the name of humanity. we must stop the hunger and starvation in the world. But at the same time. the United States cannot expect the problems of the world to be solved unless we can solve the economic instability that faces our domestic economy. The Congress must reform the programs of agriculture. transportation. and foreign trade. and we must formulate programs for the elderly. medical services. and equitable tax laws. While these problems are difficult and at times seem impossible to solve. immediate action by the Congress can begin to quickly lessen their impact.

I believe that this bill is one of the most sensible steps that Congress can take to ease the tax burden on our citizens while doing something constructive about doubledigit inflation. and the housing shortage as well. As my distinguished colleagues on the Ways and Means. and Banking and Currency Committees have pointed out. this bill will not only encourage savings and reward thrift. but will give a lift to the housing industry as well. As the savings and loan institutions which finance new constructions receive increased deposits. they will be able to provide the cash for new homes and apartments. This. in turn. will help reduce Interest rates and also provide jobs in construction for many who are now unemployed. I have no doubt that the revenue generated by this bill will more than offset any loss that it occasions. The bill has so many merits that I hope this House grants it swift and overwhelming approval.

Mr. President. today the American Legion National Commander issued a statement on this subject. Commander James M. Wagonseller said: To allow draft evaders and military deserters to work in VA hospitals would be a direct insult to the Vietnam veterans who accepted and fulfilled the obligation of service during the Vietnam war. It would be especially shameful to have draft evaders serving at the bedside of men who were wounded in action. He pointed out that the unemployment rate for Vietnam veterans in the 2024 age bracket is currently 9.4 percentnearly twice the national unemployment rate of 5.4 percent. Commander Wagonseller noted: There are plenty of honorably discharged veterans who want and need any jobs that are available in VA hospitals. In addition to which. honorably discharged veterans are justly entitled to veterans preference in government hiring. Mr. President. the Legion earlier came out in opposition to the Presidents proclamation offering conditional amnesty to draft evaders and military deserters. At that time. the Legion said: The Proclamation violates the principles for which millions served their country honorably. thousands died in combat. thousands more were wounded. many are hospitalized. while others remain missing in action. It is appropriate to note the vigorous opposition of the American Legion to any effort to assign draft evaders and military deserters to perform alternate service in VA hospitals. The Legion represents 2.5 million veterans who have served honorably during wartime. Mr. President.

I am no expert in what constitutes a drug and what constitutes a health food. but I do recognize serious differences of opinion among Federal agencies which have responsibilities in this field. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed heavy regulations for the health foods industryregulations which can have the effect of sharply limiting the availability of health foods. These regulations fly in the face of a National Institutes of Health study which expresses concern about the lack of proper nutrition in the United States. especially among the elderly. On the other hand. FDA contends that it is a myth that major segments of the population of the Nation are now suffering or are in imminent danger of suffering from nutritional deficiency. The amendment before us now seeks to prevent the Food and Drug Administration from carrying out its determination to classify safe vitamin and mineral supplements as dangerous drugs and to regulate them under the drug provisions of the law rather than as foods or food supplements. A study at Duke University indicated that half of all psychiatric patients over 65 had \"borderline\" or worse nutritional status in at least one major food needed for the body and brain to function. The NIH survey showed \"abnormally low levels\" of vitamins and minerals among a random group of elderly men rich and poor. The effect of the proposed FDA regulations seems to indicate that certain vitamin and mineral supplements will be harder to get and be more expensive if the regulations are finally approved. I think this amendment should pass simply because the elderly people of this Nation have a large stake from a health point of view in the availability of vitaminmineral supplements and in what vitaminmineral supplements cost.",

This bill is our response to an arbitrary action by the Food and Drug Administration in attempting to regulate and restrict the sale and availability of vitamins and minerals. This bill stems from the FDAs effort to classify safe vitamin and mineral supplements as dangerous drugs and to regulate them as drugs rather than as the food supplements they in fact are. For the past 2 years. I have received a broad expression of concern from Oregonians over the FDAs actions. And a Federal court in New York has echoed those concerns by delaying the effective date of the FDAs proposed regulations. Although sustaining the FDAs broad authority to issue regulations standardizing vitamin and mineral supplements. the court ruled that the FDA may not prevent vitamins and minerals from which there is no established recommended daily allowance from being sold separately. included in general purpose foods. or sold as optional ingredients In dietary supplements. As my colleagues well understand. it is the standardization authority which is the object of our consideration today. Only with passage of S. 2801. today offered as an amendment to S. 3585. can we guarantee that the FDA will not limit the potency. number. combination. amount. or variety of any vitamin or mineral when the recommended amount is not injurious to health. This means that FDA will not be permitted to classify safe vitamins as \"drugs\" to be sold over the counter or by prescription. which would greatly increase the cost to the consumer. If the vitamin or mineral in the potency recommended is injurious to health. then FDA will of course have the authority to impose limitations. Mr. President. the issue boils down to this. As long as vitamins or minerals are nontoxic in the recommended quantities. and are accurately labeled. the FDA should not interfere. except to assure cleanliness. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment today to put the Senate clearly on record. and to encourage early House consideration of this issue.",
