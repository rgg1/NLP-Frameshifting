    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the President has refused to negotiate a balanced budget. just 17 days after signing an agreement to balance the budget in 7 years. There are three plans out there: His plan. which did not get one vote in the Senate. went down 96 to 0. then the Democrat Coalition plan. which did get some votes and does balance in 7 years. but the best plan is the Republican plan. The reason I believe so is because it has the discipline of a balanced budget. It will balance in 7 years. It is the right thing to do. We will never get there unless we have the discipline. Second. it deals with the tough issues like welfare reform. We believe it is the right thing for people to work for what they get. and not just get a handout. so they can believe in themselves. We trust States like Kansas to do what is right for those truly in need. The Republican plan also trusts parents by giving them a $500 per child tax break. It allows them to spend money on their children rather than the Government. It will strengthen families and it is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker. let us do the right thing for our country. for ourselves. and for our children. Let us balance the budget in 7 years.",

Mr. Speaker. in its current form. this bill eliminates two programs which promoted comprehensive and effective economic growth in disadvantaged communities--the community development financial institutions and the economic development initiative fund. -Through these programs. lowincome individuals were given the opportunity to start their own businesses. small children benefited from community centers that kept them off the streets after school. families gained access to safe and affordable housing and good business was generated for Americas financial services industry. Mr. Speaker. by eliminating these programs. we are launching a double assault on poor communities. In essence. we no longer reward those individuals who take responsibility for improving themselves and creating a better life for their children. while. we simultaneously remove incentives for financial institutions to invest in these communities as well. Mr. Speaker. we need to commend programs such as the CDFI and EDI fund because they do offer lowincome individuals a handup. not a handout. which I am sure my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can appreciate.

This is an absurd description of a program whose spending would grow 62 percent by 2002. He says that \"deep\" education cuts would \"undermine\" schools. But the budget barely touches the largest education programguaranteed college loansand all Federal aid to public schools provides only 7 percent of their spending. Newsweek is absolutely right.

Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee and Senators STEVENS. BURNS. and BREAUX. One of my goals in developing this legislation was to review current programs to see if they could be restructured while improving their functions. Over the last several months. I have heard people calling for major changes at the Department of Commerce. As Chairman of the Committee on Commerce. Science. and Transportation. I conducted a hearing on August 1. 1995. and invited Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown to testify. His comments. as well as others. have helped in developing a bill that answers that call. This bill downsizes bureaucracy. It consolidates duplicative programs. It transfers functions to other agencies that can manage them better. It terminates unnecessary programs. Overall. the bill is a 7percent decrease from the FY95 appropriations level of $1.95 billion and a 14percent decrease from the Administrations FY96 request. The mission of NOAA is to explore. map. and chart the global ocean and its living resources as well as to manage. use. and conserve these resources. to describe. monitor. and predict conditions in the atmosphere. ocean. sun. and space environments. to issue warnings against impending destructive natural events. to assess the consequences of inadvertent environmental modification over several scales of time. and to manage and disseminate longterm environmental information.

Federal appliance efficiency standards were established because manufacturers wanted one Federal standard as opposed to 50 different. and perhaps inconsistent. standards. The consumer benefits from the Codes and Standards Program. The program establishes minimum energy conservation standards for a variety of electrical components. electrical consumer goods and building codes. The effects of the Codes and Standards Program are significant. For example. new energy standards for clothes washers have the potential to save consumers up to twothirds of their current energy and water costs before the end of the decade. The appliance standards adopted to date will save consumers a net of $132 billion over the lifetime of the affected products. What is good for the consumer is good for the industry. The further benefits of this program are: The standards also decrease pressure on utilities to build new power plants. preserve precious natural fuel resources. promote greater water conservation in drought stricken states. make U.S. products more competitive in domestic markets against foreign competition. I know that the industry has raised significant criticisms of the Department of Energy. As a result. the Department has organized workshops and public meetings with manufacturers to work towards consensus. I support continuing a consensus approach to revising standards. Today. the Senate has accepted an amendment that will preclude the proposal. issuance. or prescription of rules on new or amended appliance and equipment standards for 1 year. After this limited time period for technical review. I urge my colleagues to remain firmly in support of the Codes and Standards Program.*",

This waiver is bad policy. it sets a bad precedent. it is legislation of a most unfortunate type on an appropriation bill. With this waiver. the FAA could ignore Federal personnel and procurement policies and create whatever policies it sees fit. It could pay as little or as much as it wants. create new pensions. ignore such laws as competition in contracting. Make no mistake. this waiver would result in serious controversy and litigation. Mr. President. Senator GLENN and I are the ranking member and chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. which is the committee of jurisdiction on personnel and procurement policies. We stand ready to work with the FAA in reforming these policies. as we believe reform is necessary. But. we have received no request for any such waiver from the FAA. In fact. last year. we gave the FAA authority to test waivers of procurement laws. But. this bill proposes a blanket exemption before we know the results of that test. Moreover. the GAO found the FAAs problems are not the procurement or personnel laws. but a lack of adequate management. The FAA cannot properly define what it wants to buy. estimate its costs. or administer its contracts. If the GlennRoth amendment fails. mark my words. today is the day that the Senate gives birth to the next major procurement horror story.

    "speech": "Mr. President. very briefly. I would like to indicate the reason the Appropriations Committee brought this language to the floor. This was at the behest of the FAA and the administration saying we have a crisis. a very serious crisis in air safety. because the FAA. as administrators. for years have said they needed to get some kind of change in these rules. Secretary Pefia and Administrator Hinson face this today. One example: The FAA is the worlds largest consumer of vacuum tubes and there is. in this bill. a requirement to use $7 million to buy more when the private sector has thrown this technology out 20 years ago. Consequently. we have to recognize that it is a safety factor that involves this language. We did not make up this language. Last night. there was discussion and debate saying. well. what is the role of the administration? We ought to get a clarification. Government Operations people said they have been ready to talk. Let me give you a recitation. We have a second letter. We had a letter from OMB supporting this. Secretary Pefia sends us a second letter reiterating the vital importance to give them this kind of support. DOT says they have talked to Governmental Affairs. DOT does support the committee provision. The National Performance Review. headed by Vice President GORE. specifically called for a special exemption for the FAA given its crisis situation. So it is a very clear picture here because of whateverI am not making any criticism to any committee. Senator LAUTENBERG and I have been following the support and the requests of the administration to help them out of this crisis for the sake of safety of our national airlines. Therefore. we will drop this language in conference if we can work out the solution. In the meantime. I urge that we vote to table the Roth amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. there is one issue that has been neglected in the debate over our tax bill: the issue of how this tax bill helps our Nations seniors. Remember President Clintons punitive tax hike on seniors? Remember when the Democrats decided that seniors living on fixed incomes as low as $34.000 were wealthy? Well. our bill injects some sanity back into this debate by repealing the Clinton tax increase on seniors. It lets seniors keep more of their own money rather than forcing them to hand it over to the Federal Government to be squandered by spendthrift bureaucrats. Our tax bill also helps seniors by reforming the Social Security earnings limit. Under current law. seniors between the ages of 65 to 69 can only earn $11.280 before the Government begins confiscating $1 for every $3 they earn. When you include the FICA withholding tax and the Federal income tax. lowincome seniors face an effective marginal tax rate of 55.65 percent. That is a tax rate traditionally left to millionaires. Unlike the Democrats. who once claimed that they wanted to see the earnings limit raised. we are doing what we said we would do by raising the earnings limit to $30.000. These provisions. plus our longterm care incentives. $500 eldercare tax credit and the increase in the estate and gift tax exclusion. show that it is the Republicans that are looking out for the best Interests of our Nations seniors. In my State of Nebraska. over 34.000 seniors will benefit directly from our senior citizen tax reforms. Not to mention how many thousands of other Nebraska seniors will benefit from our American dream savings accounts. spousal IRAs and capital gains reductions. Let us not forget that it was the Democrats who passed the largest tax increase in American history. They oppose H.R. 1215 because they want to raise taxes again. Here is a bill that helps out our Nations seniors. cuts taxes on all Americans. pays for those cuts. and lowers the deficit by $30 billion. Sounds like winwin public policy to me.",

It lowers capital gains. raises the earnings limit on Social Security. provides an adoption tax credit. an elder tax credit. IRA equity. a $500 tax credit for children. In short. it is a familyfriendly tax relief bill. After all. the family is the fundamental unit of society. It is the guardian of our social fabric. It is the means by which our values are conveyed. Yet it is besieged. embattled. It is under attack by its own government. We could not have come up with a more antifamily public policy if we had sat down and devised such a plan. It is not too much to expect that government be the friend. not the foe. of the family. so one critical step in turning this around is the passage of the $500 per child tax credit. It would shift power and money from Washington bureaucrats and return it to the moms and dads of middle America. Families do not want more entitlements. they want empowerment. The American family is tired of highsounding rhetoric and empty speeches about family values while policymakers insult them by saying \"We cant afford it now.\" as if it is our money. We cannot afford not to do it now. Our national security is intertwined with family security. Strong and secure families mean a strong and secure society.

Taxpayers have to pay for government spending. so when we talk about how are we going to pay for tax cuts. we are just going to allow the American people to keep more of what they earned. In reference to a little while ago. we heard about Ronald Reagan raising taxes up to 50 percent on Social Security recipients back in 1983. Let me remind the Members also of which party was in control of the Committee on Ways and Means and which party was in control of the Congress at that time. It was the Democrats. I have a lot of seniors in my district. Those seniors have been telling me that they thought that the 1993 raise on their Social Security benefits. tax raise on their Social Security benefits. was unfair. I agree with them. They have earned this money. The tax raise in 1983 went to bail out Social Security. The tax raise in 1993 did not go to bail out Social Security. What we need to do is we need to be fair to our seniors. We need to raise as this bill does the earnings limit up to $30.000. I had people working for me that would come to me and say. \"You know. I just cant work anymore because Ill go over my earnings limit and that will hurt me as far as my Social Security money is concerned.\" It used to break my heart. These people wanted to be productive and we would not be able to allow that because of the tax system that we have set up. We need to give working seniors a break and this bill does that.

The tax incentives for longterm care and also allowing life insurance to come out earlier are important benefits for senior citizens. I think when seniors look beyond the empty rhetoric and look at the concrete steps that will benefit them and benefit the things that they need to see happen in their later years. they will see this is real happen in their later years. they will see this is real concrete action that will make a big difference in their lives.",

Mr. Chairman. one of the things that we hear repeatedly from the opposition side of the aisle is that somehow this Republican tax plan is going to hurt those who are already less well off than others. the poorer folks in the United States. We have heard it over and over again and it did not just start today. It has been going on for some time. I call those of you who use that line revisionists. revising the history of the 1980s just as some people in this country would revise the history of World War II. kind of the same thing. Let me give an example. A speaker earlier today talked about what happened to the bottom fifth of the wage earners in our country during the 1980s and they said that they were less well off in 1990 than they were in 1980. That is true. But you do not say why. As a matter of fact. in 1979 when our President was not a Republican. the bottom fifth on average earned a level at about $9.800. During the next several years. ending in 1982. that level of income for the bottom fifth of our wage earners plummeted so that by 1982. it was way down here at about $8.400. Then Republican tax policy changes took place in 1981. 1982. and 1983. Look at what happened to the average wage level of the bottom fifth of our wage earners. It went up dramatically. Not quite to $9.800. but almost. It grew rapidly. Then we go off this chart in 1990. we had a tax increase. and in 1993 we had another tax increase. If this chart were uptodate. you would see this yellow line shoot back down again because we increased taxes. hurt the economy. and had the most dramatic effect on our lowwage earners.

So what we have done is we have paid for emergency spending. we are providing tax relief. and we are going to continue to slow the growth of Federal spending so that we actually do get to a balanced budget. That is a record that we will be proud of. That is a record of accomplishment. And that will be a record of equity. fair distribution between the American people and slowing the growth of the Federal Government.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the bill. Mr. Chairman. this vote is not about tax cuts. It is about priorities. It is about Intergenerational equity. It Is about whether we. as a nation. can In good conscience reward ourselves with tax cuts today. while laying upon our children the burden of massive. bloated deficits stretching as far as the eye can see. That is not right. Mr. Chairman. While I commend my colleagues. Representatives CASTLE. UPTON. and MARTINI. for their concerted efforts to link tax cuts to deficit reduction. I do not believe that the commitment they have secured goes far enough. No commitment. however well Intentioned. can ensure that Congress will meet its deficit reduction goals. Recent budget agreements have certainly taught us that. Yet we know that the pressure to maintain these very expensive tax cuts will only Increase with time. regardless of whether or not we are on the deficit reduction glidepath specified in this agreement. That is a very. very slippery slope to embark upon. Mr. Chairman. I. too. support many of the individual tax provisions contained within this package. but the rule does not permit us to consider these tax provisions individually. On the contrary. we are being asked to cast one vote on a massive tax bill whose price tagnearly $700 billion in the next decadeis staggering. As a result. in this case. the whole Is less than the sum of its parts. Finally. Mr. Chairman. I would like to voice my strong objections to the leaderships unwillingness to permit amendments that would direct the child tax credit to middleincome families. rather than to those earning up to $250.000. The lack of a reasonable cap on the child credit is particularly troubling considering that this legislation actually raises taxes on over 2 million Federal employees to finance everyone elses tax cut. an egregious inequity that I have already discussed on this floor several times today. I urge my colleagues to keep their contract with future generations and to put deficit reduction. tax fairness. and equity for our Nations civil servants first. Vote against this package.",

I am referring to the flexible endoscopic procedures performed by physicians. Currently. there are two types of flexible endoscopes available to physicians to perform these procedures: One is a conventional endoscope that is manually cleaned and disinfected. The other is a redesigned endoscope which incorporates the use of a sterile protective covering called the EndoSheath. Using the EndoSheath protects the patient and health care provider from the risks associated with crosscontamination. I am very concerned by the contamination risks associated with the use of impure patientready endoscopes on veterans. As such. it is important to ensure that the Veterans Health Administration is aware of and encouraged to explore the overall effectiveness of the singlepatient. sterile. condomlike protective coverings that may help protect veterans from the risk of crosscontamination.",

This amount reflects a $3.9 million increase from fiscal year 1996. and a $10 million increase above the administrations budget request. I understand that the Senate proposal did not include a funding increase for NASAs academic programs. I support increased funding for this valuable program. This will allow NASA to fund ongoing programs as well as fund new innovative programs. One such program involves a science education program developed by Hawaiis Bishop Museum. NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin has indicated his personal support for this program which involves the creation of two dynamic multimedia planetarium programs and associated educational materials around the theme of exploration. The \"Journey by Starlight\" program is an interactive simulation of navigating a Hawaiian canoe from Tahiti to Hawaii. The \"Eyes of the Universe\" program will focus on modern technology and human exploration of the universe from earth and spacebased observatories. particularly those in Hawaii. Using various distribution techniques. it is estimated that at least 800.000 students and 500.000 families and nontraditional students across the Nation will experience these programs. Complementing the planetarium programs will be educational curricula for grades 3 through 12. an interactive and evolving World Wide Web site. video resources. and an interactive CDROM. Mr. President. it is my hope that during the HouseSenate conference you will support increased funding for NASAs academic programs and give consideration to the joint initiative between NASA and Hawaiis Bishop Museumn.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to say a few words today relative to an effort being undertaken by veterans and local community organizations to protect and preserve land adjacent to the Los Angeles National Cemetery. This land. 44 acres. was deeded as a gift to the Federal Government provided that its use would be for veterans. It is hoped that the land can be preserved so that as the need for veterans cemeteries grows. this land. which is adjacent to the Los Angeles National Cemetery. will be a valuable resource to the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is my understanding that there have been requests of the DVA to lease this land for commercial development. including its use as the site for an NFL stadium. This has raised concerns by veterans and local communities as to the appropriate use of this land so close to a national cemetery where families and veterans go to honor their loved ones. Local organizations are willing and able. through private resources. to develop this land as a park honoring our Nations veterans. This proposal. in keeping with the intent of the gift of land. complements the existing cemetery and protects the land for future veterans use. I have received letters from the American Legion. the California Department of Veterans Affairs. and officials of numerous veterans organizations in the State expressing their support for this effort. I would ask that the committee include language in Its conference report directing the Department of Veterans Affairs to work with these organizations to develop the land into a veterans memorial park and to prohibit the Department from entering into any longterm. binding leases which would tie the use of that land into one inconsistent with the intent of its donor. I applaud the local veterans. the California veterans groups. the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs both in Los Angeles and Washington. DC. and the local citizens groups for working together to arrive at an approach to protect this land for veterans now and in the future",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I support Senator BONDS amendment. It starts to address the serious problem with section 8. A large number of housIng projects. or housing programs. are subsidized by rents that far exceed the rent in a given area. In 1997 alone. over 2.100 of these section 8 contracts with nearly 132.000 units will expire. The Government cannot afford to continue paying these excessive rents indefinitely. This is almost like a Ponzi scheme. which is to come on in and get an FRA mortgage to build it. But in order to sustain the mortgage at inflated rents so you dont default. you need section 8 contracts. Well. we are heading for a financial disaster in three ways. No. 1. this could become an incredible taxpayer liability if all this begins to cascade in default. No. 2. we cannot continue to pay rents above market value. nor should we. No. 3. what we find is that we have an incredible number of these section 8 contracts coming due over the next 3 to 5 years. We must get a handle on the problem. Senator BONDs approach is a very. very reasonable approach. It is a demonstration project. It gives a variety of tools to the local area to resolve this. because so much housing in a national program is locally set. The market value in Utah of section 8 is remarkably different than in the San Francisco area or the Seattle area. So we think it is a very good approach. I think the Bond amendment begins a process that enables us to begin to. in a reasonable. rational. wellpaced way. begin to move on this. We cannot ignore the fact that over 850.000 units with subsidy problems are in the pipeline. Now is the time to act. I look forward to additional debate on this amendment. but I look forward to supporting this amendment. Most of all. I support beginning the process of getting a real grip on this issue.

And why might not a landlord simply walk away from a soft second mortgage? After satisfying the obligation of the next contract period over which the original mortgage is written down and rents are sufficient to provide a profit ostensibly to those property holders. why would they not walk away from a soft second mortgage?

There is a proposal from HUD that the writedown include funds sufficient to pay any tax liabilities. I do not agree with that. I do not think that in the housing business we should change the tax implications. But there are very serious tax implications If they walk away. The second mortgage is one which does not require payments in the initial years while the first mortgage is being paid off. To address the deferred maintenance. the owners will have access. for the first time. to residual sums which had been set aside in the past for maintenance. and by converting a portion of the debt on the project to the soft second and freeing the owners from the responsibility of paying that portion. paying current debt service on that portion. that will free up money for the deferred maintenance.

Some excessive costs have resulted from some of the Federal regulations and standards. which could be characterized as onerous. that applied to these projects. Other costs are due to the very difficult areas where the projects were being built. They were trying to get people into areas where you would not normally build multifamily housing. This included going into rural areas where there is elderly population. or projects in depressed inner city areas where costs of construction were very high. Some of the multifamily housing in this portfolio represents the onlyor certainly the best standard housing in many areas. or the only housing available to lowincome families.

Timlin will celebrate the Pontifical Celebration Mass of Thanksgiving In honor of the churchs centennial. According to historical documents. the church was founded when a group of Polish immigrants separated from another local parish to form the Holy Trinity Church. The cornerstone of the original church was laid on May 4. 1885. Rev. Francis Hodur. Holy Trinitys first pastor. led the church for 2 years. Seven different pastors served the church in the 20 years following Father Hodur. In 1919 Father Roman Wieziolowski began 48 years of service at Holy Trinity Church. Under his leadership a brick school with eight classrooms was built in 1923 and 3 years later. construction of the present church was begun. Five years later the church was completed at a cost of $225.000. By then. the parish had 1.000 families and the school was always filled to capacity. In 1967 Father Walter Poplawskl. who had served as an assistant under Father Wieziolowski. was appointed Pastor. Under his guidance repairs and modernization were undertaken to meet the liturgical renewal. Father Poplawskl considered Catho!ic education a priority during his leadership at Holy Trinity and worked with other area pastors to merge the Nanticoke area Catholic schools Into a central school system. which became the Pope John Paul II School. This newly formed school. which Is housed at Holy Trinity and St. Stanislaus Churches. still serves the youth of the Nanticoke area. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to have the opportunity to bring the history of Holy Trinity to the attention of my colleagues. An integral part of the religious community of northeastern Pennsylvania.

It is no great secret that while the private sector has increased its efficiency by downsizing and decentralizing. the Federal Government remains saddled with an archaic procurement system that Is expensive to operate and laden with paperwork and bureaucracy. The system as it is. forces taxpayers to pay a 20percent premium on Federal purchases. This is not responsible government. If we are to balance the Federal budget. it is our responsibility in Congress to make the procurement process an efficient and costeffective one. The taxpayers deserve it.

In celebration of the librarys 30th birthday. the Chevy Chase Historical Society Is setting up three displays that depict the town of Chevy Chase as far back as the turn of the century. The library also Is collecting pictures and momentos from citizens that will recreate the Chevy Chase community as it was In The library has changed since its opening on September 22. 1965. At the time. everyone wondered how they were ever go:ng to fill all of the empty shelves. Now the library is overflowing with books and \"bursting at the seams.\" according to Kathie Melzner. the agency head of Chevy Chase Ubrary. Over the years. the library has provided programs and activities for young children and their families. The library has been a resource for parents In the community. enabling them to become participants rather than observers In their childrens education. On a daily basis. the staff of the library responds to the needs of the diverse Chevy Chase community. helping people obtain access to meaningful Information vital to good decision making. The library has record of dedicated service to Individuals with special needs. individuals from the business and Industry sector. govemment and community leaders. and senior citizens. The biggest change at the Chevy Chase Ubrary has evolved In response to the challenges of the information age. The library Is no longer an isolated resource center In a small town. it Is now connected to other local libraries and to libraries In other Slates and countries. In September of 1965. President Johnson was urging Congress to grant home rule to Washington. DC. More troops were sent to Vietnam. On Broadway. Ginger Rogers was starring in \"Hello Dollyl.\" and Art Camey and Walter Matthau were \"The Odd Couple.\" In Montgomery County. MD. the Chevy Chase Library first opened its doors. Mr. Speaker. I congratulate the Chevy Chase Library on its 30th birthday. and I wish the staff. the volunteers. and the citizens of the Town of Chevy Chase continued success.",

On August 31. 1995. Chief Minister Beant Singh. a leading advocate of peace In the Punjab region. was viciously assassinated by Sikh terrorists. Mr. Speaker. the time has come for every Member of this House to condemn these violent acts perpetrated by Sikh militant factions. Unfortunately. some of our colleagues have chosen to carry the banner for the Sikh militants in Punjab by working closely with the socalled Council of Khalistan. Perhaps this latest tragic act will be enough to convince those Members that support for groups that promote violence only begets further violence. Responsible Members of this House must condemn each and every terrorist act perpetrated by these militants. We must also challenge our colleagues who support the Council of Khallstan because it benefits their own domestic political needs to realize that their support for the council is furthering a terrorist agenda in India. While fighting terrorist. Chief Minister Singh also worked simultaneously to bring the people of Punjab back into the mainstream political democracy upon which the nation of India prides Itself. Mr. Singh was duly elected by the people of Punjab in 1992 and he dedicated his life to maintaining democracy. Mr. Speaker. as the relationship between our country. the worlds oldest democracy. and India. the worlds democracy. continues to flourish and expand. let us support unequivocally the advocates of peace In Punjab.

The parsh was founded in 1970 by a few Slavic people with a vision and love for their Byzantine Rite. Many of the founders were first generation Americans who wanted a place to worship In the traditions of their Slavic ancestors. Since that time the parish has grown and become an Integral part of the community and serves over 300 families of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds who live in the Washington metropolitan area. In 1973. the construction of Epiphany Byzantine Catholic Church was completed and on April 29 was dedicated. Father John Danilak who served as pastor at that time wrote the following to parishioners: \"The erection of this beautiful edifice shall ever by a living testimonial of the generations of the unborn. and it will be a memorial to of your ardent faith and an inspiration for your children to manifest the Godgiven faith and the glorious heritage that you will entrust to them. May the doors of the Epiphany Church be always open to all who seek the soothing balm of Christs healing graces and that there be charity and love for the helpless. and that Epiphany serve as a reservoir of moral strength for the weak. a sanctuary for the oppressed and comfort and consolation for the aged and forgotten.\" Since those words were wntten In 1973. Epiphany Byzantine Catholic Church has strived to fulfill this commitment. The parish has grown and people of different cultures and backgrounds attend and participate In the religious services. Yet. the goals set In 1973 remain unchanged. Epiphany Byzantine Catholic Church continues to nurture its family In the gospel of Jesus Christ. through the unique genius of the Byzantine Rite. In 1987. the multipurpose parish center was dedicated and serves as a place for parishioners and the community to meet for educational and social events. The parish not only continues traditions of the Slavic people but also the ethnic and cultural traditions of their parents and grandparents. Epiphany Parish is truly committed to the Byzantine Catholic Rite and welcomes all who desire to worship with them. Mr. Speaker. I know my clleagues join me in honoring the Epiphany Byzantine Catholic Church on the occasion of its 25th anniversary.",

When the Republicans cut $270 billion from Medicare and use most of that to give tax breaks to the wealthiest handful of Americans. those cuts will make Medicare too expensive for many seniors who will have no place to turn for help except to their adult children.

Just 1 year ago. the Violence Against Women Act was passed in the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. Yet today. the funding allocation for these programs has been reduced so drastically that it would cripple or eradicate many of the programs so recently created to address the needs of poor and abused women. Programs covered under this funding Include training for law enforcement and judiciary officials on violence Issues and programs to address the serious problems of stalking and campus sexual assault against women. How can we be satisfied with the efforts we have made to promote and address the problem of violence against women when the committee cannot see fit to fund adequately these necessary programs? This bill as written sends a clear message to the Nation that this Congress does not take violence against women seriously. Women In danger of violence or sexual assault need our compassion. not deaf ears. I urge my colleagues to support Congresswoman LOWEYs amendment and to go on record with your commitment to the safety of Americas women. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment offered by Mr. MOLLOHAN to H.R. 2076. the Commerce. Justice. State appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. This amendment will provide much needed funds for community policing grants authorized by the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994. The programs that we authorized last summer are aimed at preventing crime In our communities and have been supported by the mayors. police chiefs. and law enforcement officials throughout our country. Mr. Chairman. it Is Important to acknowledge that the fight against crime requires more than simply adding prison space or new classes of punishment. It requires that we demonstrate the courage to champion the Innovative programs which provide alternatives to drugs. gangs. and the random acts of violence which afflict our society.

My bill already provides more resources than ever before to all State and local agencies to fight crime. We have already increased Byrne grants by $25 million over 1995. and what the administration requested. Between the almost $2 billion local block grant program. and the $475 million Byrne formula grant program that I proposed. every State will receive approximately 51/2 times more money to fight crime than they received this year. 5 times more. But for some States and local communities. addressing crime also means addressing the serious problems of illegal immigration. because often illegal immigration brings along with it other illegal criminal activities. As my colleagues well know. along with addressing crime in our bill. we include a serious commitment to addressing the problem of illegal immigration. Our initiative Is not only focused on controlling the borders. it is equally focused on addressing the growing population of deportable illegal aliens and is heavily weighted on the criminal illegal alien population. Mr. Chairman. I agree that we should not just give money to the States to reimburse them for the costs they are incurring without having a strong plan to address the underlying problem. This is a Federal responsibility and we are responsible for getting it under control. This bill. and the resources included in 1994 and 1995. provided during times when the subcommittee was under the watch of the gentleman from West Virginia. will significantly strengthen our ability to address illegal immigration. Our hope is that States burdens will decline as our efforts are successful in dealing with this problem. My bill attempts to address the costs that States bear as a result of crimes committed by aliens. The Department of Justice tells me that these resources will be available to all States based on the level of incarcerated illegal aliens. Mr. Chairman.

DARE is a good example of a partnership that unites parents. teachers. students. and police to keep our kids off drugs. When I was in the Sterling Heights DARE class some time ago. I saw a young officer with enormous energy who had developed personal rapport with the kids in his class. DARE means a lot to the children in my home communities. It also supports multijurisdictional task forces which unite law enforcement from all levels: county. State. and local. Criminals do not respect city limits. so these partnerships. like our local Combined OaklandMacomb Enforcement Team. otherwise known as COMET. and our Narcotics Enforcement Team. otherwise known as NET. enable our law enforcement officials to pool resources and information across city lines. Last year. my friends. the gentleman from Michigan and the gentleman from New York . and I gathered support of over 150 Members from both sides of the aisle in support of this program. I understand the need and Federal responsibility for criminal illegal alien Incarceration. There is an increase here of 250 percent. So. as a matter of priorities I believe we can afford this modest increase in Byrne without losing anything vital in our commitment to assiting the States with criminal illegal alien incarceration.

Now we have the Byrne grant. which gives us 26 different programs. including illegal aliens. So this is all kinds of flexibility you want. and now you say. \"No. let us not do that. let us keep all the money in one pot for illegal aliens.\" We are asking for 10 percent. or $30 million. of a $300 million pot to be used for the Byrne memorial grant which can be used for 26 different programs. which can be used with all the flexibility you need. My colleague from Michigan. Mr. LEviN. spoke of DARE. In my district we do bake sales and pancake breakfasts to fund the DARE program. We are asking for a little help for the DARE program. In my district. which has 23.000 square miles. we have undercover drug teams. which is a combination of Federal. State. and local officers. the same team. the TNT team. the Hunt teams. the upset teams. They do undercover drug work with the Byrne grant money. The arrests have gone up by 400 percent because of the cooperative efforts we have here. We could not do it without the Byrne Memorial grant. What we are asking for underneath the Mollohan amendment is take 10 percent. $30 million of the $300 million. put it in the Byrne grants. and it still leaves $270 million for incarceration of illegal aliens. In Michigan that means $1 million more we have to work with under the DARE program and undercover drug teams. The Mollohan amendment makes sense from a law enforcement point of view. It makes sense for 49 of the 50 States in the Nation. Our No. 1 priority in this country is crime and crime fighting. Here is a program that works. with all the flexibility you wanted yesterday.

I rise in opposition to the amendment of the gentleman from West Virginia. which would eliminate $30 million earmarked for reimbursing States for incarcerating violent criminal aliens. Earlier this year the House passed H.R. 667. the Violent Criminals Incarceration Act of 1995. In that legislation was a provision sponsored by this Member which would authorize $650 million per year to reimburse States for the burden of incarcerating illegal aliens that commit felonies. In the bill before us today. there is only $500 million set aside for that purpose and this amendment would reduce this amount by another $30 million. Mr. Chairman. the States can no longer afford to pick up the tab for the failure of the Federal Government to enforce its borders and enforce its immigration laws. For some perspective. the cost of this failure to California alone is over $500 million a year. But this is not only a California problem. There are over 4 million illegal aliens in our country and they are found in every State. Clearly. the States that are negatively impacted by this failure of Federal policy can no longer pay the bill for the fact that the Federal Government has shirked its responsibility to enforce its border and the law. I would just like to make one statement in relation to the gentleman from West Virginia: California gets less money per capita than any other State in the Nation as it relates to reimbursement for the incarcerating of illegal aliens under this legislation.",

Listen to the items that ABC Home Health Care put on their Medicare tab: Maid service payments for condominiums. golf pro shop expenses. airplane and automobile expenses for personal trips. and lobbying expenses. They use promotional and marketing gimmicks such as gourmet popcorn. golf tees. earrings. cufflinks. combs. and sewing kits to recruit new members. This is not a club but a home health care service. We should all be concerned. Taxpayers are footing the bill for these luxury items. Money was no object because ABC Home Health Care put it on the Medicare tab. Medicare was billed to the tune of $14 million for just 1 year. We cannot allow this to happen. this fraud to continue in the Medicare Program.",

Let me say this: America does not need to go bankrupt trying to effect some social reforms in China. Let us look at the record. China has been convicted of dumping in American markets. placing phony \"made in America\" labels on cheap Chinese imports. violating international prison labor law. violating United States copyright law. closing Chinese markets. and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Their average wage is 17 cents an hour. They still employ slave labor. Let us look at some facts. Right now China enjoys a oneway street. a $37 billion trade surplus with America. second only to Japan. At least Japan makes us some promises. China makes us threats. China says if you mess with MFN. they will crack down on soybeans. corn. aircraft. grain. They will not tolerate it. Unbelievable. ladies and gentlemen. I believe that a Congress that will allow China to dictate trade terms is the same Congress that has destroyed many American jobs. Let us talk some business. How do you compete with foreign imports with a wage factor so limited and low? Then they rip off our markets illegally and we extend the red carpet treatment. talking about all the great business we are going to attain. This is a dream world. The Constitution is very clear on this: Congress shall regulate commerce with foreign nations. One of the main problems financially in America is the Congress of the United States talking about balanced budgets and all of these other sideline issues and missing the whole boat. You cannot balance the budget of the United States buying much more than you sell. That In what we are doing. and it is our trade problem. folks. I am going to oppose any more mostfavorednation trade status for China for one reason: They do not deserve it. It is time to regulate trade with China. One last thing. ladies and gentleman.

We can do that. and we can also have MFN status with China. This country exports more than $9 billion a year of goods to China. That is close to 200.000 Jobs in this country. If we do not have MFN status with China. that will be only one of eight countries with which we have no MFN status with in the entire world. Last year. I spent an entire day with Counsel General Wang Li from China in the 16th district in Illinois. which has 1.500 factories. He told me there are 300 cities in China that have in excess of I million people. Seventyfive percent of those cities do not have an airport. and he said that China is in the process of building over 200 airports. This is the time to expand our trade with China. Look what happened this past week. China signed a $1 billion agreement with MercedesBenz in a Joint partnership to build the minivan in China. That could have been signed with Chrysler. and I hope one day eventually that will happen. What we have to do is to keep open the channels of communication. To deny MFN status would be to close that avenue. President Nixon said in a letter to President Bush in 1989. that \"in the current emotion of the moment our Nation seem to be forgetting an important point: A modernized. unified. and effectively governed China that has good relations with us is by far the preferred solution for advancing American security interests in East Asia.\" It was true in 1989. it is true in 1995.

I served a mission for my church in Taiwan from 1977 to 1979.

Many of them watched their parents be severely punished. sometimes beaten. sometimes even killed. for praying in public. As China engaged the Western world. I was heartened. I was encouraged. by her desire to become more open politically. economically. and socially. But as with many Americans. much of that optimism was extinguished by Tiananmen Square. and part of me died that day. Since that day China has steadily marched backward. stifling freedom. flouting human rights. and demonstrating disregard. I do support doing business with China.

But. while this is an important issue for the United States to pursue. it Is not the only issue at stake and I firmly believe we will not and cannot improve human rights by revoking MFN. As you know. on May 26. 1994. President Clinton announced his decision to delink human rights issues in China from the extension of MFN. By Executive order. later endorsed by Congress. the President proposed a policy of broad. comprehensive engagement with China. The Presidents decision. which I fully support and applaud. recognizes the fact that denying China MFN status will not prompt Chinese leaders to improve human rights conditions. In the short term. it will only harm the economies of both the United States and China. In the long term it would give European and Japanese businesses a competitive advantage. allowing them greater access to Chinas huge market of 1.2 billion people.",

But I believe it would be a mistake to isolate China from the world community through actions such as denial of MFN. China is experiencing tremendous turmoil. Its government is in transition. Its market economy continues to expand. which I believe will lead to an inevitable clash between the freedom of the market and the lack of freedom in Chinas political system. We must do everything we can to ensure that when that clash occurs. freedom wins--freedom in the marketplace and freedom at the ballot box. I believe that constructive economic engagement with the people of China will encourage such freedom.

I rise in support of H.R. 2058. the BereuterWolf bill which sets forth a clear policy on China by the Congress. and requires the President to report back to Congress every 6 months on the progress China is making toward achieving democracy as we reward them with MFN status. It sets forth international standards of conduct on nuclear proliferation. international standards on human rights. and the lack of access to their markets. Last year Members of Congress were told that the. provision of most favored nation [MFN] for China would give an incentive to Chinese leaders to be responsible with respect to how they treat their citizens and address the trade deficit. Since then. thousands of Chinese have been wrongfully imprisoned and persecuted and the Chinese leadership has continued to prevent freedom of association. speech. and religion. Although China is going through political and social changes. its leaders must know that the United States stands firm in our defense of the basic principles upon which our democracy was foundedfreedom of speech. freedom of religion. and freedom of affiliation. The detention of Harry Wu. an American citizen and a Hoover Institute scholar from Stanford University. which I am privileged to represent. and a globally recognized human rights leader is the most recent example of how oppressive the Chinese Government is. This resolution addresses the significant economic inequities which exist between our two countries. In 1989 the trade deficit was $6 billion. today it is closer to $40 billion. Our trade deficit with China will exceed our trade deficit with Japan in the next few years if we do not forge a Clear policy to deal with it. But the most valuable export our great Nation has is democracy and the best lesson in democracy we can give the world are the standards upon which our democracy rests and celebrates.

Cook County is a perfect example. where the city of Chicago under the formula in the bill gets some $30 million. as I understand it. and that is because the crime rate in Chicago is high. However. the housing of the prisoners. the prosecution of the prisoners and all that administration costs belongs to Cook County. So Cook County gets $200.000 and the city of Chicago gets $30 million. Now. justice is served if both Cook County. and I might add the administration of Cook County and the administration of Chicago are very friendly. if both the county and the city apply together and the State attorney general determines that this anomaly exists so there is that protection. then the money is more evenly distributed and appropriately distributed as agreed to between the parties. So this recognizes an anomaly. It is an effort to establish some equity and balance. This situation in Chicago and Cook County obtains in many other places around the country.

Using part 1 violent crimes. again as defined by the FBI. is probably the best overall way that anyone can come up with for such an allocation. but it is by no means perfect. and it may omit certain kinds of situations. in particular the one that is being addressed in this amendment right now where the higher number of crimes are in one jurisdiction and. therefore. the criminal activity is there and presumably the police department or sheriffs department is most active there. but another unit of government has responsibilities for those criminal cases generated by arrests that might occur. either housing in a county jail before trial or prosecuting the cases.

If those cities utilize that for police. the administration of justice will be impaired. In the case of smaller cities. it would be 400 percent. So I think this is targeted to a problem. Perhaps it is not the perfect solution. but it is the solution we were able to come up with. It is only when the counties bear the cost of prosecution and incarceration.

Mr. Chairman. this amendment merely sets aside $5 billion in a separate block grant for the prevention programs formerly authorized in the 1949 crime bill but does not specify funding levels for each program. Local governments can choose which program is best for them. Only 20 percent of last years crime bill. that is $6 billion of the $30 billion total went for prevention programs. But the new majority cut $21/a billion here in favor of more prisons. So what we are doing is creating a prevention program worth $5 billion in a separate block grant restoring each and every one of those that were struck in the 1994 crime bill. This is a more cost effective approach because the prevention programs are essential to dealing with crime on the front end of the problem. nourishing the health growth of communities. and study after study shows that this dose of prevention will now avoid the most costly police courts and prisons that later come on. Let us look at the data of just a few of them. The drug treatment program: A July 1994 study of the cost of treating 150.000 participants in drug treatment programs in California found benefits in a ratio of $7 in benefits for every $1 spent. Criminal activity declined by twothirds. alcohol and drug use by twofifths and health care costs by onethird. Recreational programs in Phoenix. AZ. crime was cut in half by keeping recreation centers open until 2 a.m. In Fort Myers. FL. juvenile arrests dropped 28 percent when the city built a new recreational center in a lowincome area. The costs of these programs is often as low as an amazing 60 cents per participant. President Bush selected one of the programs. midnight basketball in College Park. MD for one of the 1.000 Points of Light Program. Gang intervention programs in Spokane. WA helped steer juveniles away from gangs while offering constructive alternatives. The list goes on and on. but we want to eliminate once and for all the simplistic notion that all prevention programs are wasteful. We repeal them in favor of a nostrings block grant that we think will effectively reach some accommodation between the 1994 crime bill and the 1995 proposal that is before us in this bill.

A watershed moment for me was a year ago October when I took my thirdgrader to school and they had found a dead body across the street. and the perpetrator was still loose. and I knew that if we did not do something different in this country that my children would not be safe and the other children would not be safe. I knew something then. and I know it today. that part of the answer is prevention. As my mother used to tell me. and as our mothers told us all. an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We know that there is a Federal interest in safety or else we would not be doing this crime bill at all. and I think it is important that prevention of crime be part of this package throughout the country. You know. when children get off on the wrong track early. we know they are going to got in trouble. We know they are going to cause pain to victims and their families. and we know that there is something. sometimes very littie things. that we can do with children when they are 5 or 6 or 7 so that they will get on the right track. Those are the investments to make. I believe that every locality needs to make them. I am a firm believer in local government and. in fact. I am not offended by much of the block grant nature of this bill and said so during the Committee on the Judiciary hearings. Nevertheless. I think we ought to let localities know who are going to participate in this Federal program that some section of that must be used for prevention. Lot them use their own creativity. Let them meet local needs. But we need to prevent crime. because a child who is going to become a monster in Nebraska today could be in San Jose. CA. tomorrow. threatening my children.",

During one period of my career I was a specialist in the prosecuting of what we call whitecollar crimes. frauds. embezzlements. and so forth.

As a result. they defrauded the public. they embezzled from their employer. they committed all kinds of crimes. not necessarily as crude as robbing a convenience store at gunpoint. but the intent to steal was just as glaring. The problem Is this amendment does not allow. in the words of the gentlewoman from Virginia. the ingenuity of local government.

We had 13.000 criminal cases a year. Fighting crime is serious business. It requires a two pronged approach: One is priority prosecution to remove those individuals. the worst offenders. from society and put them away for as long as you can get them away. The challenge we face in law enforcement is what are we going to do with the majority of the people who remain? There are countless examples from all over the country of priority prosecution programs. When they mix prevention programs and get police officers involved with the school and open up schools for kids to provide prevention programs. it works. It is working in the city of Lowell. where crime prevention programs have resulted in dramatically lowering gang violence in that city. Crime prevention programs have worked in Summerville. MA. dramatically decreasing the rates of crime. Fighting crime is not a political issue. it should not be partisan. It should not be Republican versus Democrat.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation to permanently suspend the duty on the chemical tetra amino biphenyl [TAB]. This chemical is imported to the United States from Germany. TAB is an essential raw material used in the production of a high performance fiber called \"PBI.\" PBI is a unique heat and chemical resistant fiber that. in some uses. can be a suitable replacement for asbestos. PBI has a wide range of thermal protective applications including flight suits and garments for firefighters. boiler tenders. and refinery workers. Mr. President. In previous Congresses. I introduced similar legislation to apply dutyfree treatment to TAB. These bills were ultimately incorporated into the Omnibus Tariff and Trade Act of 1984. the Omnibus Trade Act of 1988. and the Customs and Trade Act of 1990. The current duty suspension for this chemical expired December 31. 1992. During the Uruguay Round negotiations. the Administration made a commitment to negotiate the elimination of duties on products covered by duty suspension legislation. However. TAB was inadvertently deleted from Tariff Schedule XX during talks on the GATT Agreement. This chemical has been on the duty suspension list for several years. It is a noncontroversial item and should have been included in the final Tariff Schedule XX approved at Marrakesh. Mr. President. it is my understanding that TAB was on the original Department of Commerce \"Consolidated Duty Suspension List\" of products to be incorporated into the U.S. offer and on subsequent offers until the final document was prepared in March. The February 25th offer. which was the last list made available to the public. included TAB as \"free\" under the proposed HTS 2921.59.14. When the importing company asked why it was deleted. they were told that it was incorporated into either the pharmaceutical or intermediate chemicals for dyes lists. Recently. importers were surprised to discover that TAB was not covered under any duty suspension and would be assessed a 12.8 percent duty. According to the company. it is not covered under any tariff heading. no industry opposition has been found. and no instructions were issued which would have deleted TAB from the list. I hope the Senate will consider this measure expeditiously. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am introducing a bill today. which this body previously approved as an amendment to the first bill amending the Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] that the Senate passed in 1989. This bill would solve a problem with the interpretation of a provision of the FLSA. clarifying that the maximum hour exemption for agricultural employees applies to water delivery organizations that supply 75 percent or more of their water for agricultural purposes. Representative MIKE CRAPO. of the Second District of Idaho. is today introducing an identical bill in the other body. Our bill would restore an exemption that was always intended by Congress. Companies that deliver water for agricultural purposes are exempt from the maximumhour requirements of the FLSA. The Department of Labor has interpreted this to mean that no amount of this water. however minimal. can be used for other purposes. Therefore. if even a small portion of the water delivered winds up being used for road watering. lawn and garden irrigation. livestock consumption. or construction. for example. delivery organizations are assessed severe penalties. The exemption for overtime pay requirements was placed in the FLSA to protect the economies of rural areas. Irrigation has never been. and can not be. a 40hourperweek undertaking. During the summer. water must be managed and delivered continually. Later in the year. following the harvest. the work load is light. consisting mainly of maintenance duties. Our bill is better for employers. workers. and farmers. Winter compensation and time off traditionally have been the method of compensating for longer summer hours. Without this exemption. irrigators are forced to lay off their employees in the winter. Therefore. our bill would benefit employees. who would continue to earn a yearround income. It also would keep costs level. which would benefit suppliers and consumers. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

The aid package consisted of a mere $1 million to fulfill the International Committee for the Red Cross request. an additional $25.000 from USAID through the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. and 50.000 pounds of U.S. military medical supplies and equipment. Due to the most recent violence in Lebanon. some 400.000 refugees have been displaced. There is an extreme amount of pressure upon the countrys infrastructure. particularly in Beirut where there is very little electricity. In southern Lebanon it has been reported that the water supply has been cut off to dozens of villages. The Lebanese people have suffered greatly over the last two decades. but they are particularly in need of urgent assistance. The United States has always viewed Lebanon as a good friend and ally. and thus the United States should make a greater commitment of resources. Considering the Presidents past emergency aid packages of $59 million for Rwandan and Burundi refugees and $11 million for Cuban and Haitian refugees. the Clinton administration efforts with respect to Lebanon is clearly and grossly insufficient. For approximately the same amount of refugees in Russia. this administration donated 1.2 million pounds of medical supplies and equipment. This inequity with respect to Lebanon is clearly unfair. Mr. President. I urge the Clinton administration to immediately redouble its aid efforts to Lebanon. In addition. as I have done for the past week. I urge the administration to utilize all of its diplomatic resources to negotiate a cease fire in this region and to bring and end to the hostility immediately.e",

These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning first place at the statewide competition in Connecticut. The distinguished members of the team representing Connecticut are: David Abbate. Stephen Britton. Meredith Bucci. William Dunn. Brian Emery. Michael Felberbaum. Kristina Gosplc. Pamela Harinstein. Bruce Malloy. Philip Moore. Jessica Paris. Michael Ragozzino. Douglas Rowe. Matthew Rowland. Jason Saunders. John Urbanati. Richard Van Haste and Alison Veno. I would also like to recognize their teacher. Rita Altieri. who deserves a share of the credit for the success of the team. The district coordinator Jane Hammer and the State coordinator Joani Byer also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the team to the national finals. The We the PeopleThe Citizen and the Constitution Program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The 3day national competition simulates a congressional hearing in which students oral presentations are judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues. Administered by the Center for Civic Education. the We the PeopleProgram. now in its ninth academic year. has reached more than 70.400 teachers and 22.600.000 students nationwide at the upper elementary. middle. and high school levels. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers. The We the PeopleProgram provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history and our lives. I wish these students the best of luck in the national finals and look forward to their continued success in the years ahead.*",

At that time the American public said \"no\" to severe cuts In Medicare and Medicaid. in education. in the environment. Although we fought that battle and staved off those cuts. the congressional majority is back here again to cut Medicare. We are looking at a $168 billion cut in Medicare. Cuts of this magnitude force rural hospitals to close and will limit the ability of senior citizens to choose their own doctor. What are our priorities? What are our values in this Nation? We now have 99 percent of our seniors covered for health care through the Medicare system. Why would we want to dismantle Medicare? It was the gentleman from Georgia who said not too long ago that what he wanted to see with Medicare was to have it wither on the vine. The money they cut from Medicare does not go into the Medicare trust fund. Do not let them kid you with that argument. What they will do is one more time pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. The tax break package is $180 billion. and the cut in Medicare is $168 billion. Understand the debate.",

Last June. after the publication of the final regulations for the Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act. I was contacted by school food service providers from my congressional district. One particular individual. Richard Deburgh. director of food services for the Glendale Unified School District. expressed his concern about the regulations in a letter urging that we \"support the dietary guidelines but oppose dietary commandments.\" This sentiment was echoed by others who contacted me to express their concern that the regulations would affect their ability to prepare meals which were not only healthy and met the dietary guidelines. but which children would eat. As we all know. the same foods do not appeal to all children in all areas of the country. It Is important to allow local school food service providers the freedom to provide students with meals they will eat. Mr. Speaker. those individuals who work with children each day in local schools know best what they will eat. They live in the local community. talk to the children each day as they pass through the cafeteria line. and have a vested interest in the health of these children. We need to provide them with the flexibility to design and serve healthy meals which children will eat. H.R. 2066 provides schools with this flexibility and at the same time. maintains the requirement that such meals meet the dietary guidelines for Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

Schools need to provide nutritious and wholesome food to nourish growing children at the same time that schools work to nourish the students minds and spirits with education. I believe that our local schools should be given the flexibility to offer food that the students will actually like to eat. I support this Healthy Meals for Children Act because it will give schools the discretion to meet the goal of offering nutritious and wholesome food to our children. Furthermore. I am concerned about the cost of wasting food in our schools. Food is essential nourishment for everyone. and I support policies that would allow the Houston Independent School District [HISD] to design a nutritional program. In the HISD school system. schools can provide students with nutritious meals while giving students food that they like to eat. and then designing a program to allow the Houston schools to donate the extra food to feed the homeless. I encourage the formation of such a program by HISD and I encourage other districts to adopt this innovative and beneficial program. Hunger in America warrants continued efforts to stomp out hunger.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 2066. the Healthy Meals for Children Act of 1996. I know the Chairman of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee. Mr. GOODLING. has sought a remedy for the problems caused by the implementation of the Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act of 1994 and this bill represents that corrective action. When Congress passed and the President signed the 1994 amendments. we all believed that schools would be allowed to use a foodbased system to meet the dietary guidelines for the school meals programs. Unfortunately. the regulations Implementing the 1994 amendments did not provide this flexibility to schools. Local school employees involved in the planning and preparation of school meals work very hard to make sure that the meals are nutritious and good tasting. A meal not eaten provides no benefit to anyone. Their challenge is to balance good nutrition with what children will eat. The bill under consideration today provides for the flexibility and I am pleased to support it. When these regulations were proposed in 1994. a hearing was held in the Committee on Agriculture. Members of the committee made it clear that the proposed rules would tie the hands of local schools and impose financial hardships on these schools. especially those in rural areas. Despite the concerns expressed. the Department of Agriculture went ahead and finalized the rules. Since that time local schools have continued to express their concerns. Therefore it was necessary to bring a second bill to the House to ensure that local schools are provided with the flexibility that will allow them to prepare nutritious meals that meet the dietary guidelines. There is a practical case to be made that local schools administrators should be able to decide how best to meet the needs of children participating In the School Lunch Program. No Federal regulation can guarantee that a nutritious school lunch will be consumed by children In school. No school lunch. no matter how nutritious. improves the diets of children if that lunch is not eaten. This bill represents a commonsense approach to health and nutritious meals in our schools. Mr. Speaker. I am informed that the administration fully supports this bill and I urge all Members to support H.R. 2066.",

The National Park Service. pursuant to a previous act of Congress. has studied the trail and found that it merits designation as a national historic trail. It is important to note that the National Park Service felt the events which took place at this site were so significant that it warranted waiving the customary 50year waiting period for designation of historic sites. The language including in the bill by the subcommittee makes it clear that by enactment of this legislation. Congress will not be establishing the Selma to Montgomery Trail as a new unit of the National Park System. Only 2 of the approximately 15 congressionally designated trails are currently units of the park system. However. the definition of what constitutes a unit of the park system is so unclear. that the other trails could be easily added at a later date by administrative action.

All I am saying is the Secretary of Agriculturethis is what the amendment saysthe Secretary of Agriculture shall determine whether these coops who oversee the program. who also are the beneficiaries of the program. violate the Federal ethics law. That is all this amendment says. That is not a change in the peanut program. That is just saying we should have some ethics in dealing with this issue. There have already been letters filed. to the Secretary of Agriculture. back on June 5 requesting the Secretary to take action. The Secretary has not responded.

    "speech": "Mr. President. needless to say. I oppose both Senator SANrORuMs amendments. which are renewed assaults on the livelihoods of Americas family farmers who produce peanuts. I should reiterate that there are more than 20.000 North Carolinians involved in various aspects of the peanut industry. Weve been down this road time and time again. Mr. President. However. this time. even the fiercest critics of the peanut program should acknowledge the extensive changes made by Congress in the 1996 farm bill. The most important change was the conversion of the peanut program into a nonet cost commodity program. Mr. President. the burden of these changes is being borne by Americas peanut farmers who understood the necessity of revamping the program in order for it to survive. The support price was cut by 10 percent. from $678 per ton to S610 and because of many other changes. peanut farmers anticipate that their incomes will decline by more than 20 percent. So clearly. Mr. President. Americas peanut farmers have agreed to--indeed. participated in reforming the program that has served the consumers of America so well. And. by the way. in North Carolina alone. the peanut industry generates more than $100 million in revenue. Moreover. Mr. President. the American taxpayers will save more than $434 million as a result of the reforms in the program. It is discouraging that opponents of the program. not satisfied with the farm bills reforms. now seek to go further in hindering peanut farmers in making their livings. As for the Santorum amendments. they will notand cannot -guarantee lower prices to consumers. Instead. they will disrupt the work of Congress which constructed a farm program to produce a reasonable price. an abundant supply. and the highest quality of peanuts in the world. Mr. President. it was clearly established during the Agriculture Committees debates on the 1996 farm bill that even if the peanut program were to be abolished. candymakers would not reduce the price of a candy bar. nor would the price of peanut butter be reduced by one red cent. The pending afterthefact amendments do not deserve serious consideration. The Senate should reject them unhesitatingly.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this is a very simple amendment that has nothing to do with the peanut program. This does not change the peanut program at all. This actually does not change anything In law. All this amendment does is ask the Secretary of Agriculture to determine whether the regulatory body that oversees the peanut program is in violation of the Government ethics statute. That is all this amendment does. Why do I ask the Secretary to do that? The reason I ask the Secretary to do that is. unlike virtually any other agriculture commodity program. the folks who oversee the program. who manage the loan policies. who help promulgate the regulations. the very same people who regulate this program. who enforce the program. who actually impose penalties on the quota hold-.rs are. themselves. the quota holders. The people who benefit from the program run the program. That is unlike any other program. with the exception of one. in this country. What we want to do is simply ask the Secretary of Agriculture to examine m the applicable Federal statutes to determine whether there is a conflict of interest here. and then take action. Frankly. the reason I am here on the floor with this amendment. some additional growers out West in Texas. New Mexico. Oklahoma. and a lot of other places. had asked the Secretary to make this determination 2 months ago. They asked him in a letter. He has not responded to that letter. So what we are trying to do is say. Mr. Secretary. let us look and see if there is a conflict of interest. We do not prejudge it. We ask them to examine to see whether this is a proper setup for the regulation of this program. It does not change the program. It does not alter it in midstream. It simply asks the Secretary to take a look at a potential conflict of interest. I hope we can get very strong support for this.",

This is just another attack on the peanut program with an effort to try to have a lawsuit. and these people have hired the biggest law firm in Washington to bring the lawsuit.

Catholic schools on Guam are not just on the forefront of elementary and secondary education. they are on the cutting edge. Our Catholic schools. in addition to traditional quality teaching. are leaders in innovation. Last year three elementary schools started yearround education. This new strategy is sure to benefit our students and our island. The Catholic school system rose to prominence after World War I1. Many fine educators and religious leaders built the foundation of our present Catholic school system. On a personal note. I would also like to mention the contributions of my aunt.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to commend the fine efforts of the North Carolina Electronics and Information Technologies [NCEITA] to play a constructive role in the debate over telecommunications reform this year. NCEITA was formed in 1993 as the primary association representing North Carolinas hightechnology companies. Rapid growth in our States electronics and information industries has made it the second largest employer in North Carolina. accounting for more than 145.000 jobs. North Carolina. with its Research Triangle Park. the Nations oldest and largest research park. has become one of the Nations premier locations for firms in electronics. telecommunications. computer systems. and other hightechnology fields. As Congress considered the sweeping rewrite of our communications laws this year. NCEITA encouraged policymakers to take a close look at North Carolinas commitment to build a fully interactive fiberoptic network throughout the State and the advanced telecommunications capabilities available to its citizens. At the end of 1994. over 40.000 sheath miles of fiberoptic cable had been deployed throughout our State. providing the backbone for date transmission. Currently. over 97 percent of North Carolina businesses have access to digital switching. This interactive broadband network allows students to participate in classroom debates taking place on the other side of the State or browse through the library collections at distant universities. Cardiac specialists in Chapel Hill can now examine video images of the beating heart of an elderly woman in her doctors office in the mountains of Hendersonville. NC. Using North Carolina as a model of the benefits of advanced telecommunications capabilities. NCEITA urged legislators to promote the deployment of advanced telecommunications networks nationwide to enable all Americans to originate and receive affordable. highquality voice. data. image. graphic. and video telecommunications services. NCEITA emphasized deregulation and competition in the local telephone exchange as the means toward spurring investment in these advanced broadband networks. As a result of their efforts on the legislative front. Congress chose to include a provision authorizing the Federal Communications Commission to encourage the timely deployment of advanced telecommunications capabilities. if necessary. through policies of pricing regulation. regulatory forbearance and promoting competition in the local telephone exchange. Quite simply. this will enable Americans to communicate better tomorrow than they can today. For that. NCEITA member companiesparticularly Broad Band Technologies. Siecor. Nortel. and General Instrumentsdeserve special recognition.",

Representatives MORELLA. DAVIS. and LUTHER. I am introducing a resolution to postpone final action on Legislative Branch appropriations for any fiscal year until all other regular appropriations for that fiscal year have been enacted into law. The resolution adds new points of order under three House Rules. These would preclude final action on the regular Legislative Branch appropriations bill. if all other regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year have not been enacted into law. Similarly. a continuing resolution could not contain Legislative Branch appropriations unless it also included continuing appropriations for the same period for all other regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that have not yet been enacted into law. Basically. this means. for Legislative Branch appropriations. there could be no final action on conference reports. no motions on Senate amendments. and no action on continuing resolutions if we have not first. or concurrently. provided appropriations for the other twelve regular appropriations. This resolution would ensure that the Legislative Branch is last in line for appropriations in the future. The concept is elementaryno dessert until we clean our plates. Last September. Congress made the mistake of trying to fully fund the Legislative Branch bill for fiscal year 1996 before taking care of nearly every other appropriations bill. And it backfired.

This week we are going to be debating a number of important legal and economic issues. and one of the most critical will be finally addressing the explosion of abusive and speculative litigation known as \"strike suits.\" For too many years American high technology and manufacturing companies have faced the unreasonable risk and threat of litigation at the cost of higher product prices. diminished earnings shareholder returns. reduced capital investment. and a less vibrant American economy. As a result many people are not willing to serve on the boards of directors of these companies. Many companies. even where there is no fraud and no negligence committed. are faced with the tremendous cost of litigations. It also makes companies far less willing to disclose useful and valuable information to the public. Such abuses simply cannot be allowed to continue unchecked. Robert Samuelson. a noted economist. pointed out the huge increase in legal costs in our society. Over a 22year period legal fees as a percent of the gross national product increased ninetenths of 1 percent to 1.7 percent. nearly double. When you consider that 3 or 4 percent is considered good growth in the economy. and you drain off 1.7 percent in nonproductive fees of this sort. it is clear the tremendous harm that it does to our economy. the harm it does to jobs and to the standard of living of the average working American. Let me close by quoting from Jim Kimsey. who represents the American Electronic Association. before the Telecommunications Committee. Of the explosion In securities litigation he said: \"We believe the current securities litigation system promotes meritless litigation. shortchanges Investors. and costs jobs. It Is a showcase example of the legal system run awry. It Is bad law. bad policy. and bad economics.\" Mr. Chairman. the time has come to act and pass securities reform litigation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of H.R. 1058. the Securities Litigation Reform Act. As a member of the Telecom and Finance Subcommittee. I have long supported similar legislation to fix our broken securities litigation system. The system is broken for defrauded investors who recall and recover only a small amount of their losses when part of valid cases. The system is broken for businesses. especially the startup highteoh firms who rely on capital markets for financting. And it is broken for the general public who ultimately must pay the price of frivolous litigation in the form of slower economic growth. fewer jobs. and higher prices. It is very clear we have a serious problem. I say to my colleagues. strike a blow for our small businesses and startup enterprises. Support H.R. 1058.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in strong support of HR. 1058. We must end abuse that is eroding our legal system. As stated by SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt. private actions are intended to compensate defrauded investors and deter securities violations. If the current system fails to distinguish between strong and weak cases. it serves neither purpose effectively. I could not agree more. Unfortunately. this is precisely with what we are left today. an ineffective system. The changes mandated by this legislation would help restore responsibility and respectability to our corporate system. First. the provision that imposes loserpays rules when the court determines the position of the losing party was not substantially justified are warranted. This would prevent the consummate race to the courthouse. Plaintiffs will have to weigh the merits of the case before filing suit. Opponents claim this will have a chilling effect on plaintiffs right to sue. This is simply not the case. The modified loserpays provision will only result in fee shifting in cases that should not have been brought in the first place. The only thing chilled by this provision would be meritless suits which I believe deserve to be put in the deep freeze. Second. as for the definition of recklessness. the current law is vague and uncertain. Parties may engage in nearly identical conduct. yet courts reach completely different results. The vagueness and uncertainty of the current standard has led to a great deal of inconsistency. confusion. and unfairness in our judicial system. I think all of us would agree that by creating consistency we can increase fairness and decrease the probability of injustice in our legal system. In general. most strike suits under current law do more harm than good. Reform is needed for two main reasons. No. 1. proper plaintiffs must have a place to redress valid grievances.",

I would just like to point out to my colleagues that there are 435 votes in this House to improve class action security fraud lawsuits. We want to stop the race to the courthouse. We want to sanction lawyers who bring frivolous cases or bring them in bad faith. But what we really hear from the other side about the virtues that our antifraud laws bring to our investors and to our market. we rarely hear about the need for a balanced approach to reform. We rarely hear the mention of the terrible frauds that have occurred over the last 10 years. and we never hear assurances from the other side that their legislation will not adversely impact these disastrous situations like Drexel and Milken and Boesky and Lincoln Savings and Keating and Miniscribe and many others. If the legislation brought here today was meant to shut down these legal firms that take professional plaintiffs and terrorize private corporations across this country. I think we can find a consensus. The truth of the matter is though the legislation we are considering here today shuts down the good suits. the legitimate suits. the suits that have to be brought by individuals in this country against Boesky and against Milken and against Keating and against all of those S&L scam artists that were out there in the 1980s. the scam artists that resulted in the U.S. Congress being forced to vote for 100 to 150 billion dollars worth of taxpayer dollars in order to insure that those who had put their life savings in the S&Ls and banks across this country did not in fact face bankruptcy.

Mr. Chairman. the engine of economic growth in this country is under assault from some lawyers who give the term \"gone fishing\" an entirely new meaning. These strikesuit lawyers are trolling for easy money won from vulnerable companies whose only crime is being subject to a volatile market. Entrepreneurial hightech companies in my State such as EMC Corp. based in my district are being hit with strike suits which seek damages for loss in stock value. This is a company that has created thousands of jobs in the State of Massachusetts. Since going public in 1986. it has been the subject of two such suits. One was filed less than 24 hours after the company disclosed quarterly earnings lower than the previous quarter. This kind of situation is not unusual. Hundreds of suits are filed by lawyers and professional plaintiffs who prey on small hightech firms because their stocks tend to be more volatile and they are more inclined to settle. In fact. between 1989 and 1993. 61 percent of all strike suits were brought against companies with less than $500 million in annual sales. and 33 percent against companies with less than $100 million in sales. Mr. Speaker. the problem is critical. because these hightech companies are the jobcreating innovators. where many of our cuttingedge products originate. These are companies that are leading our export efforts in our economy. Biotechnology companies in my district are developing treatments for cancer and AIDS. These kinds of strike suits are jeopardizing the development of those lifesaving products by holding these companies hostage. These companies are forced to divert resources. energy. talent. and money to fighting these unwarranted strike suits. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. and let us have a strong growth export economy.",

But that is not the type of lawsuit that would be affected by the one killer amendment by the gentleman from California who will offer it very soon in this debate. By blocking all possibility of civil RICO lawsuits for securities fraud. the Cox amendment would incredibly harm plantiffs such as the elderly bondholders who were cheated out of their lifes savings by Charles Keating in the Lincoln Savings and Loan debacle. It would deny any effective remedy for the thousands of depositors of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. the notorious BCCI. which regulators from 62 countries united to shut down because of the banks fraudulent practices. Why an amendment of such a broad sweep that it would prevent lawsuits against some of the biggest whitecollar criminals in the Nations history. even though the sponsors of the amendment may not have intended such a result? The answer is this amendment was hastily put together without the benefit of any hearings or debate in any committee or the possibility of a markup where there could have been important improvements. and now within an 8hour ambit. we are asked to consider the revocation of the greatest single crimefighting bill provision.

I guess we accidentally did not have any hearings. I guess there accidentally were not any witnesses. I guess this was all an accident that needs to be corrected right now.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. You know. proponents of this socalled securities litigation reform are arguing that private securities and class action suits are making it virtually impossible for public companies to raise capital and are preventing these companies from going public. But they will tell you only anecdotes about their friends in big business who would prefer not to be sued because they really cannot rely on the facts. The facts will show that our markets have been tremendously successful in raising capital for public companies. Every important statistical measure of the success of our securities markets. the number and proceeds of initial public offerings. the volume and value of common stock offerings. the volume of trading. have been at alltime highs. The number of initial public security offerings has risen 9.000 percent in the last 20 years while the proceeds raised have skyrocketed 38.000 percent. The staff report of the Senate Subcommittee on Securities has found that. \"Despite the claims by critics that securities litigation is hampering capital formation. initial public offerings have proceeded at a record pace in recent years.\" We all know that recently the DowJones Industrial Averages surpassed the 4.000 mark. which is an alltime high. That has to make us all wonder how can it be that there is such a serious problem from the roughly 300 fraud class action cases filed each year. In light of the facts. claims by companies that they are afraid to go public to raise capital because of fear of litigation are nothing but really selfserving nonsense. If they are really are so concerned about litigation. they would not be restricting the minuscule number of private securities fraud class actions. they would be restricting the huge and increasing numbers of businessversusbusiness suits. As the Rand Corp.s recent study of the litigation patterns of Fortune 1.000 companies demonstrates. by far. is that you are seeing many more firms that are suing other firms. As the Wall Street Journal. in an article of December 3. 1993. entitled \"Suits by Firms Exceed Those by Individuals.\" noted. \"Businesses may be their own worst enemies when it comes to the socalled litigation explosion.\" 9909 O97 Vol. 141 (Pt 5) 37 So why is it that proponents are seeking to limit only private actions and not business suits?",

I am advised that officials of the Jefferson County Development Authority have been working with the staff of the General Services Administration to develop a telecommuting center in the Charles Town area.

The purpose of this amendment is to make an amount of 3250.000 available for the establishment of a telecommuting center in the Charles Town area. The amendment would not diminish the funds already available for centers in Maryland and Virginia. Rather. the funds would be derived from monies set aside in the bill for nonprospectus construction projects. that is. projects costing less than S1.5 million. including such minor projects as periodic painting and repair of mechanical. electrical. and other building components.

I respect very much his distinguished tenure as Governor of Nebraska and his knowledge of the importance of having a political presence within any kind of executive administration. if you want to implement the policies you run on. I indicated that. and it was also indicated from the Volcker Commission. and others comments to that effect. The question is what level? What I have indicated here and want to repeat is that that clearly has been a greater theme of government with respect to political appointees than other people in executive positions. It has grown 17 percent. while in the nonpolitical area it has only grown approximately 5 percent. That is the question. Clearly. I say to the Senator from Nebraska. Mr. President. there must be some point at which there are too many political appointeesperhaps 10.000. or 8.000. At some point there are too many people. What these reports have suggested. almost ironically. is that. if you get too many political appointees. the chief executive of a State or the Federal Government cannot even keep track of them so that it actually can backfire on them. It could actually end up being worse than having the right mix between civil service career people and political appointees. In response to the earlier question. as I understand it. there were six members of the task force within the Volcker Commission that examined the specific issue of political appointees. The chairman of that task force was Elliot Richardson. Among the members were Robert McFarlane. Walter Mondale. Benjamin Read. Anne Wexler. and Alan Wolff. and they came up with this conclusion that we ought to go to 2.000 again. To reiterate. my amendmentactually the House amendment that I simply want to restorewould not take this to 2.000 as I originally hoped. It would simply take us to the 2.300 figure.",

Middleincome taxpayers will overwhelmingly benefit directly from the capital gains tax cut. as the vast majority of taxpayers claiming capital gains are middle income In fact. 70 percent of all taxpayers reporting capital gains. in a recent tax year. had incomes of less than $50.000. By comparison. 5 percent of tax returns with capital gains were from taxpayers with annual incomes between $100.000 and $200.000. And. fully threequarters of the value of all capital gains went to taxpayers earning less than $100.000. Most importantly. capital gains tax cuts means more jobs for the American people. One leading economist testified in the Ways and Means Committee that 285.000 Jobs a yearor about 1.4 million over the 5 year periodwill be gained. The same economist showed that every $1 billion reduction in annual taxes on capital income will lead to a $25 billion increase in the Nations output of goods and services. Capital gains relief will facilitate the growth of new business and job formation. improve longterm productivity and make the United States more competitive.

To finance their tax bill they have to raise $12 billion. So what do they do? They ask Federal employees to increase their contribution for their retirement program by 2.5 percent. What does that mean? It means that for the average Federal employee making about $30.000. it is a tax of $750 a yea.r. Why? The program is not insolvent. The program is not overly generous. People in the private sector do not pay anything toward their retirement programs. So it works out like this: In order to get a $500perchild tax credit. Federal employees. whether they have a child. or not. have to pay a tax of $750. It does not make sense. Moreover. todays Washington Post points out that fully 50 percent of the tax benefits to go to the top 10 percent of Americans. not the Ma and Pa stores and not your average American citizen. and fully 10 percent of these socalled tax benefits for the middle class go to the top 1 percent of wage earners in this country.

They also plan $10 billion in tax cuts. the bulk of which will go to the richest citizens in America. In other words.

One of the main reasons for my opposition is the severe cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. For a modest investment of $162 million. the preservation of our cultural resources outweigh the small cost to the government each year. Recently. this Republican Congress proposed the elimination of Federal funding for these institutions. The purpose of these agencies is to provide support for arts organizations. In turn. these groups offer the community many activities such as plays. festivals. and seminars that cannot occur without Federal assistance. Furthermore. no arts organizations receive grants from the NEA or the NEH without providing matching funds. On July 17. the House voted to approve the fiscal year 1996 Interior appropriations bill which cut Federal funding to the National Endowment for the Arts by 40 percent. leaving only $99 million. There were three amendments to the bill which would have cut all funding to the endowment and thus. completely phase out the agency at the end of this year. Fortunately. bipartisan efforts defeated the amendments. However. in this era of Federal budget constraints. every Federal program. whether it is worthy or not. is subject to cuts. While we must work toward a balanced budget. we must not make indiscriminate and arbitrary cuts in the NEA budget. Recently. Chairman Jane Alexander has had to implement a 47 percent reduction of staff. Because of these reductions. the number of applications will have to be significantly cut and viable arts organizations will be hurt. During my tenure in the California legislature. I continually met with business leaders who supported the arts. I believe that support for the arts is essential and contributes to our economic edge. The same hands that mold clay or play the piano can also program computers and start new businesses. It is our creativity which must be nurtured from an early age. We cannot afford to abolish the NEA and the NEH. It is an investment in our future.",

You have heard the gentleman from New York speak and the gentleman from Alaska who had some differences on the Tongass and on mining. and they both agreed that this represents a reasonable compromise. as was clearly pointed out by the chairman. I would just point out. also. that in terms of the Tongass. we have reduced the cut from 450 million board feet to 418 and as a practical matter. it will be about 310. Likewise. we have addressed the mining concerns. The issues that were in the recommittals. I think. have been very thoroughly addressed. and this is quite evident by the fact that the people who have an interest on both sides have spoken in favor of this bill. Also. I would address the question the President raises in his message about not enough money is being spent. Well. obviously earlier we heard that It was a budget buster. Now. I think that message is a bit in conflict. The truth of the matter is it Is a responsible bill. and it does reduce spending. but it uses the funds available in a very prudent way. As far as the Bureau of Indian Affairs. we have addressed the needs of education. of health. We are actually above the Presidents request in one of his last statements. Overall I think that we have a very good bill. I think it is important we get this down to the White House. and I hope that they would sign this so that the 130.000 people that serve all of us In the parks and forests can get on with the job and serve the American people in the way that they would like. Let me strongly urge the members on both sides to reject the recommittal motion which will be again on the Tongass. We have already. as you have heard from other speakers. we have addressed the problems in the Tongass. Let us reject the recommittal motion and pass the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this conference report. While this bill contains many important elements for natural resource dependent communities. I want to highlight one very important provision that was included in the conference committee yesterday by Senator GORTON. This provision calls for the National Park Service to extend the lease at Pearson Airpark in the city of Vancouver past the year 2002. This is a key element in my legislation to create the Fort Vancouver National Historic Reserve. While I anticipate that my legislation will pass the House next year. I am supportive of efforts to expedite the process with respect to Pearson Airpark. The designation of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Reserve will. of course. go through the normal authorizing process. It was important to expedite the extension of the lease to give the city of Vancouver and the M.J. Murdock trust the certainty they need to forge ahead with the construction of the Murdock Aviation Museum. This will be a Smithsonian quality museum that will highlight the rich aviation history in the city of Vancouver. This legislation will go a long way to making this museum a reality.

The Endangered Species Act has destroyed the rights of hardworking. taxpaying American families for the sake of blind cave spiders. fairy shrimp. and goldencheeked warblers. Until Congress reauthorizes the Endangered Species Act to balance the rights of landowners and common sense with environmental concerns. we must protect American landowners by putting regulators on a leash.

How can we claim not to find the funds to protect elderly citizens from going into complete poverty because of out of pocket medical expenses. yet we can give away precious minerals at bargain basement prices? To eliminate programs that meet human needs and that provide tangible results. under the guise of conserving Government funds. without terminating wasteful programs such as mining subsidies. is hypocritical.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. one of the goals of the Contract With America is to generate economic growth and encourage job creation. Relieving the regulatory burden on Individuals and businesses is essential to achievIng this objective. Today. the House of Representatives took a step in this direction by requiring Federal bureaucrats to assess the cost of their actions. Washington bureaucrats are costing us $430 billion a year with regulations that often do more harm than good. They are coming up with $50 solutions for $5 problems. Its time for common sense in Washington. Last year 69.000 pages of Federal rules and regulations were published. The process of regulating has become an Industry in lawyers. lobbyists. and special Interests. These rules and regulations9 feet of regulations. if laid endtoend--mpact every aspect of Americans lives. The rules are often contradictory. and frequently conflict with State. county and local rules. Specifically. H.R. 1022 would ensure that risk assessments are objective. unbiased. and subject to peer review. The cost these rules will eventually have on Americans must be taken Into account. alternatives to complicated rules that might be more costeffective must be considered. and a sound reason for the regulation in the first place must be demonstrated. This legislation would simply require that the Federal bureaucracy assess the costs of their actions on the rest of us. We are living in an era of declining revenues. and we must make choices and set priorities. And our Governmentbureaucrats as well as elected officialsmust be accountable. The problem is that we now tend to direct our resources to relatively lowrisk concerns while other. more serious concerns receive little attention. Since theres no standarized method of riskassessment to be used throughout the Government. policymakers are unable to prioritize regulatory strategies in a commonsense manner. This bill allows us to concentrate scarce dollars where they will do the most good. and analyze alternatives to achieve the goal of public safety at the lowest possible cost.",

I am extremely disappointed with the lack of full consideration of this important piece of legislation. I support regulatory reform. In particular. I support costbenefit analysis and risk assessment as tools to develop rational regulations. I have spoken with small business owners. oil and chemical companies. and other constituents who have relayed to me their stories of frustration over the regulatory process. Ive also talked to constituents who are concerned about health. safety. and the environment their kids will grow up in. Our job Is to find the appropriate. delicate balance between the interests of commerce. industry. and the environment. This legislation Is too quick of a fix to solve such a complex problem. Reforming Federal regulations will help our economy to grow. The timeconsuming process of filling out environmental Impact statements or hundreds of pages of small business loan forms are good examples of why reform Is necessary. But this bill doesnt guarantee regulations that are sensible. On the contrary. conducting acrosstheboard riskassessments will lengthen the review process. transform simple rules Into complex monstrosities. and cost taxpayers millions. Given time for thorough consideration. I believe that this body might have crafted a sensible compromise. Unfortunately. this Is not that bill. Mr. Chairman. I must add that I cannot support a process which limits debate to only 10 hours and restricts the number of amendments allowed for consideration. This Is not full and fair disclosure. The American people expect and deserve a full airing of these important Issues in the Congress. and not this reckless. hasty display. Once again. the job of fair and bipartisan legislating is left to the other body. That Is a terrible shame. because regulatory reform is deserving of much more thorough consideration.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. H.R. 1022 is regulation by strangulation. If you think government red tape has been tied in knots. just wait until you experience the results of this Republican red flag against public health and safety and the environment. The cumbersome imposition of regulations on top of regulations will only serve to delay approval of anything to protect public health and 3afety and the environment. The resulting delay will threaten the lives of many and the future of all Americans. In our daily lives. the delay will translate into unregulated food and chemical products and In the longer term. the risk will be the loss of our national patrimony. Once again. the contract Is placing financial interests over the interests of American public. A CNN/Time poll taken at the end of January determined that Americans consider environmental protection one of the most important problems23 percent--or very Important65 percent. Only 23 percent of the people surveyed believed that protection from pollution had gone too far. The risk in risk assessment Is great. You cannot put a price on preventing illness. saving lives or preserving natural lands. Common sense should be brought to this debate on dollars and cents. A petroleum industry official had this comment about H.R. 1022: This reminds of 1981. when the industry shot itself in the foot * * * Business not only lost but managed to engender much of the strident public environmental sentiment that later resulted in far stricter laws. H.R. 1022 does not discriminate between regulations--ones where the process should be reexamined or streamlined and ones that should be eliminated. The indiscriminate overriding of existing protections throws out the good with the bad. Like other components of the Republican regulatory reform package. H.R. 1022 represents another opportunity for special interests to paralyze the Federal regulatory process at the expense of average. taxpaying Americans. In this case. Mr. Chairman. less government means more government. The layers of bureaucracy that will be added to the regulatory process by H.R. 1022 will put more lives in harms way. If you want to vote for more goveminent and less public health and environmental protection. then you have the right bill in front of you. If you want to vote for government reform. you will need to look elsewhere. I urge my colleagues to vote for less governmentvote \"no\" on H.R. 1022.+",

The problem that I have with that being sufficient is that it does not go as far as 1822 did last year. in that it is after the fact. In other words. let us pick the regional Bell operating company in our area. U.S. West. Let us say U.S. West now does all 14 of the things that are required in order to get into the interLATA. in order to do the long distance. and they come to the FCC and get permission to do long distance service. Well. the problem is. if the Department of Justice wants to take action. they have to take action after the fact. after permission is granted. after they are in long distance. then they have to come and take action. What I would feel more comfortable with is if we had DOJ involved. as 1822 did. in a parallel fashion. not in addition to. What I was most interested in was making sure that there was a parallel process with a time certain. And in the language of the Dorgan amendment. as amended. as well by the Senator from South Carolina. there is a 90day time certain. and a parallel process occurs. You do not file to one and then go to the other. The precedent that I am trying to use repeatedlyand I think it is a good oneis that in 1984 the Department of Justice was the one that managed the transition from a monopoly to a competitive environment in long distance.",

I am today introducing legislation to resolve a longstanding problem ski areas permittees on Forest Service land have encountered with the fee system the Forest Service developed to calculate their rental fees. This legislation creates a new and simplified ski area fee system to calculate rental fees for these ski areas for use of the national forest lands. This same fee system legislation passed the Senate during the 102d Congress but time ran out before the legislation was considered in the House. This proposal was determined to be revenue neutral to the United States by the Congressional Budget Office. The ski area permittees support this proposal because it is revenue neutral and at the same time collects their fees utilizing a simplified formula that everyone can understand. The Forest Service manual and handbook currently contain over 40 pages of guidelines on the currently utilized fee system. Ski area permittees and the public have a significant difficulty understanding this system. The new fee system that will be created by this legislation is set out on one page and is easy for everyone to understand. This legislation continues to receive bipartisan support and I hope that more Senators will join our effort to bring some common sense to how ski areas calculate their rental fees on the national forests. This legislation will reduce some of the management problems of the Forest Service. This simplification of the ski area fee system will eliminate the need for the Forest Service to apply and audit the complex rental fee system that they now have in their manual. The new fee system in this proposed legislation will reduce the fee system to a simple formula based on gross revenue of the ski area permittee and from clearly defined sources. Therefore. there will be a significant reduction in the bookkeeping and administrative tasks for both the Forest Service and the ski areas. I hope that hearing can be held soon on this legislation so that the now ski area fee system can be put in place as soon as possible. Simplification of this fee system is consistent with reinvention and downsizing the Federal Government.0 By Mr. LIEBERMAN:",

MCCAIN. and BENNETT. to introduce a bill of great importance to the mixedblood Utes. a native population of my home State of Utah. This limited legislation will restore the tax status of the mixed blood Ute Indians with regard to proceeds received from a trust created by the Federal Government as agreed in a settlement between the Federal Government and the Ute Tribe in 1954. Until recently. the Federal Government has respected the intent of Congress to exempt this income from Federal and State taxation. However. in a recent tenth circuit decision the court construed the intent of Congress as allowing the tax exemption on the settlement proceeds to lapse. This bill is necessary to clarify the legislative intent of Congress and reinstate the exemption. In my view. it was the intent of Congress in the 1954 settlement to exempt from Federal and State taxation the income derived from the assets held in continued trust by the Federal Government for. and paid to. the mixed blood Ute Indians. This has been the law for nearly four decades and should remain the law. Historically. with regard to all settlements between the Federal Government and numerous Indian nations. the proceeds from settlements have been exempt from Federal and State taxation. The mixed blood Ute Indians have been singled out and treated differently since the tenth circuits decision. This bill clarifies the 1954 settlement and simply restores the tax status of the mixed blood Utes. I believe all of my Senate colleagues will recognize this legislation as both fair and necessary. I am pleased to have the support of the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee as well as my Utah colleague. Senator BENNETT.

It is unfortunate because this is one of those instances where Democrats and Republicans have worked very well together. I think it is important that we point that out to the American people. I want to pay tribute to the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Connecticut on the Republican side. both of whom have been very active on this measure. the gentleman from Massachusetts . the gentleman from Pennsylvania . and the gentleman from Texas . who also have been active on the Democratic side. What we have shown here is. if the two parties have people in them who talk to each other and communicate. we can actually do things that move this country forward. This bill is an excellent example of a bill that will move this country forward because the lobbying disclosure provisions that have already passed the U.S. Senate under unanimous vote in July of this year are provisions that virtually everyone agrees with. These are provisions that will make it easier not only for the American people to know what is going on in Congress but actually make it easier for the lobbyists not to be buried in paperwork. It provides some streamlining provisions that make more sense. some commonsense proposals that have been introduced into this law. It also requires disclosure of who is paying whom how much to lobby. which Federal agencies and Houses of Congress. It is important for the American people to know who the people are that are sinking dollars into this institution. I think that this is a good step forward. It also closes some loopholes in existing lobbying registration laws. Probably most importantly. it covers all professional lobbyists. Unfortunately. with the loopholes that we have in the current law. there are too many people who can come and work the halls of this Congress but never have to actually register as lobbyists. So I applaud all the Members on both sides of aisle who have worked on this measure. and it is my hope that we move forward.

I had intended to offer that amendment because I believe very strongly that it is wrong for former Members to use their job here as a revolving door to cash in later on behalf of a foreign government. Currently there is a 1year ban on that activity. not a lifetime ban. Americans all across this land are very upset with the role that lobbyists play here in Washington and with good reason. All too often our elected leaders represent perhaps the most influential lobbyists rather than the people who elected them. Executive branch officials. I might note. are in fact barred for life from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. The underlying bill that we are taking up today. H.R. 2564. also bars U.S. trade officials from representing foreign countries for life. As we work to restore the public confidence in this Congress. we should apply that same standard to Members who serve here. I feel that we need to encourage folks to become public servants for the right reasons and that reward for helping people while you serve. not using that service to benefit our own pockets. It is not right that taxpayers send their representatives to Washington to fight for them and then that elected official leaves office and perhaps sells that knowledge to another government at the expense of the American people. Each of us were sent here to represent our own districts and our State and certainly our country. And it would be wrong for us to use that experience to represent someplace else.

The DAV. the Disabled American Veterans. works for the physical. social. mental. and economic rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. obtains fair and just compensation. adequate medical care. and oftentimes suitable gainful employment for wartime veterans who became disabled in service to our country.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise In opposition to the conference report for H.R. 2564. the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 1995. Mr. Chairman. this bill will prohibit military women who are stationed overseas from obtaining an abortion in a military hospital--even if they use their own money to pay for this procedure. Mr. Chairman. this provision of H.1-. 2564 will put the lives of military women In danger. because they will be forced to use thirdworld clinics or unsafe back alley facilities. It Is true that. as Representative YOUNG pointed our earlier. I voted yesterday for the conference report on H.R. 2020. the TreasuryPostal appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. I voted for this bill because I know that this measure is necessary to get our Nations Federal employees back to work. Under this bill. Federal employees will lose their ability to use their own health Insurance to pay for a full range of reproductive services. This is a travesty. and I fought against this provision when it was considered initially by the House. Nevertheless. I believe that there Is a critical difference between the antichoice provisions in the Defense appropriations bill and the TreasuryPostal appropriations bill. The difference is that when a military woman needs an abortion. and she Is stationed overseas in a thirdworld nation. the only medical facility which Is likely to be clean and safe. with well trained doctors. will be the base Hospital. Plain and simple. I cannot support a bill which denies military women the chance to use the only decent available medical facility. Today. the antichoice forces are hoping to score another victory by denying military women. who happen to be stationed overseas. access to a safe and legal abortion. Military women defend our country with their lives. Now their lives will be in jeopardy if the Defense appropriations conference report passes. Is this what you would want for your daughter? is this what you would want for your granddaughter? I urge my colleagues to protect a military womans constitutional right to reproductive choice.

It gives States sufficient time to take the necessary legislative or administrative actions to allow Medicare select policies to be sold in their states. It also allows insurers sufficient time to develop products. bring them to market. and accumulate enough experience for a meaningful evaluation of Medicare select policies. This legislation will allow people in all the States to have access to very popular. lower cost type of Medicare supplemental insurance. Remember. Medicare supplemental insurance is private insurance that people buy with their own money to cover medical expenses not paid for by Medicare. There is no Federal money involved. Some concerns have been raised about Medicare select. Since Medicare select is a new type of supplemental insurance and the full implications of Medicare select for the Medicare Program are not known. this legislation contains a safety valve. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is to study Medicare select. If the Secretary finds that Medicare select is saving seniors money on supplemental insurance. is not adding additional costs to the Medicare Program. and has not negatively affected quality or access to health care. Medicare select automatically becomes a permanent option after 3 years. If. on the other hand. the Secretary finds serious problems with Medicare select. the program expires This is a very sensible compromise.

In fact. the SEC in commenting on this provision of the bill that is before us said. and I quote them: One provision of section 102 requires the court generally to appoint as lead plaintiff the class member that has the largest financial interest in the case. Exactly the provision the Senator is addressing. The SEC then says: While this approach has merit. it may create additional litigation concerning the qualification of the lead plaintiff. particularly when the class member with the greatest financial interest in the litigation has ties to management. or interest that may be different from other class members. As I understand it. you permit having the largest financial interest to be a factor to be considered by the judge if all the plaintiffs cannot get together on who the lead plaintiff should be. Then the judge has to pick a lead plaintiff. and the Senator concedes the one factor to be looked at would be financial interest. But the bill as written provides the presumption to the large financial interest plaintiff which carries with it the risk. as the SEC points out. where the lead plaintiff may have ties to management or interest that may be different from other class members. As the Senator points out. they later found that out in the Keating case. Well. you say they will find it out in the beginning. They cannot find it out in the beginning. In fact. the bill as written denies the discovery in the early stages unless you already have a reasonable basis for doubting the lead plaintiff. This whole thing is structured in such a way that a lead plaintiff who has ties to the defendant. a party that has ties to the defendant. can end up being the lead plaintiff.",

I hope that other.Members will see that the amendment does not advocate opposition to concluding a comprehensive test ban and that it does not promote testing. With that in mind. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Arizona. As I understand the amendment. it would authorize the President to conduct underground nuclear weapons tests after October 1. 1996. if a comprehensive test ban treaty has not been ratified by the United States. In order to conduct an underground nuclear test. the President would have to submit a report to Congress detailing justification for the test. In order to stop the test from being conducted. the Congress would have to pass a joint resolution within 90 days. During the debate on the ExonHatfield legislation which prohibits nuclear testing. I voiced my concerns for the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile without the ability to test. So long as our defense relies on nuclear weapons. we must ensure the safety and reliability of the stockpile. That requires the authority to conduct underground nuclear tests.

For half a century. the center has been an integral part of the Tyndall community. serving the elderly with respect and compassion. Most importantly. the Good Samaritan Center ensures that its residents can continue to live close to their friends and loved ones. and in the towns in which many of them have spent their entire lives.

Juneteenth Day commemorates the day on which the last slaves in the United States learned of their freedom. While the Emancipation Proclamation. issued by President Mincoln on January 1. 1863. represents an important step in the AfricanAmerican populations quest for freedom and equality. Juneteenth Day. or June 19. 1865. marks the final abolition of slavery in the United States and thus occupies a special place in our Nations history. The celebration of Juneteenth Day in Milwaukee. WI. dates back to 1971 when the staff at Northcott Neighborhood House initiated the celebration. Juneteenth Day simultaneously pays homage to the AfricanAmerican struggle for freedom and equality. commemorates the end of slavery. and celebrates the rich and varied contributions of AfricanAmericans to the fabric of American society. This year. on the 25th anniversary of Juneteenth Day in Milwaukee. the contributions of several individuals were honored. I would like to take this opportunity to extend special recognition to Margaret Henningsen. whose extensive work in the community has touched the lives of many. and to the memories of Jan KempCole. Terrance Pitts. and O.C. White. all of whom made tremendous contributions to the Milwaukee community. The lives and work of these individuals embody the spirit of Juneteenth Day: A celebration of AfricanAmerican achievement. culture. and history. Juneteenth celebrations throughout the Nation serve to reaffirm the ideals. goals. and dreams of all AfricanAmericans. While much has been achieved in the years since President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. the fight for equality continues and we must pursue the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. that all children \"not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\" I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating Juneteenth Day. a day of freedom. pride. and dignity in the AfricanAmerican community.*",

Business NH Magazine and the Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives sponsor an annual event to recognize New Hampshire individuals and businesses making outstanding contributions to industry and community. Each year the sponsoring group receives hundreds of nominations. The exceptional quality of the entries gives testimony to the strength of Granite State businesses and the New Hampshire volunteer spirit. Dean Kamens record of achievement is certainly worthy of this outstanding honor. His inventions hold over 30 U.S. patents. he invented a lifesaving 22pound portable kidney dialysis machine. and he created a climate control system used by NASA. Dean has been recognized by President Clinton for his accomplishments and received the Hoover Medal. an international engineering honor. Dean Kamen is a visionary who wants to change the way children view science and technology. He would like to see our Nations children emulate scientists as much as they do sports heroes. His awardwinning and communityminded contribution for this year is the U.S. First program designed to inspire American children. Children from across the Nation work with engineers and compete in a technological version of \"American Gladiators.\" Dean is working on a new project and keeping it tightly under wraps. but I look forward to hearing about it in the future.

This treaty was the culmination of a very difficult negotiation with the Swiss. who long refused to deal with the problem of their banks. essentially. laundering gold looted from all over Europe by the Nazis. Yet. while the Swiss agreed to pay this sum. there was clearly more gold deposited in Switzerland by the Nazis during the war.

On an annual income of $8.400 a year. paying the bills and keeping food on the table is a daily challenge for minimum wage workers. The 90cent increase proposed by the President and Democrats in Congress would make the minimum wage a living wage. An extra 90 cents an hour would pay for 7 months of groceries. a year of health care costs. 9 months of utility bills. or 4 months of housing. Contrary to Republican rhetoric. the average minimum wage worker is not a teenager looking for a little extra cash. She is a working mother. often the only wage earner In her family. Let us not load up a minimum wage increase with all sorts of special breaks and goodies that would cause the President to veto the bill. Americas working families need an increased working wage. protections for their pensions. an effective education for their children. and affordable health care. Is that too much to ask?

The conferees have met ad nauseam the last 3 days. actually since Friday. and I think at this point virtually every issue seems to be resolved except the issues surrounding the environmental riders and two other issues. which I expect can be resolved. So it is my hope that when we reconvene meetings with Mr. Panetta at 2 or 2:30 today. that we will have agreement. To do so. the White House has made clear the remaining environmental riders. which are simply causing problems. will need to be dropped. or at least reshaped in a way that allows the President to protect the public interest as he sees it.

House Resolution 409 is an open rule which will allow full and fair debate on H.R. 2715. a bill to reduce the burden of Federal paperwork requirements for small businessmen and individuals. The bill. the Paperwork Elimination Act. follows last years enactment of the Paperwork Reduction Act. It is a continuation of Congress efforts to reduce the demands made on our citizens as a result of Federal regulation. As my colleague from Georgia has described. this rule provides 1 hour of general debate. equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Small Business. Under this rule. amendments will be allowed under the 5minute rule. the normal amending process in the House. All Members. on both aides of the aisle. will have the opportunity to offer amendments. This rule is an easy one for me to support. The normal committee process was followed before the bill was presented to the Rules Committee. The Small Business Committee held a public hearing to consider the bills provisions. Then the committee held a markup. amended the bill. and reported it by voice vote. Mr. Speaker. this is an example of the kind of rule the Rules Committee should be reporting. This is the kind of process the House should be following. I urge the adoption of the rule. Mr. Speaker.

H.R. 2715. the Paperwork Elimination Act of 1996. was originally referred to both the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and to the Small Business Committee. however. after reviewing the legislation as reported from the Small Business Committee. the Government Reform Committee waived jurisdiction to formally consider the bill. I believe that this legislation should be considered and passed without any delay. It is good for the Government and is good for those who are required to provide information to the Government. Moreover. it does not cost money. Mr. Chairman. this bill simply provides that the Government should take steps to allow. and even encourage. the use of electronic information technology in order to reduce the burden on individuals and businesses that disclose information to the Government. It does not require these information providers to use electronic means to supply the data. it merely permits them to do so If they have the capacity. and many do. Enactment of this bill will simply recognize that paper copies are not the only way to provide data to the Government. It may well be easier for citizens to transmit data electronically and it is certainly easier for the Government to receive it this way. Thus. I view this bill as a winner for all concerned. I know of no opposition to the bill. and I urge all Members to support it. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

In this age of growing technology. we should encourage and offer even more opportunities for small businesses to improve productivity through technology. H.R. 2715 will make it easier for many small businesses to provide information electronically to the Government. resulting in a reduced paperwork burden. I would caution though. this legislation Is not the answer to all small business problems. As the use of information technology flourishes. a gap is growing larger between the technology haves and the havenots. It is true that a great many Americans send and receive electronic mail with their personal computers. Many conduct bank transactions online. from home. The Internal Revenue Service reported that at least 11 million Americans filed their Federal income taxes electronically. But the whole truth is. the technology users I just described do not live in the lowerincome communities. like mine. Most of my constituents do not have access to technology. This means many of the small businesses in my community are quickly falling into the widening technology gap. These businesses cannot afford to hire experts to develop software applications. They will not be taking advantage of the electronic option provided by this billlet alone afford the expensive Initial investment in computer equipment. Although I encourage my colleagues to support this legislationkeep in mind that we need to take this bill a step further. We must continue to look for ways that will help small. disadvantaged businesses again access to information technology. If we fail to do so. we may very well lose one of the most vibrant sectors of our economy.",

I suggest they argue those semantics with senior citizens who will have to pay $1.000 more in extra Medicare premiums. deductibles. and copayments under the budget. I advise them to make that argument when seniors can not find a doctor to treat them because Medicare pays providers less and less. I will ask them to explain to my constituents why a Medicare cut three times bigger than any reduction ever enacted in the history of program does not represent real pain for senior citizens. Lot us not hide the facts. The Medicare cuts in the budget could decimate the only universal. portable health coverage we have in this country. When you combine these cuts with steep reductions in Medicaids coverage for nursing homes. the budget offers seniors a bitter pill to swallow. Some have said that these cuts are needed to save Medicare. America knows better. The same budget that cuts Medicare by $280 would also enact $345 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy. This is not a fair trade for our Nations seniors. Mr. Chairman. I have taken the tough votes to keep Medicare solvent and strong. In 1993. I voted to extend the solvency of Medicare by 3 years. and last year I voted in committee to extend the trust funds an additional 8 years.

While Congress has spent much time and effort. and is about to spend vast sums on measures to address crime committed by adults. it Is juvenile crime that is increasing exponentially. Particularly ominous. experts in the field report that while one can collect voluminous information on the national patterns and problems of adult crime and the adult criminal justice system. basic statistical data on the juvenile justice system is sketchy at best. Congress. States and localities have little or no comprehensive data on what the career record of a young offender looks like or how juvenile offenders flow through our countrys juvenile justice systems. A 1994 FBI study on major crimes reported that while the number of murders committed by adults 25 or older dropped 20 percent. the number of homicides committed by 1824yearolds Increased 65 percent. and those by 1417yearolds increased 165 percent. However. according to several experts who study juvenile crime. by the year 2005 the number of teenagers in this county will increase 23 percent. and youth crimes will Increase dramatically as well. To effectively address youth crime. the Federal Government and the States need clear. straightforward data on how the current juvenile system functions. I have worked closely with Dr. James Q. Wilson. the noted UCLA criminologist. to meet this need through the legislation I Introduce today. Dr. Wilson correctly pointed out that instead of fighting youth crime with grandiose rhetorical statements like harsh treatment and mollycoddling. it is time to address the issue with a commonsense look at the facts. There is a substantial amount of anecdotal evidence that indicates the juvenile system is in trouble. For example: In Portland. my hometown. the Oregonian. described a case where a child committed 50 crimes. 32 of which were felonies. before the juvenile justice system took action to protect the community. According to New York magazine. in New York State. 30.000 juveniles picked up for misdemeanors in 1993 were issued youth division",

If every other Government agency cut themselves back like we did. we would be threequarters down. $133 billion. the road toward a balanced budget In 1 yearnever mind the year 2002. We have set the standard and now its up to the other branches of Government to do their part. We must make Congress work better and at less cost to the taxpayer. To that end. we have defunded certain items. looking toward privatizing them. eliminated others which were redundant. reduced those which were bloated and recommended innovative ways to move Congress into the 21st century. The bill is structured to allow for privatizing many of the constituent related services including congressionally flown flags. historical calendars. and some mailing operations. We also eliminated redundant agencies and services. Among them. the Office of Technology Assessment [OTAI. the Joint Committee on Printing. one House parking lot. funding for the barber and beauty shops and the House restaurants. And remaining agencies have all been held at fiscal year 1995 levels or have been reduced greatly. This bill does what we said we would do last November. We are downsizing Government. making it work better for less. I ask that my colleagues support this effort.",

The American people want health care reformbut not health care reform that relies on onesizefitsall big Government solutions. Medical savings accounts will allow Americans to find affordable health care tailored to their personal needs. By allowIng businesses and Individuals to set up taxfree accounts to use for their health care expenses. this bill accomplishes three things. It makes health care more affordable and more accessible. and it promotes savings. One of the reasons health care costs have skyrocketed Is overuse and abuse of the system. By giving patients incentives to purchase health care more carefully. medical savings accounts will reduce the pressures that cause costs to rise. Medical savings accounts also increase access to health care. If you have your own account. you wont lose your health care if you change jobs or lose your job. Finally. MSAs promote personal savings. Nearly all of the economists who have come before the Ways and Means Committee agree on one thing: we badly need more savings. MSAs provide a savingsbased answer to the health care dilemma. Last year. the American people were denied meaningful health care reform because the administration took an allornothing big Government approach that left them with nothing. Our Incremental approach looks to be just what the doctorand the American peopleordered. Medical savings accounts legislation has long been a goal of mine. And now. this is an Idea whose time has come. I hope that my colleagues. on both sides of the aisle. will join me in supporting this legislation which will allow Americans to find better quality. more affordable health care.",

The legislation will comprehensively change the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act [OSHA]. Few Federal programs are In need of change as much as this one. I believe that OSHA has become fundamentally misdirected. and instead of promoting and encouraging workplace safety and health. OSHA has become known for issuing silly regulations and is preoccupied with collecting fines from unsuspecting employers. It is time to add some common sense to OSHAs regulations and focus on promoting safety in the workplace. Legislation that I am introducing today targets 50 percent of OSHAs funding toward consultation. training. education. and compliance assistance programs. Other important changes include adopting the regulatory reform measures already approved by the House. and giving employers the opportunity to fix alleged safety and health violations prior to the issuance of a citation. Finally. to save taxpayer dollars. this bill proposes the merger of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration with the Mine Safety and Health Administrationwithout compromising workplace safety.

I would argue that Bill Clinton has a rare gift for making speeches. But let us not forget one crucial thing. With Bill Clinton. there is always a huge difference between reality and his speeches. Let me illustrate. During his campaign for the Presidency. Bill Clinton argued passionately for deficit reduction and the need to balance the budget. In fact. in June 1992. Bill Clinton told Larry King that he would present a plan to balance the budget in 5 years. This never happened. For the last 3 years. the President has introduced budgets that called for more deficit spending. not less. His last budget. the one he just rejected last night. calls for $200 billion deficits well into the next century.

For years and years I have watched President after President threaten and warn Japan about their unfair trade practices. but finally President Clinton has ended the threats and has taken the decisive action that has been needed for many years. Cars and car parts account for most of the huge United States trade deficit we have with Japan. yet despite negotiations in good faith Japan has refused to remove the barriers that prevent United States automakers to compete. President Clinton has a record that clearly shows he is open to free trade. but now at the same time he shows he is willing to take forceful action against foreign unfairness.

To dismantle the program they depend on for their health care needs would be devastating. Medicare provides an invaluable and irreplaceable security for seniors. With the population of older Americans growing every year. Medicare must be strengthened and decisions must be made to support the program not break it down. The future of Medicare is critical not only for seniors but for all Americans who will someday need it. Although Congress must strive toward a balanced budget and address the solvency of Medicare. let us turn to other programs for cuts. not our seniors. Older Americans deserve our support.

I do not think the United States really and truly wants to extend our nuclear umbrella to the borders of Russia. I would like to remind the members that we are talking about. in the great scheme of things. we are talking about a very minuscule amount of money. The most successful foreign policy initiative that the United States has ever enjoyed was the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan saved Europe from communism.

It kept Europe from coming behind the Iron Curtain. It was done in a great bipartisan manner. It was not popular with the American people. It was an enormous amount of money. particularly compared to what we are doing today. I suggest that this modest investment in the newly independent states is in the same spirit as the Marshall Plan was. Finally. I would like to underline one more time that twothirds of this money. twothirds of this cut. are going to cut the hearts out of the programs that we have in the Ukraine. that we have in Armenia. that we have in Georgia and that we have in other countries which I not only cannot spell but I cannot pronounce.

Let me just make this comment: Presumably the Chair will consider whether the proper time to offer the Lowey amendment would have been during the authorization bill. During the authorization bill. we labored under a rule that ate up a considerable amount of time on some very important amendments. that ate up a long. long time of debate. There were dozens and dozens of amendments like this one that could have been offered that were not heard during that debate. Now. it seems to me that this kind of consideration of process puts the Members of this House in a Catch22 situation. You cannot legislate on an appropriations bill by attaching conditions to spending like this. That is our rule. And then you are supposed to pursue it in an authorization bill. But when the authorization bills come up. we have unduly restricted rules that cut off debate in an arbitrary time and never permit this kind of thing to come up. The real shame. Mr. Chairman. the real shame that is being raised by Mrs. LOWEYs amendment. is that such a meritorious and critical debate will never really happen and never really get a vote because of the way the rules of the House are being manipulated.

This is a good program. but this is the wrong time and the wrong place for IMET. For 3 years. Congress has denied IMET to Indonesia. A careful look at the record shows that this is no time to shift this policy. When Congress. at the urging of my predecessor. Ron Machtley. revoked Indonesian participation in IMET. a clear and unmistakable message was sent. We will no longer tolerate an intolerable situation. The human rights abuses in East Timor must end. Simply put. the abuses have not ended. IMET should not be restored. This amendment is most appropriate. considering recent assessments of human rights conditions in Indonesia. To quote from the State Departments 1994 human rights report. The Indonesian government continued to commit serious human rights abuses and in some areas. notably freedom of expression. it became markedly more repressive. The most serious abuse included the continuing inability of the people to change their government and harsh repression of the East Timorese dissidents. Restoring IMET at this time would run counter to these findings and would undermine the moral force of these findings. We have in Indonesia a situation where the benefits of IMET would be lost. The corruption is too deep. The violence is too extreme. And the repression is too severe for us to hold any hope that it can be tempered through education and training. IMET is designed to support democracy and military professionalism. and we cannot support what does not already exist. U.S. aid cannot fill this vacuum. IMET is a powerful and effective tool. It must be used in the right way at the right time. This is not the time. Only through continued pressure will we be able to have the opportunity for an improvement in East Timor.

I would note that the House Committee on International Relations has already recommended expanding IMET for Indonesia. and included it in the authorization bill passed by the full House on June 8. Also I note that because of the concern of the gentlewoman from New York. the committee report requires that all candidates for expanded IMET be carefully screened to make certain they have not been involved in past human rights abuses. I would hope under those circumstances that the gentlewoman would reconsider offering her amendment in light of the committees action on this very important amendment.",

Mr. Chairman. to rise in opposition to the gentlemans amendment is certainly a first for me. because we have voted 99 percent of th6 time together since we first came to this House 10 years ago. However. during the process of the responsibility I assumed on this subcommittee as its chairman. I think it became very. very important that we recognize that this subcommittee has a responsibility to this country and to the world. If we are going to be a participant in the world of international affairs. we are going to have to recognize that global environment has to be a part of that. In trying to put together the bill. we did assemble a bill that was very fragile. Each side compromised. I gave a little. the minority gave a little. We let everyone have as much input as we possibly could. Mr. Chairman. as the gentleman from Texas . will recognize. we cut the facility from $110 million to $50 million. I thought that was a compromise. I cannot. as eloquently as some who may follow me. stand up and defend the GEF. I can defend the fragile agreement that we have. the agreement that I put together that says if we will create child survival funds. if we will place our priorities on child survival. if we will reduce the level of overall spending. then I would compromise and go along with this request. provided they let me cut it from $110 million down to $50 million. Therefore. I commend the gentleman for the message that he gave. but I reluctantly rise in opposition to his amendment.",

The Bush and Clinton administrations have supported the GEF over more expensive alternatives. The GEF was completely reorganized and overhauled in 1994. and I think that many of the problems that have been mentioned here today have already been addressed. I would again suggest that the subcommittee. the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. has already cut the GEF by 50 percent. The cut that I am proposing would add another 10 percent. which would mean a 60 percent cut in this multilateral organization that I think still shows great promise for the environment. Mr. Chairman.

TroopstoTeachers has two parts. First. it provides financial assistance to service members to help them get the certification necessary to work as a teacher or teachers aide. Second. it provides funds over a 5year time frame to school systems that hire program graduates to defray the individuals salary costs in decreasing increments. This allows the school system the time to find the means of paying for that teachers salary. The statistics back up the value of the TroopstoTeachers Program. Over 8.000 individuals have applied to the program. Over 800 individuals are currently undergoing certification training in 45 states. Over 300 individuals have been hired so far in 35 States. 150 school districts nationwide are employing participants in this program.

The munitions industrial base has undergone dramatic reductions in the years following the Vietnam war. Built principally during World War 111. the base consisted of a large number of expansive. governmentowned manufacturing plants combined with hundreds of private sector major component and enditem manufacturing plants. and thousands of second and third tier subcontractor facilities. all designed to produce large volumes of munitions to fight another worldwide conflict. The end of the cold war triggered a comprehensive reassessment and restructuring of the national security strategy. Concurrently. the ammunition requirements of the Armed Forces were precipitously reduced and the production of ammunition declined to the lowest level since before the Vietnam war. This reduced business for the industrial base has decimated what was once a versatile. robust. and energetic industry. Of the 286 major munitions companies which existed in 1978 only 52 are projected to be in business by the end of 1995. an 82 percent reduction. At the same time the Government production base has shrunk by over 40 percent from 32 to 19 facilities. Only 9 of those remaining 19 plants are being actively workloaded with production. In light of these enormous changes. it is appropriate to review how the Department of Defense plans. budgets. conducts. and manages ammunition procurement and production. My amendment directs the Secretary to initiate such a review. aimed at restructuring the entire munitions infrastructure with three objectives in mind: Elimination of management/review layering in the planning. budgeting. and execution of ammunition programs. fixing the accountability for decisions. and reduction or elimination of Government ownership of production equipment and facilities. while preserving a robust and responsive ammunition production industrial base. Summed up. the overall objective of the study is to recommend those changes which will reduce the cost to the U.S. Government of providing munitions to our Armed Forces both in peace and during war while making the industrial base more responsive to our war fighters needs.",

The amendment directs the Secretary of the Army to review the service records of AsianAmericans and Native American Pacific Islanders who received the Distinguished Service Cross to determine whether the award should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. Under the direction of thenActing Secretary John Shannon. the Army is reviewing all Distinguished Service Cross EDSC] awards given to AfricanAmerican soldiers during World War II to determine whether any of these cases merited an upgrade to the Congressional Medal of Honor [CMR]. Mr. President. I offer my amendment to ensure that the Army conducts a similar study for AsianAmericans and Pacific Islanders who served during World War II. I am deeply concerned that this group of Americans may have also been discriminated against in the awarding of the CMH. The internment of JapaneseAmericans during World War II is a clear indication of the bias that existed at the time. This hostile climate may have impacted the decision to award the militarys highest honor to Asians. particularly JapaneseAmericans. The famed 100th Infantry Battalion/ 442 Regimental Combat Team. which performed extraordinary deeds in Europe. still has the unique distinction of being the most highly decorated unit of its size in American history. In fact. 47 individuals of the 442d Regimental Combat Team received the DSC. However. only one JapaneseAmerican who served during World War II received the CMH. this award was given posthumously after the war only when concerns were raised that not one American of Japanese descent who served in World War II had received the medal. Mr. President. my amendment only serves to ensure fairness for AsianAmericans and Pacific Islanders who so gallantly served their country during World War II. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Allied victory over the Axis powers. I think it is timely and appropriate that we undertake such a initiative. I hope that my colleagues will support this important amendment.",

The law establishing the Base Closure Commission authorized the Department of Defense to fund the operations of the Commission using fiscal year 1991 authorization. Unfortunately. the Departments 1990 estimate of the Commissions operating expenses fell short of actual requirement. This shortfall is due to the extensive travel required of the Commission to visit each base on the Secretary of Defenses closure list and attend the numerous hearings required to make the process as fair and open as possible. Additionally. the Commission had to purchase a new computer system to support its operation. Mr. President. in my judgment the Base Closure Commission has provided a valuable service to the Nation. The funding. which is estimated to be less than $300.000 is necessary for the Commission to archive at files and prepare the appropriate closeout reports.

I think that every one of the people who smeared House Speaker NEWT GINGRICH not only owe him an apology--and it should be a very direct and specific apologyfor the comments that the Senator from Georgia just read. but they owe an apology to the American people. because they. in smearing him. suggested that he was lying. that he was not telling the truth. that the allegations were unfounded. when. in fact. they either knew or should have known what was going on In the White House. why those clearances had not been granted. Therefore. it is they who were misleading the American public by suggesting that what he said was untrue. So I have been wondering for some time when we would receive an apology. and I think It is as important that the House Speaker receive an apology. I happened to see the Sunday morning talk show when Speaker GINGRICH said what he said. I saw him say it. and I thought at the time. \"Boy. he was certainly careful how he repeated that allegation because it was all over the news media.\" He was very careful in saying. \"Now. Im not making allegations. this is what a highranking official told me. and if It is true. its very bad.\" Well. all of the qualifications went out the window when all the White House pack dogs immediately attacked him the next day suggesting he was the one who was some kind of wild accuser here.

I believe there are people in our country. and some of them are In this administration. like former Surgeon General Elders. who believes the construction of the struggle was wrong. I believe that they believed rehabilitation Is more important that interdiction. so there are some philosophical differences here. We now have the results of the Interdiction law enforcement and education. It cut it In half. The new idesa. empirically. has failed. because It has doubled. but we still have people in this administration who do not agree with the war on drugs. Now. the last point I make. the war on drugs. I think the Senator makes a very valid point that it Is not something to ever be won or lost. I have called it a war on drugs. of late. because of the level. separate from usage in the United States. The fact Is. we have come into an era where drug cartels with their enormous capacity of resources and sophistication. In my Judgment. have put democracies In the hemisphere at stake. When the President of Mexico turns to me and says. \"The single greatest threat to my public are the drug cartels.\" that raises it to a new level. I think there is a war in the hemisphere to gain control of this circumstance so that it does not threaten fragile and small democraciessome of them rather large. I draw that distinction and separate the two. The Senator is absolutely correct. this Is an Issue for which society has always and will always struggle. Maybe it Is improper to characterize it as a war. That is a duty. It Is a duty of one civilization to those that follow. From time to time. I argue. there are incidentsand we are In onewhere -there is a configuration where we really are in a very adversarial struggle with a force that Is capable of undoing society.

Additionally. all of the funds provided for FOAKE by both the utilities and the Energy Department will be paid back to each as royalties on sales of the AP600 by Westinghouse and by General Electric on sales of its Advanced Boiling Water Reactor. Our companies entered the government partnership for the FOAKE portion of the ALWR program in February 1992. Later that year.

Congress recognized the time. costs. and risks associated with the process of developing and certifying new reactor designs. Congress has proceeded with this timely program. sharing those costs and risks so that new reactor designs will be a safe. costcompetitive option for future baseload electricity needs. Clearly.

I am proud to cosponsor this amendment and Join their efforts. Mr. President. this amendment restores our investment in the future of sustainable energy. Unfortunately. this Congress has out funding for renewable energy by 38 percent over the last two years. These cuts are shortsighted. To ensure that future generations can enjoy clean energy. we must maintain our commitment to support funding for research and development of solar. wind. and biomass energy. In particular. I firmly believe that Congress has a responsibility to reaffirm Its commitment to wind energy funding. Wind energy is now a $4 billion industry In the United States. Department of Energy funding has been key to this success by developing wind energy projects for commercialization. In my home State of Vermont. for example. Department of Energy funding for wind energy has helped develop a growing environmentallyfriendly industry. With DOE support. Vermont companies have developed stateoftheart wind turbines and other high technology products at wind energy projects in the Green Mountains of Vermont. In rural villages in Alaska and even on the top of the South Pole. And these DOEsupported projects have become proving grounds for Vermont companies to tap into a growing wind energy export market around the world. But the wind energy industry In Vermont and across the country Is at a critical stage in its development. European and Asian wind industrieswhich are heavily subsidized by their governmentsare emerging as competitive rivals. As a result. we must continue strong DOE funding to maintain Americas leadership role in the global wind energy market. Mr. President. this amendment makes sense for our future and our childrens future. Our children and grandchildren should be able to enjoy sustainable. clean and renewable energy. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

I rise in opposition to Congresswoman DELAUROS amendment to the defense authorization bill which would nullify requiring the immediate discharge of HIVpositive personnel and banning abortions in military hospitals overseas. Contrary to the arguments presented by the other side of the aisle. discharging servicemembers who have contracted the HIV1 virus is not punitive nor discriminatory. The fact is. retaining HIVpositive personnel degrades unit readiness and creates a class of individuals who are unable to deploy if their units are called upon. Those infected often require reassignment and continued restrictions on future assignments because of health related concerns and their inability to serve in combat units. In addition. the military regards all personnel as potential blood donors. Since HIVinfected personnel may not give blood. they detract from available resources. The opposition has also resorted to scare tactics on abortion. The issue at hand Is abortion in facilities funded by the taxpayer. Servicewomen and military dependents will now be asked to utilize private facilities to obtain abortions overseas except in the Instances of rape. incest. and the life of the mother. Women will not be forced to seek illegal. or unsafe procedures as propagated by the other side of the aisle. However. American taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize clinics performing this practice when many of those taxpayers find this procedure abhorrent.

In many countries where our military forces are called upon to serve. women who make the diificult choice to have an abortion are unable to obtain a safe abortion locally.

I am concerned that small. seaskimming. antiship cruise missiles are today in the hands of more than 100 countries. Thousands of lives and an enormous investment in capital ships. equipment. and supplies are potentially at risk because of the proliferation of. and the threat posed by. these missiles. While the Navy has improved its radar capabilities to detect small targets in open ocean sea clutter. clutter levels over typical littoral waters. relative to the open ocean. are far more severe. Consequently. in order to address the problem posed by these small. seaskimming missiles. Congress has appropriated $30.3 million over the past 3 fiscal years to develop an upgrade to the primary radar used by aircraft carriers and big deck amphibious ships. Unfortunately. due to lengthy delays in releasing these funds. the radar upgrade modification program was not initiated until February of this yearand then only $6 million was put under contract. Moreover. the Vice Chief of Naval Operations recently informed the Congress that only $3 million in additional funds have been allocated by the Navy for this program through the remainder of this fiscal year. Despite the danger posed by these cruise missiles. the Navy did not fund continuation of this upgrade in its fiscal year 1995 budget. Recent communications with senior Navy officials have raised doubts as to whether Navy will request funds for this program in fiscal year 1997. Mr. Chairman. I understand that seeking additional funds in fiscal year 1996 for production of the upgrade modification kitgiven the fact that the Navy has only recently begun to develop itmay be premature. However. I believe this program is one that deserves our consideration. I would ask the chairmans assurance that he will look into the Navys plans for this radar upgrade development and lend his support to its production and implementation as soon as is possible.",

What they were concerned about is this years Defense Authorization Act which contains a provision which expresses the concern of Congress that growth in the estimated cost of demilitarizing the U.S. stockpile of chemical agents is growing quite rapidly. That is correct. The cost of demilitarizing the existing stockpile of lethal agents. and incidentally a lot of Members are concerned about the fact that we are spending about 72 percent less in terms of modernizing our Navy and our Army and our Marine Corps with sufficient ships and planes and other systems. One reason is we have a lot of spending that is going to traditionally small areas. like the environment. that are growing rapidly. and one other reason is we are spending money on areas such as this demilitarization of chemical agents. That is a fact. It is taking quite a bit of money. The cost of demilitarizing this existing stockpile that we are now cutting down has grown to about $11.8 billion. in comparison to an early estimate we made of about $1.7 billion.

This provision directs the Secretary of Defense not to implement any reduction in strategic nuclear forces called for in the START II Treaty unless and until the treaty enters into force. Mr. Chairman. the cold war is over and everyone else has figured it out. An April nationwide poll shows that 82.3 percent of Americans believe that the United States and Russia should agree to negotiate deep reductions in their nuclear weapons arsenals. This amendment flies in the face of the desire for those reductions. The current practice is that as long as the Russians are dismantling their weapons. we continue to do so as well. I see no reason to stop that practice. Following last falls conclusion of the Nuclear Posture Review. Secretary of Defense Perry advocated a policy he called leading and hedging. explaining by saying. \"By leading I mean providing the leadership for further and continuing reductions In nuclear weapons. so that we can get the benefit of the savings that would be achieved by that. At the same time. we also want to hedge. hedge against the reversal of reform in Russia . . . We do not believe that reversal is likely. and we are working with Russia to minimize the risk of It occurring.\" If we were to actually honor the provisions of Representative HOKEs senseofCongress amendment and keep all our unclear weapons. it could require the additional expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. These funds would be required for such activities as maintaining more B52 bombers and the possible purchase of additional D5 missiles for Trident submarines. Mr. Chairman. in this postcoldwar era. we have more important things to do than continue to maintain ridiculously high levels of nuclear weapons.

These decisions will have a lasting impact on how America meets the 21st century and whether our workers and companies will have the tools to compete. I take my responsibility to make sure that America goes into the future strong and prepared very seriously. America has the most skilled. productive. and dedicated workers in the world. Despite vocal naysayers predictions about the American economy declining In the face of International competition. I have found the opposite to be true. I did not have to go far to find proof. There are 6.000 hardworking people in Smyrna. TN who go to work every day at the Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. with the attitude that \"every day we want to do better than we did yesterday.\" Those words came from Nissan CEO and President Jerry Benefield who has proven that rewarding hard work and making sure that employees know they have the power to createor breaktheir company. Those Smyrna Nissan employees have reason to be proud. They have built the most productive car and truck assembly plant in America for the second year in a row. One of the secrets of their success is attitude. Another is their extensive training and knowhow. Those are the two keys that set not only the Smyrna plant apart from other American plants. but also what sets American companies apart from the rest of the world. Smyrna employees assemble a car in just 2.2 worker days. setting the benchmark for national productivity. I want to congratulate and thank the 6.000 of you who earned this recognition on behalf of Smyrna. It goes to show that Tennessee. and America. are poised to take the lead in innovation and productivity. All of you are obviously going above and beyond just doing your joband doing it very successfully.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last Friday. I had the pleasure of touring a school In my district which Is setting the trend for the future of education. Mason Middle School. in Warren County in southwest Ohio. uses a stateoftheart technologydriven curriculum so that students can easily enter the hightech workplace and adapt to a changing world. If our world is transitioning to an informationbased society. these students will be way ahead of the curve. As our current methods of production become obsolete. more and more work will have to do with Information processing. Because of Mason Middle Schools emphas.s on information and technology. its students are being given the skills to compete in the work force of the future and the confidence to succeed there. Students also learn to appreciate the interconnectedness of the world. preparing them to interact in a global economy. When we create schools such as this. we are doing more than providing for our childrens success in an age of everexpanding technology. We are laying the groundwork for a new political system. Our system is based on democracy. or the will of the people. To express the will of the people. we rely on representation. Computers will make our system of representation more responsive. What began with polling by mail and then phone has evolved into direct communication and declsionmaking. Instead of relying on our Senators or Congressmen and women to represent us. in the future. we can begin to represent ourselves. A democratic system can only be effective with an informed and engaged electorate. Technology will bring us even closer togethercreating a more participatory democracy. Using todays far more advanced computers. satellites. telephones. cable. polling techniques. and other tools. not to mention the Internet and other communication networks. an educated citizenry can. for the first time in history. begin making many of its own political decisions. Id say thats pretty exciting stuff. And I would also say that I am very proud that a school In the Second Congressional District is leading the way.",

And the worst is yet to come. because many of the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster will not be known until later this decade. There is a desperate need for this aid. Ukraine faces a severe shortage of medical supplies and effective health care. Our aid to Ukraine and other New Independent States is less than 10 percent of the foreign aid budget. which is less than 2 percent of our Federal budget. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to pay tribute to a dedicated individual from my district who has provided her community with quality mail service for 54 years. Even more remarkable is that she plans to continue to do so. Patricia M. Drake. a 71yearold granumother of four. began work as a mail clerk in 1941. when mail was sorted one letter at a time. Although technology now enables mail to be processed en mass. it is the dedication and reliability of individual Postal Service employees such as Pat Drake that provides this Nation with the most productive. efficient. and costeffective mail system in the world. When Pat was hired. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was President and a war was raging in Europe. Pat initially worked weekends and summers. sorting Vmail that came in by train to help people communicate. Now. more than 54 years later. Pat is still working weekends and evenings sorting mail to help people communicate. And she would not have it any other way. According to her colleagues. Pat is wellloved and respected because she personifies all that is good about the Postal Service. Her sound integrity and reliability are an asset to the two offices in which she works. While the methods have changed. the basic mission of both Pat and the Postal Service remains as important today as it has ever been. and perhaps even more so in this fastpaced information age. With data whirling by us via email. fax. interactive cable. and other. yettobe developed supertechnologies. we must not lose sight of the basic service that Pat renders. which is so important to our continued wellbeing. Pats contribution. along with that of others. enables 125 million American households to receive prompt. universal mail service. 6 days a week. at just about the lowest rates in the industrial world. Pats career. and the honors that have come her way recently. have been recounted in the following story written by Tracy Valentine in the Watertown Daily Times. Mr. Speaker. it is my honor to pay tribute to Pat Drake for giving 54 years of dedicated service to the communities of Theresa and Watertown. NY. and to wish her continued success in all her endeavors. [From the Watertown Daily Times. Apr. 30. 1995]",

The language of the amendment before us is so broad and vague that it would subject an American citizen to criminal liability and possible imprisonment for two years. a $100.000 fine or both for making what is termed a \"filthy comment\" on the internet which. in the words of the amendment. is intended to annoy. Annoying filthy comments that are put on the internet are reprehensible. But. I am afraid the attempt to make such language criminal will backfire and make it more difficult for us to effectively prohibit abusive and threatening activities and pornographic material aimed at children and adults. Our best chance to meet this objective is through means which are Constitutional. That is why I support the underlying Leahy amendment to protect the internet and other electronic media from obscene material. The Leahy Amendment would require the Attorney General of the United States within 150 days to produce Constitutional legislation to address the problem. The Leahy Amendment also provides for expedited procedures which would permit the Congress to consider such legislation quickly. I believe this is the more effective course to protect the internet and other telecommunications media. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have a letter printed from the Department of Justice at this point in states. in part. \"Defenses included in the Exon proposal would undermine the ability of the Department of Justice to prosecute an online service provider even though it knowingly profits from the distribution of obscenity or child pornography.\" The Department of Justice letter also states that for many other reasons a comprehensive review should be made before Congress acts.",

We hear a lot of discussion about let us lower some of those overwhelming taxes that we have imposed on the American working people. I say let us just do it. We have heard a lot of talk about how we change welfare. how we admit that welfare programs have been unsuccessful for the last 40 years and they need changing because we have taken the spirit away from people by giving them something for nothing. In changing the welfare program. I say just do it. It is like the Nike ad on just doing it.

But if you had to choose the three people who played the biggest Tote in relegating communism to the dustbin of history it would have to be Ronald Reagan. Pope John Paul II. and a shipyard worker from Gdansk named Lech Walesathe three men Time Magazine dubbed \"The Holy Alliance.\" The centerpiece of the operation to free Eastern Europe from the chains of communism was Solidarity. the workers union founded by Lech Walesa. Everything else flowed from that. Solidarity was the weapon that the Pope and President Reagan nurtured and protected and eventually used to help bring about communisms collapse. first in Poland. then in the rest of Eastern Europe. None of what was accomplished. however. could have happened wvithout Lech Walesa. It was his bravery. his skill. his dedication. and his love for his country and its people that showed the way. The world owes an debt of gratitude to this common man with uncommon valor. Last week a ceremony was held in Washington both to honor this hero. as well as to elebrate the introduction of the NATO Expansion Act. a bill that will bring Poland. Hungary. and the Czech Republic into NATO. In many ways this bill is the culmination of all the Mr. Walesa has worked for and I am proud not only to be an original cosponsor of this bill. but also that I had a hand in drafting some of the language.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we consider the fiscal year 1997 Agriculture Appropriations Act. I want to take this opportunity to inform my colleagues of another Clinton administration attack on California agricultural jobs. Six thousand American avocado growers and 21.000 avocado industry workers are in danger of losing their livelihood should the USDA implement its proposed plan to modify the quarantine on Mexican Hass avocados. The quarantine was placed in 1914 to protect our avocado crops from Mexican pests and fruit flies. During a trip to Mexico City. USDA Secretary Dan Glickman spoke about lifting the current ban. He continues to tell me that he is \"absolutely committed to a sound. wellfounded. sciencebased decision on this proposal.\" This is what I expect from the USDA. However. Secretary Glickman continues to ignore the warnings of independent scientists at the University of California Riverside and elsewhere that infestation of pests from Mexico is very likely if the quarantine is lifted. The USDA believes that Mexico can handle their serious pest problem. But. science has proven that Mexico has failed for years to destroy pests. NAFTA specifically left the quarantine intact because our Government knows that Mexican pests would devastate American avocados. The University of California Center for Exotic Pest Research released an important report based on their studies. entitled \"Risks of Exotic Pest Introductions from Importation of Fresh Mexican Hass Avocados into the United States.\" Secretary Glickman must carefully consider the results of this report before a final rule is made. Mexican pestinfested avocados have already been smuggled across our border. On January 5. 1996. the U.S. Customs Service confiscated and destroyed 3.337 pounds of Mexican Hass avocados at the Otay Mesa commercial facility in San Diego County. The driver. who had previously been arrested for the same offense. admitted to similar smuggling activities in recent months. Although U.S. Customs officials thought they were seizing a truck loaded with drugs. they definitely touched on a problem of significant concern to Californias avocado growing region. It is evident that the USDA proposal will only harm our country. I encourage my colleagues to give me a call. should any of you have questions about this plan to destroy the crops and lives of American avocado growers and workers. We must stop this attack against California jobs.",

I would suggestand it would be an interesting responsethat the influence of newspapers is absolutely minuscule. Regrettably the influence of these editorial writers is minuscule compared to the power of television.

I will once again return to what I began with. So far the arguments. as I have heard them on the floor here today. are that the polls. the newspapers. and the people do not like the present system. and they want campaign election reform. This proposition 2this bill is entitled \"Campaign Election Reform.\" Conclusion: We should pass this bill. Mr. President. I do not believe that to be the case. This bill will not end up restoring confidence in the political system. It will force money into different channels. channels which neither this bill nor any other bill can control. one for which the candidates will be less responsible. and not more I think responsible in any respect whatsoever. The Senator from Utah in beginning this debate said that the appropriate solution was not limitation but disclosure. I agree with him. That is the thrust of an opinion based by Larry Sabato. a political scientist at the University of Virginia which is frequently quoted on these subjects. Mr. President. we should be willing to trust the American people. as he puts it. with sorting out their own ideas as long as they know the source of those ideas and the source of the money to communicate those ideas. That is appropriate election reform. The Senator from Arizona said. \"Well. why dont you put it up as an amendment after voting for cloture on this bill?\" Mr. President.

Second of all. if I could just comment. the Senator knows what section 324 means: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act. no person. other than an individual or political candidate. may make a contribution. The Senator knows that unions cannot contribute directly right now. Corporations cannot contribute directly right now. and all it does is say political action committees cannot contribute right now. and the reason political action committees should not be allowed to contribute is because the system in America is so skewed and so unfair that no challenger has a chance. As I said in my opening remarks. if the challengers were voting today. I say to the Senator from Washington that this bill would be passed in a New York minute. So the fact is that what this does is it bans political action committees. It does not ban individuals. We have already placed restrictions on free speech by limiting the amount that an individual can contribute. So I would say to the Senator from Washington that perhaps it is a great idea just to have total disclosure and complete freedom as far as any contribution is concerned. This bill does require disclosure. This bill does require soft money to become hard money. and it also places some reasonable restraints. and they are voluntary. They are voluntary. We have the Congressional Research Service and other constitutional opinions stating that this is constitutional. I respect the Senators opinion. but I certainly cannot allow him to get by with saying we are restricting anyones freedom of speech when we ban political action committees where the common practice is that the Senator from Washington and I go to a lunch someplace. dinner here someplace in Washington. and are given a $1.000. $2.000. $3.000. $4.000. $5.000 check or groups of checks.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation that will relieve nursing homes of unnecessary regulation without jeopardizing the high quality of care nursing home residents receive. These two bills. which enjoy bipartisan support. will improve longterm care in this country by giving nursing homes the flexibility they need to focus scarce resources on providing quality care. I have long believed that the Federal Government has an important role to play in ensuring against the kinds of abuses that occurred in some areas of the country prior to enactment of Federal nursing home standards. I do not believe that those abuses were the norm in nursing homes. In fact. nursing homes in my State of North Dakota have a strong record of providing quality care. and I believe that this was the case in most nursing homes. But it is clear that some nursing homes did not meet that high standard. and many States were far too slow to respond. To address that critical problem. I supported and continue to support minimum Federal quality standards. Our first priority in nursing home legislation must be the quality of care provided to residents. and we should not pass any laws that would compromise that goal. However. I believe that some of our efforts to regulate nursing homes have not resulted in greater quality of care for residents. In some cases. by imposing unnecessary burdens and diverting scarce resources in nursing facilities. these laws and regulations can hinder the delivery of quality care. The legislation I am offering today will address two such instances.",

Dr. Greenspans impressive career includes three decades of work with a private sector economic consulting firm. during which time he held the positions of both chairman and president of the company. Other distinguished achievements include chairmanship of President Fords Council of Economic Advisers. membership on President Reagans Economic Policy Advisory Board and consulting work for the Congressional Budget Office. And as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for the past 8 years. Dr. Greenspan has won the respect and confidence of Republican and Democrats alike and consistently steered American monetary policy on a prudent and responsible course. Mr. President. the economy is strong and growing. Inflation Is under control. and mortgage rates have averaged 7.8 percent. the lowest since Lyndon Johnson was in the White House. Much of this success is due to the constancy and apolitical management of our countrys monetary policy. And while I will support reforms of Fed management to ensure that taxpayer funds are used responsibly. I will not support efforts to subject the Federal Reserve to political influence. Considering his past record and looking to the future. Alan Greenspan deserves reappointment.

Small business has had to contend with a literal blizzard of Government regulation in virtually every aspect of their operations. It is not just one or two big or major impacts from regulations. it is also death by a thousand cuts. It is the cumulative burden of paperwork. planning. and other compliance requirements that are often overlooked in the process of creating Federal regulations that are especially burdensome to smaller businesses. Mechanisms like those contained in H.R. 1022 will help to ensure that Government considers the total impact of the cumulative regulatory burden. The small businesses impacted by many new regulations. especially in the environmental and worker safety area. do not have the resources to challenge or assess the increasingly scientific methods or exposure assumptions used by Federal agencies to justify new regulations. Discussion and provision of regulatory options and risk scenarios early in the regulation development process will help small business by focusing resources and providing at least some assistance In an analysis process they cannot hope to shoulder on their own behalf. In short. small business needs H.R. 1022 so that Federal agencies will be compelled to develop costeffective regulations that will allow small businesses to both comply and remain economically viable.",

Our House Republican rescission package represents a crucial first step toward achieving this goal. The taxpayers want an economically sound government that lives within its means. The American family exercises fiscal responsibility and accountability. The Federal Government should do the same. The American people work hard for the tax dollars they have to send to Washington. The least we can do is spend those dollars wisely. These bills take a first step in that direction. They aim the cutting knife at programs that do not work. and consolidates duplicative government functions. Furthermore. our rescission bills trim funding for programs that received large increases in fiscal year 1995. cuts unspent funds that were piling up from one year to the next and eliminates funding for unauthorized programs. Mr. Speaker. the $17.3 billion worth of specific cutbacks in our rescission bills. H.R. 1158 and H.R. 1159. put this Nation back on the path toward fiscal responsibility. These bills reassure Americans that their dollars will go to the programs they need most while eliminating useless ones.",

The year 1995 marks the chiropractic professions centennial. In 1895. Daniel David Palmer founded the chiropractic profession and opened the first chiropractic school in Davenport. Iowa. in 1897. The profession has come a long way since 1895. Today. more than 50.000 chiropractors serve 15 to 20 million patients. The improved standards of education and quality of practice has given rise to the tremendous growth in this field. While early chiropractors had difficulty gaining acceptance in the health care field. they now enjoy broad support from the public and their fellow health care professionals. Chiropractic care is now widely recognized as one of the most effective and efficient treatments for back ailments. especially for sufferers of severe or chronic back pain. An increasing number of Nevadans rely on the choice and freedom in health care options that chiropractic care offers them. Recognizing this trend. Congress provides for chiropractic care In Medicare and authorizes chiropractors to be commissioned as officers in the Armed Forces. Mr. Speaker. as a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. I admire the dedication of my fellow health care professionals and their contribution to the enhancement of the quality of life for so many Americans.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing the Landfill Technical Improvement Act of 1995. This is the same legislation that my former colleague Al Swift and I introduced late in the last session of Congress. I am introducing the legislation again this year because the illadvised and outmoded regulation which prompted this bill still exists at the expense of small domestic companies who seek to compete in the growing national and International environmental technology markets. Of course. Congress did not intend this result when we passed the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments in 1984over one decade ago. This act required the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA) to issue regulations restricting the disposal of organic sorbents in hazardous waste landfills. Since that time. natural absorbents made from reclaimed/recycled materials have been developed which actually outperform traditional sorbents produced from fossil fuels and chemicals. As well. normal landfill conditions are anaerobic. and studies show that no blodegradation occurs in this anaerobic environment of RCRA landfills. A small company in my State is among those companies who produce this type of material. They take a local paper mills sludge. garbage. and produce useful. organic sorbents. This disposition issue. however. continues to threaten the existence of these American companies and the new technologies they have developed. As .it now stands. this regulation effectively shuts out these new technologies from landfill disposition. The administration has repeatedly stated its support for American manufacturers of new environmental technologies as they attempt to compete in the world marketplace. This regulation. however. Is highly detrimental to these stated goals. This bill would reverse this injustice by allowing this new technology to be utilized to its fullest extent. thus providing American jobs while advancing our national environmental goals.",

Well. American workers. are you ready to compete? Do you think maybe we can get down to 18 cents an hour? We can get those Jobs back. What about 15 cents an hour? To a large degree much of the discussion of the global economy is just that. It is asking American workers to lower their wages. give up their benefits. sacrifice our environmental standards in order to compete with desperate Third World countries where people are working for starvation wages. I think. as Mr. HINCHEY indicates. that should not be the paradigm under which we operate. Rather. we should be asking the question. why. in this great country. do we not develop policies which create decent paying jobs for all of our workers. a national health care system guaranteeing health care to all of our people. a fair tax system which takes the burden of taxes off the middle class and asks the wealthy to start paying their fair share of taxes. educational opportunity for all.

Already we have year after year reduced the number of grants available. The poorest young people going to college. we used to provide more grants. But we have steadily reduced the number of grants. so it is very hard to qualify for a grant. You have to be very poor. because the amount of Pell grants available. the amount of money available for Pell grants is very low. We have deliberately emphasized student loan programs. Because after all. you have time to pay for it after you get out of college and get a decent job. Most of our aid now is in the form of student loans. Now the Republicans are saying the student loan program should not be subsidized at all. What we do now is while a young person is in college. the interest on the loan is paid for by the Government. That is our contribution as taxpayers towards the student loan program. The students get out. pick up the loan. and they start paying the interest and principal until it is paid off. But the interest during the time they are in college is paid for by the Government. and if you take that away. that raises the amount the students owe.

Southwestern. and especially the Southeastern Power Administrations to private investors. In Virginia. the electric cooperatives and the municipal power systems represent almost a million citizens who receive a significant portion of electricity from the KerrPhilpott hydro facilities located in southside Virginia. It is estimated that preferred customers under the electric cooperatives can expect annual increases of approximately $100 per year should the Southeastern Power Administration be sold. I believe that it is fiscally irresponsible to turn the Power Marketing Administrations over to private interests. which will in turn penalize our consumers by driving up their rates. These members have already paid for a significant portion of investment in these facilities and nearly twice that amount in interest. SEPA has already repaid $433 million. or 30 percent. of the $1.442 invested. The Federal Government is currently recovering its investment in SEPA facilities through the rates charged for the hydroelectric power generated to the customers in southside. This investment should be viewed as a contract with the ratepayers of the cooperatives to continue service with the Federal Government. While the sale of the PMAs would provide the Department of the Treasury with the desired instant cash flow. we must consider how these Federal power sales will continue to generate revenue long after the projects are repaid. The Power Marketing Administration should be valued for its assets. for the income it produces to pay its own way. and for the service it provides to the members of the cooperatives. For these reasons. I believe that the sale of the Power Marketing Administrations is not an efficient means of contributing to deficit reduction and should not be considered as a means of deficit reduction.",

We seem to go through this exercise just about every year. regardless of who is in the White House or who controls Congress. Until someone can show me some real benefits of privatization. I will continue to oppose the sale of the PMAs. The Power Marketing Administrations deliver a critically important service to a large portion of the Nation. They are an example of whats right with Government. It seems ironic and very ill advised that they should be put on the auction block and I will not stand for any wholesale dismantling of the PMA system.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have spoken In the past about my commitment to continuing the production and distribution of clean. reliable hydropower through Federal Power Marketing Administrations. Today. I reaffirm this commitment. The Federal power program has served well both the taxpaying public and energy consumers. It serves the taxpaying public by paying its own wayand paying interest on its debt. It also serves the general public by providing navigation. flood control. recreation. fish and wildlife conservation. and Irrigation. Few Federal programs can claim such farreaching benefits at such a low cost. Mr. President. if we sell our PMAs. we cannot be assured that the general public will continue to reap these many benefits. While the sale of PMAs would product shortterm revenue. the sale will do little to solve the longterm problem of our Nations debt. In fact. the permanent loss of these productive assets will result in foregoing future revenues likely to be in the billions of dollars. At this time. the Bonneville Power Administration is not immediately threatened with sale. Several months ago. however. officials within the administration suggested to the President that he sell BPA to finance a tax cut. Fortunately. after hearing from Senators and Representatives from the Pacific Northwest. President Clinton elected to decline that advice. Recognizing the special attributes of BPA. he has said he does not intend to offer it for sale. So. my constituents appear to be safe for now. I speak in opposition to the sale of the other PMAs because I believe their sale is not in the best interest of either the taxpaying public or the tens of millions of consumers who will certainly be saddled with higher electricity bills. Let us reject this shortterm solution to our deficit and protect our Federal assets for the next generations of Americans.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join with a number of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who have come to the floor this morning to shed some light on proposals to sell off the Federal power marketing administrations. I continue to oppose such proposals. not only as they relate to the Bonneville Power Administration. but also as they relate to the other power marketing administrations. Power Marketing Administrations are entities that have been created to market the power generated by Federal hydropower projects operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. PMAs are part of the Department of Energys Federal power marketing program. One of the central features of this program Is the preference clause. which allows consumerowned. nonprofit local utility systems to have the preferential access to the power produced by Federal dams. The five PMAs are as follows: The Southeastern Power Administration [SEPA]. the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA]. the Western Area Power Administration [WAPA]. the Bonnville Power Administration [BPA]. and the Alaska Power Administration [APA]. The Presidents budget includes provisions for the sale of each of these PMAs except BPA. Proposals are pending in the House to either sell all or some of the PMAs or require them to sell their power at market rates. the definition of which appears to this Senator to lead to highly inflated and unrealistic prices. My opposition to the sale of the PMAs is based on my view that it is shortsighted public policy to sell one of the few revenue generating assets of the Federal Government. It is important to remember that BPA is repaying. with interest. the capital investments in the Federal hydropower projects in the Columbia Basin. The other PMAs are making similar payments. When the repayment is completed. the Federal Government will be the owners of these projects. The PMAs pay their way and then some. I ask unanimous consent that a table showing project investments and repayment by PMAs be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to voice my opposition to any efforts to privatize parts of the Federal Power Marketing Administrations including the Southwestern. Southeastern. or Western Area Power Administration. This Nation made a commitment to bring affordable and efficient hydroelectric power to rural customers. In conjunction with thousands of rural cooperatives and municipal power systems across the country. Federal Power Marketing Administrations [PMAs] have met that commitment. The utilities purchase power through the PMAs and the revenues cover PMA operating expenses. construction costs. and interest payments. And these sales put money into the Federal Treasury. The proposed sale of these PMAs not only jeopardizes that commitment to rural Americans. but upsets the sensitive dynamics of the many dam projects from which the PMAs market their power. These dams perform an array of services. Including power generation. navigation. flood control. water supply. recreation. and fish and wildlife preservation. As a government entity PMAs have effectively balanced these sometimes diverse. and often competing functions. As several colleagues and I told President Clinton in a letter back in January. there is no indication that a private. forprofit entity can be expected to become a fullpartner in these interests at an almost certain loss of profits. And what about the consumer? They essentially lose twice. Estimates show increases of as much as 30 to 50 percent per month for some residential rates. Thats a frightening prospect for many families who are already living from paycheck to paycheck. The consumer gets hit a second time when the Federal Treasury experiences a loss of that steady revenue I mentioned earlier. Because the Federal Power Program pays for all investments made. once construction. and interests costs are repaid. the Federal Government will own the power plants. But once sold. no revenue. And thats bad news for consumers at a time when reducing the deficit is critical to continued economic stability. The Federal Power Program is one that assures access for rural residents to affordable electricity. returns muchneeded revenue to the Federal Treasury. and effectively balances the many demands on these dams--from flood control to water supply to recreation. Clearly. this is not the kind of program Congress should add to the auction block. and I urge my colleagues to oppose any such efforts.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague. I would like to speak just briefly on the PMA matter and then speak on another issue as well. With respect to the PMA matter. I salute my colleagues who have come to the floor to oppose the sale of PMAs. Let me say I believe sale of the Power Marketing Administrations represents a very bad idea. It is bad for rural America. It represents bad faith. It is bad economics and it is bad policy. This would have a very serious impact on rural America. In my State we would see an increase in rates of up to 60 percent. 240.000 customers in North Dakota would be adversely affected. Those rural customers are already paying rates that are 15 to 40 percent higher than city customers. The reason for that. of course. is very obvious. There is much less of a load per mile in rural areas than in city areas. so the costs are higher. Mr. President. this would be a very serious matter for rural America. It also represents bad faith. The Government made a deal. The deal was this power was going to go to help rural America. That is precisely why the Federal Government entered into this enterprise. Preference power. it should be emphasized. is not a subsidy. These facilities are being repaid with interest. I believe the sale also represents bad economics. Selling the PMAs would be a onetime shot. It does not reduce the deficit because their own budget rules say you cannot sell assets to reduce the deficit. So. Mr. President. selling these facilities forgo decades of steady income. Finally. I believe the PMA sale represents bad policy. These dams serve multiple purposes. No private entity can balance the interests of power production with flood control. navigation. water supply. and wildlife values. Mr. President. for those reasons I oppose the sale of the PMAs.",

Two years ago. this body passed a similar bill. but the other body kept it bottled up in committee. So. today is our chance to get this taken care of. Many of you know that I represent the Second District of Kentucky. which Mr. Natcher served so honorably for 41 years. And over the past 2 years. Ive heard many stories about Mr. Natcher. from Members of Congress to barbers to elevator operators. And they all seem to have one thing in common: an incredible level of respect and admirationon both sides of the aisle. Congressman Natcher was a gentleman in every sense of the word. We all know about his incredible voting streak: When he finally was unable to make it to the Hill. he had not missed a rollcall vote in more than 40 yearsor 18.401 consecutive votes. Cal Ripken could learn something from the gentleman from Bowling Green. KY. And so can we all. My office was recently sent a number of copies of a memorial tribute to Congressman Natcher. It consists of speeches made in this Chamber when he became seriously ill. and after he passed on. as well as various articles about his career. It is an inspiring work. Im honored to be able to send copies of this book to Mr. Natchers family. and to the schools and public libraries of the Second District. There. Mr. Natchers legacy of hard work. fairness. and bipartisanship can continue to touch the lives of young people. Let us pass this final. simple tribute to Congressman Natcher. and ensure that the Natcher Bridge. which will be built primarily with Federal dollars. is known by its proper name here in Washington. DC. and across the country. I thank two colleagues of Mr. NatcherChairman PETR and Chairman SHUSTERfor their quick work on bringing this legislation to the floor.",

Belief. involvement. and commitment. That is what makes a leader. And Bill Natcher had all three. For 40 years. Bill Natcher served in the House of Representatives. For 40 years. he never missed a day of work. For 40 years. he never missed a single vote18.401 votes. Thats commitment. Nine Presidents came and went. He served under seven different Speakers of the House. But Bill Natcher was there day in day out. quietly going about the business of doing the peoples business. He didnt showboat. He didnt make a lot of speeches. He didnt schmooze with the press. He just quietly went about the business of public service. Because he believed in it. And he was never shy about sharing his beliefs. I guess I heard his spiel a thousand times in the 7 years I was in Washington with him. He repeated it virtually every time he spoke before a group of Kentuckians visiting Washington. It wasnt a complex philosophy. He would simply say. and I quote. \"If you educate your children and if you provide for the health of your people. you will continue to live in the strongest Nation in the world.\" Thats it. That was the principle that motivated Bill Natcher for 40 years. He believedhe got involvedand he demonstrated unbelievable commitment. Because of that commitment. he did more than set voting and attendance records that will stand forever. He also made a very big difference in the health. education. and welfare of a whole nation.

The U.S. State Department has found that Irans financial capability to build weapons of mass destruction and to support international terrorism depends on Irans ability to explore for. extract. refine. or transport by pipeline its petroleum resources. In legislation now proceeding through Congress. the President will be required to impose sanctions on foreign companies that invest in Irans oil sector. To some extent. the legislation will stop short of imposing sanctions on foreign entities that finance such investments. However. financing of these projects remains a major concern. I know that your government shares our concern over the threat posed by an Iran armed with nuclear weapons. I would hope that your government would therefore take action to preclude the financing of petroleum development by the financial institutions in your country. The U.S. Congress will be carefully monitoring foreign funding of Irans oil development. Should foreign banks choose to ignore the threat posed by Iran. I have no doubt that the U.S. Congress will revisit this issue and pass legislation that would impose sanctions on foreign institutions that finance petroleum development in Iran.

The President. the Secretary of State. the director of the CIA. have all identified Iran as the worlds leading sponsor of international terrorism.

Terrorism has emerged in the wake of the cold war as the leading threat to democracy and world security. Innocent men. women. and children have been brutally murdered by vicious acts of violence of those who prefer destruction to peace.

We have the opportunity to address this international pathology in the Iran and Libya Oil Sanctions Act. which is aimed at two of the worlds leading sponsors of terrorism. The State Department considers Iran the No. 1 state sponsor of international terrorism. and reports that its terrorist activities are increasing. It is the major financier of some of the most sinister terrorism groups in the world. including Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. Libya is constructing the worlds largest chemical weapons complex. That rogue nation harbors terrorists and refuses. to this day. to hand over those suspected of instigating the terrorism bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie. Scotland. which took 270.innocent lives. including 189 Americans. My home State of New Jersey suffered more lost lives. 37. than any other single State in that deliberate act of horror.

There is no reason the Federal Government should be put at that risk. They are not put at risk for students. veterans or homeowners. so we should not be put at that risk for sugar growers simply because they have the capacity to protect themselves in the legislative arena better than students. homeowners or veterans.",

This ultimately does help family farmers. But it helps family farmers through price stabilitynot a Government check. I think that is the point the Senator from Idaho was making. The reason I asked the question Is that I was making the point that this matters to a lot of family farmers. It matters because if you destroy this program you destroy their price stability. and. frankly. a lot of them will not be farming anymore. But this is not a Government check to those farmers. As the Senator from Idaho properly said. It helps the processors to provide price stability for farmers. which is exactly what makes this a successful program and one that does not cost the taxpayers money. I appreciate very much the Senator yielding.",

    "speech": "This is thi same as the underlying amendment. but It changes the amount that is required of processors to have recourse on from a $10 million threshold to a $15 million threshold. After that. it is a more lenient amendment than the first. If we presume we are requiring people to pay back loans. It does not. I think. aggravate the situation and should not from the standpoint of my colleagues who feel differently on this amendment than I do. I offer it to protect my position in the batting order here. I make one additional point. There was a point made on the other side. and this is. really. ancillary to the overall debate but needs to be responded to. There was a point made on the other side that the Sugar Program as presently structured actually causes a net \"infloat\" of the Treasury because this is an assessment process. However. if you take into effect in the calculation the cost to the Federal Government of having to buy sugar for products which it uses and food stamps and military feeding and child nutrition at the inflated rate we must pay because the Federal Government is a fairly large consumeralso as I mentioned. and I suspect ad nauseam for my colleagues. the price here is dramatically more than the price the market would be were this a marketoriented program versus pricecontrol program. GAO has advised us the cost to the Federal Government. by letter of July 18. the cost in 1994 to the Federal Government for purchasing products which had inflated prices due to the cost of sugar was approximately $90 million annually. So that exceeds. by. I think. a factor of three. what is alleged to be the positive cash flow of this program to the Treasury. Let me read the operative sentences: In 1994. total expenditures on food were approximately 3647 billion. Of this amount. approximately $42 billion was government expenditures for food purchases and cash transfers to consumers for food purchases. This represented 6 5 percent of all domestic food expenditures. Applying this to the $1.4 billion cost of the sugar program. we estimate that the governments additional cost of purchasing food and providing the level of food assistance it delivered in 1994. was approximately $90 million.

I am pleased that the managers of the bill are willing to accept my amendment to correct a problem that has arisen with regard to special research grants section of the Agriculture appropriations bill. Specifically. when the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee requested information from USDA/ CSREES regarding special research grant projects. the Babcock Institute for International Dairy Research and Development at the University of WisconsinMadison. was mistakenly listed as one of the several projects slated for completion at the end of fiscal year 1996. Unfortunately. that information was not accurate. However. this error was not noticed until after the committee had acted on the bill. and funding for the Babcock Institute was omitted from the Committee Report entirely. Therefore. my amendment will simply restore funding for the Babcock Institute in the CSREES special grant section of the bill. The funding provided is $312.000. the same as provided in fiscal year 1996. The importance of the research conducted by the Babcock Institute has never been more important than it is today. The domestic market for many U.S. dairy products will grow less rapidly in the future as the population ages and consumption patterns change. Further. the dairy provisions of the 1996 farm bill also signal the need for dairy farmers to look more toward international markets for their livelihoods. International markets for dairy products are changing in ways that crate opportunities for U.S. dairy farmers. as well as dairy exporters. But along with these developments come many research questions. related to how foreign competitors operate. and the risks associated with export markets. Through its research on many of these topics. the Babcock Institute will continue to play an important role for the U.S. dairy Industry as it seeks to turn its attention more toward international markets. Again. I thank the managers for their support of this amendment. and look forward to working with them to retain funding for this valuable program in conference.",

I must say. with all due respect to my friend from Mississippi. it seems to me that those who are part of this corporate entitlement program that has been culturally ingrained as part of this Federal budget process. we never ask them.

There are benefits that inure to our society. to our economy. and we cannot do that if we continue the old ways. as comfortable as they may have become. So I conclude with the observation that the $70 million is $70 million more than I would like to spend. but this appropriations bill sets a funding level of $90 million. so it does represent a 29 percent increase over the $70 million that would be available under the parameters of the farm bill because we have deleted the money for foreign companies. It seems to me that a spirit of sacrifice and fairness would say. look. those who are the giants of corporate America. they ought to be asked to trim their sails and to cut their spending a bit by enabling us to wean ourselves gradually from this program.

No one wants to return to slavery in this country where someone just tells a human being. \"Look. you do as I say. or else. out the door.\" We have advanced beyond that.

The current situation would require a vote on three separate provisions of the same amendment to a bill that is now pending. the Travel Office reimbursement legislation. We have indicated that that is unacceptable to us. Earlier today. at a press conference. the distinguished majority leader. when asked if he would agree to consideration of three separate bills. answered. \"If we can get an agreement to vote on three separate bills. thats one thing. Ive already given that agreement to have three separate bills.\" As I understand it now. that may not be Senator DOLES exact intent. But I must tell you that if it is. indeed. his position to accept consideration of three separate bills. then. indeed. we would be ready this afternoon to agree. we would allow a vote on the gas tax reduction and relevant amendments. a vote on the minimum wage and amendments that are relevant. and a vote on the TEAM Act with relevant amendments. That seems to me to be exactly what we have been proposing now for several days. If we can do that. we could reach an agreement by 4:45 this afternoon. So I am very hopeful that we are getting closer together. that we can find a way to resolve this impasse. Three separate bills. as the majority leader suggested earlier today. would do that. would give us that opportunity. and I am hopeful that we can talk in good faith and find a way to determine the sequencing and ultimately come to some conclusion on this legislation.

It is Megans law. plus some other additions to help protect our Nations children from sexual predators. The vote was 418 to 0. Known as Megans law. it strengthens the existing law to require all 50 States to notify communities of the prepence of convicted sex offenders who might pose a danger to children. In 1994 the crime bill was lobbied not to require States to take such steps. Since that time. 49 States have enacted sex offender registration laws. and 30 have adopted community notification provisions. but not all States have taken the necessary steps to require such notification. And this is a tragedy in the making. It seems to me that we can prevent this from happening and we can take action now. I do not know any reason to hesitate. So I am going to ask consent when I finish that we bring it up and pass the bill. But every parent in America knows the fear and the doubts he or she suffers worrying about the safety of their children. Parents understand that their children cannot know how truly evil some people are. They know that no matter how hard they try. they cannot be with their children every second of the day. A second is all it takes for tragedy to strike. We have an obligation to ensure that those who committed such crimes will not be able to do so again. This is a limited measure. but an absolutely necessary one.

I want to make sure everyone understands again that the principal form of tax relief that we want to give to families is a $500 credit. child credit. and this is a tax credit. it is not a deduction. so it comes right off that bottom line on your tax return. your ultimate Federal tax liability. calculated after any other deductions. The gentlewoman made a very good point. that the $500perchild tax credit means a $1.000 tax break for a family of four. each and every year until those children become adults. and that is to say until they turn 18. Furthermore. the gentlewoman made an excellent point that with the reduction in interest rates to be brought about by our plan. and let us be clear about one thing and that is that interest rates have been steadily coming down since last. really since last November. and the election of the Republican majority of the Congress. but they have been coming down precipitously in recent weeks with the expectation of the markets that we are going to ultimately reach some sort of agreement regarding a 7year plan to balance the Federal budget. Those interest rate reductions mean. as the gentlewoman so well pointed out. that all Americans will benefit from our balanced budget plan. All Americans will pay less in interest on their home loans. their home mortgages. student loans is another example. car loans. and right down the list. It just basically means that any borrowing will be less expensive. that we will be able to give the American people some immediate tax relief as well as give the economy a real shot in the arm. There is nothing that will stimulate the economy and job creation in the private sector faster. of course. than bringing down interest rates and bringing down taxes. as we also propose to do. for businesses through a reduction in longterm capital gains.",

This will go up every year for the next 7 years. so that by the year 2002 we will spend $290 billion for Medicare. This is an increase by anyones calculations. In the last 7 years. we have spent $926 billion on Medicare. In the next 7 years. we will spend $1.6 trillion. This is at twice the rate of inflation. Just a couple of years ago. President Clinton. in speaking to the country about his health care plan at that time. said anything goes up at twice the rate of inflation is not a cut. E0 1830 Let us look at some other areas.

There is precedent over the past 200 years for the President occasionally doing military exercises. that is. Presidents have sent forces against the Barbary pirates. There have been missions sent out with the various expansions of our country. There are quite a few examples. But it seems to me that there does come a time. and there is a line that needs to be drawn in the definition of what is a police action and what is a very. very significant military action. When we are putting a division of forces on the ground in the middle of a civil war in the Balkans. when we are talking about 37.000 American troops involved. this is not a small operation. I believe it was clearly the intent of the Founding Fathers that in something of this magnitude. it was inherent in the Constitution. which gives Congress the right to declare war. the dominant position in terms of deciding whether we send American men and women overseas into harms way. With that. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished gentleman from California . a Vietnam veteran. somebody who has spoken eloquently on the role of the military. who may desire to also further enlighten us on the relationship between Congress and the Executive. who has been through some of the vigorous discussions related to the War Powers Act and other things. but who also I think can significantly add to this discussion in terms of some of the technical details and what exactly we are getting into.",

In this respect. his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain. but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces as first the general and admiral of the confederacy. while that of the British king extends to declaring war and to raising and regulating fleets and armies. all which by the Constitution under consideration would appertain to the legislature.\" this body. Mr. DORNAN. Further. Abraham Lincoln. in writing to his law partner in 1837. William Herndon. wrote this.

This killing of innocent women and children came amid a series of Bahai executions during the first half of 1983. At the time. President Reagan had expressed Americas alarm at the religious persecution of the Bahais in Iran and had called upon the Iranian leadership to spare the lives of those Bahais condemned to death in Shiraz. The Iranian response to this plea was to carry out without hesitation the schedule of June executions. We know that those men. women. and children were executed not for any crimes but for their religious beliefs. We also know the persecution continues to this day in many forms. both great and small. Thirtynine other Senators have joined with me in sponsoring this legislation. and the Senate today will unanimously adopt an identical resolution already passed by the House of Representatives. By todays action. the U.S. Senate once again will make clear to all who will listen: \"We have not forgotten.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. President. at many times during the past 14 years the Congress has condemned the Government of Iran for its repressive policies and actions toward its Bahal community. Today. I am honored to be celebrating the passage of a resolution which calls on Iran to change its repressive antiBahai policies and to protect the rights of all its people including religious minority groups such as the Bahais. The concurrent resolution we are adopting today is similar to the one which Senator KASSEBAUM. Senator McCAIN. Senator DODD. and I submitted in this body in February. Congress has adopted six previous resolutions on this important issue. The record of their success is certainly a mixed one. at best. Since their enactment. many Bahais have been penalized by the government. and some even sentenced to death. just because of their religious beliefs. On the contrary. previous resolutions have shown some success as well. particularly in the case of one man who had been sentenced to death for his religious convictions. This mans life was saved as the apostasy case was later overturned by the courts in Iran. Although the relationship between the Bahais and the Iranian Government has improved since the first resolution was passed. not enough action has been taken. This open policy of repression is in clear violation of the obligation of sovereign states to uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the past. President Clinton and former Presidents Reagan and Bush have all shown support of the Bahais. The United Nations and many of its member states have also adopted numerous resolutions supporting religious freedom in Iran. Today. in adopting this concurrent resolution. we have succeeded in maintaining vigilance on the actions of Iranian Government. Only through continued support for change in the Iranian regime can over 300.000 Bahais experience true religious freedom.",

From 1992 to 1994. he served as Commissioner of the New York City Police Department. which with 38.000 officers is the worlds largest police force. Over the course of his 32year career with the NYPD. he served in every rank in 25 different commands. In 1993. he was widely praised for his work in investigating the bombing of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. At a recent event in New York. no less a skeptic than Dan Rather called Ray \"the best New York City Police Commissioner since Teddy Roosevelt.\" After leaving the NYPD. Commissioner Kelly served the United States as Director of the International Police Monitors of the Multinational Force in Haiti. He was charged with the difficult and delicate task of putting a stop to human rights abuses by the Haitian police. Upon leaving Haiti in 1995. Mr. Kelly was awarded a commendation by President Clinton for exceptionally meritorious service in Haiti. He was also awarded the Commanders Medal for Public Service by Gen. John Shalikashvili. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Earlier in life. Mr. Kelly served in the U.S. Marine Corps. including combat in Vietnam. He retired with the rank of colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve. He is also an attorney with law degrees from St. Johns University and New York University. He earned his undergraduate degree from Manhattan College and his master of public administration degree from the Kennedy School at Harvard. I know Raymond Kelly as a very smart and very tough law enforcement officer. The Senate has acted wisely to confirm him.

He lived in Douglasville. in the Seventh District of Georgia. where he recently passed away. Born in New York City during the Great Depression. Don grew up in an atmosphere of family devotion. decency. and service. Enlistment in the U.S. Army brought him to combat service in Korea. where after being shot down over enemy territory and wounded. it was discovered he had been underage at enlistment in order to serve his country. Later. he was recruited to hold an important post In counterintelligence with the Army C.I.D. in England. and he continued to give honorable service until his retirement. His absolute and complete memory recall made him one of the best counterintelligence agents of the cold war era. His international and political contacts were legion. and he could always be counted on for encouragement and friendly advice. Perhaps his memory can best be summed up in his own words. He said: Life is a slice of time. brief and brutal. It Is important to know love. to be loved. and to give love. And thats what Its all about. To his country. which he deeply loved. D.

Not only did the President oppose this billat the request of the Washington union bosses who are spending $35 million to run false and misleading campaign ads against Republicansbut his Chief of Staff. Leon Panetta. calls it a poison pill. Why the sudden change of heart? Madam Speaker. my guess is the Presidents army of political hacks and spin gurus suddenly discovered in their polling that American women overwhelmingly support the Republican Working Families Flexibility Act. and they had better do some good ole stump proposals just to cover their electoral bases. While Washington pundits might praise the Presidents ability to hijack important issues for political gain. this kind of gamesmanship only hurts the American people and their ability to balance the conflicting pressures of work and family--especially working women.

But now we have seen an end run around the Congress of the United States with the creative interpretation of a statute and another way to send $40 billion out the back door that Congress would not let go out the front door. Yet again the Federal Reserve is going to meet tomorrow to try and visit another catastrophe on the American people. to raise interest rates. to banish the threat of inflation that does not exist. There is a 30year low in terms of inflation statistics to drive up unemployment. That is the policy of the Federal Reserve. Did this Congress authorize the Federal Reserve to drive up unemployment? Are those the underlying laws and statutes in the United States. and is that the authority which extended to the Federal Reserve: You are charged with driving up unemployment because we do not want to see wages go up. we dont want people to make a better standard of living? That is not what I got elected to do. I believe there are some extraordinary questions here. and they all seem to come back to the same very small influential group. the Federal Reserve. a few people on Wall Street and some people in the administration. some of whom used to work on Wall Street very recently. earning up to $26 million a year advising their company to invest $5.2 billion in Mexico. and now want to bail out Mexico.

Mr. Speaker. the American people are demanding that Congress show leadership in reducing some of its expenses. I constantly speak to constituents who tell me they want to see spending cuts by the Federal Government.

This bill will not eliminate the flexibility in the Legislative Appropriations Act which accommodates each Members particular costs of mailinggeography. population density. etc. If we are calling on Americans to sacrifice then Congress. too. must lead by example.

People are telling us to just send the money to the States and let them spend it. The whole principle of the unfunded mandates bill. which we just passed here on the Senate floor. was that those who raise the money should decide how to spend the money. Governors and mayors were complaining mightily that we in Washington violate this principle. Even as we dealt with the unfunded mandates bill. it was interesting to me that In many jurisdictions they were busy hooking their hose to the Federal tank. siphoning money out of here with bogus plans. such as the provider tax under Medicaid and others. Well. reform works both ways. Responsibility works both ways.

H.R. 1975 would streamline our Federal royalty collection system by improving the management of royalties from Federal and outer continental shelf oil and gas leases. Currently. about $4.2 billion is collected annually by the Federal Government in mineral receiptsour Nations third largest revenue source. However. reform of our Nations royalty collection system has been needed for some time. H.R. 1975 achieves the goals set out by the administration. the States. and industry to provide simplicity and fairness in the partnership between the Federal Government and the leaseholders of Federal lands. Specifically. this legislation would establish a clear statute of limitations on royalty collection. expand existing delegation to States provisions. and set time limits on administrative appeal decisions. This legislation also provides marginal well relief by reforming royalty collections for lowproduction wellsan issue of great importance to my home State of Texas. At a time when we continue to see increasing reliance on oil imports. this legislation provides the necessary relief to enhance domestic production in both an economically efficient and environmentally sound way. In addition. H.R. 1975 would help Congress in its efforts to balance the budget by providing an additional $51 million in royalties over the next 7 years. H.R. 1975 is supported by the administration. a bipartisan delegation of Members from Congress as well as 14 of our Nations Governors who represent most of our Federal onshore production. It is also supported by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and industry trade associations representing our Nations Federal lessees. I urge my colleagues to support royalty simplification and fairness by voting in favor of H.R. 1975.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to H.R. 1975. This illnamed royalty fairness bill is yet another example of corporate welfare for wellheeled oil and gas producers operating on public lands. Just 2 months ago. press reports reveals that 10 oil companies may have underpaid royalties and interest to the Federal Government by as much as $856 million on land in Califomia they lease from the Federal Government to drill for oil. What has the Republicancontrolled Congress proposed in response to this royalty ripoff? First. the Republican majority in the House voted to repeal the gas tax. a move that most economists agree the oil companies will quickly pocket for themselves. Consumers are unlikely to actually see any of this cut reflected in lower prices at the pump. as the Republicans rejected all Democratic efforts to assure the savings would actually be rebated to consumers. And now today. with this bill. we will be providing the big oil and gas companies with yet another windfall. H.R. 1975 will: Result in more than $200 million being paid out to oil and gas companies over the next 20 years by requiring the taxpayers to pay interest payments to oil companies whothrough their own stupidity. mismanagement. or incompetent accounting--have overpaid royalties to the Federal Government. and Establish a 7year statute of limitations that will undermine the Federal Governments ability to collect moneys owed It by huge oil and gas companies. I think Its time we stopped providing Federal freebies to deadbeat drillers. We should defeat this bill. It Is bad energy policy and bad fiscal policy.

The many accomplishments of her too brief tenure as Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service were Indicative of her approach to life. She led the Service at a time when many of our fundamental protections for wildlife and the environment were under attack. But Mollie always seized life by the horns and took the rough ride without complaint. even to the end. She dealt with friend and foe alike with an honesty and straightforwardness that was unusual and refreshing. In fact. I dont believe she regarded those who challenged the conservation policies of her agency as foes. but as people who could see it her way if she just had a chance to talk it over with them. Her vision of wildlife conservation was crystal clear and farreaching. and came not from political calculation. but from moral conviction. The bill we are passing today will rename the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Wilderness. the largest in the refuge system. after Mollie Beattie. The mountains of Alaskas Brooks Range are an appropriate tribute to Mollie. Their quiet beauty should not lead us to underestimate their inner strength.

Mr. Speaker. what I would like to do. with the permission of my colleagues. is go over. one by one. the major issues on this report card. I am going to start with a favorite. and I know the president of the freshman class. my friend. the gentleman from California . Is a businessman voting against an increase in the minimum wage. We have just heard an hour of discussion concerning the merits of raising the minimum wage. During that discussion I did not hear one sentence uttered about the ultimate irony of raising the minimum wage which is putting at risk marginal workers in this country out of work. Every economic study I have ever seen. and. I submit. any economic study folks on the other side of the aisle have seen. holds the same result. When you raise the minimum wage. you automatically put x amount of marginal workers. unskilled. untrained. disabled workers. out of the work force. and that is compassion. That equals compassion. That is the traditional assumption that this majority challenges on this floor every day. I know the gentlewoman from California would like to make a comment about that.",

And you know none of us want to people to stay in a minimum wage job. Mr. Speaker. I would just say my children. Curt and Heidi. worked their way through high school and college with different jobs. They depended on thQse minimum wages. You know. there are very few folks that really wanted to give them more. They were training. they were learning about getting to a job on time. learning what it meant to be there and to follow some of the rules and some of the basics. Many of these minimum wage jobs apply to students across tl Is Nation. both In high school and in college. and many of those students and young people are the very people. the minority students and such. that we are trying to help.",

I do not think that the Federal Government should be involved in the establishment of a minimum wage. No. 1. No. 2. this issue was raised. and the comment about the President illustrates this point as a diversionary tactic. to divert the Nations attention away from the real business at hand in Washington. That is balancing the Federal budget. getting our Federal act in order. learning how we can privatize certain things that government does. learning how we can localize.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when the President of the United States addressed this body last night during his annual remarks on the State of the Union. he expressed his desire to put partisan politics aside and to work with this new Congress in accomplishing the goals of the Nation. We should hasten to accept this challenge. The Presidents message was a forthright affirmation of Americas working men and women. He acknowledges that despite economic recovery. too many families are still working harder for less. President Clinton outlined his strategy for preparing the American people to face the demands of todays economy by raising family incomes. In an effort to reach parity in wages. he proposed raising the minimum wage. He further outlined the proposals of his MiddleClass Bill of Rightsa proposal which will help middleclass families meet the costs of raising and educating their children. obtaining training for higher paying jobs. purchasing a first home. or for the care of an elderly parent. Let us use the Presidents words and ideas as a framework for legislative action. We cannot afford to allow his passionate directives to simply pass through these halls as wishful rhetoric. We must act now. President Clintons new covenant of rights and responsibilities between the Federal Government and the American people is a prescription for new hope. I agree that the Government must help people obtain the necessary tools to improve the quality of their lives. But I further believe that people must play a role in building not only their own lives. but in building and strengthening their communities and their country. To do this. we need to reform our welfare state into a system that rewards work and responsibility. we must continue the fight against crime. and we should build upon the principles of the AmeriCorps national service program. We are a nation of peopleunited to work for many of the same causes. But when we disagree. it does not mean that we are fundamentally different creatures. We simply disagree. Its that simple. For this Nation to move forward. we must learn to agree to disagree and move beyond party lines to work toward the health and well being of all. Thank you.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today Mr. Thomas and I are introducing the Savings and Investment Act of 1995. commonly relerred to as the Super IRA bill. Since I have been a Member of Congress. I have been very concerned about our low national savings rate. I share the belief of chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve that our low national savings rate is our number one economic problem. The savings rate has declined significantly since the 1950s. In 1993. U.S. net national saving was only 2.7 percent of net national product. compared to 12.3 percent in 1950. In a recent study. Professors R. Glenn Hubbard and Jonathan Skinner concluded raising the Individual Retirement Account (IRA) contribution limit would increase net national savings by $4 for every dollar lost in government tax revenue. Professors Hubbard and Skinner believe the decline in the national savings rate is a cause for serious concern because of the links between saving. capital formation. productivity. and American living standards. I believe the purpose of this legislation is to increase our national savings rate. IRAs are a proven tool to boost our savings. Most contributions to IRAs are made by middle income families. All Americans should be able to contribute to IRAs. We need to provide individuals with an incentive to save for their retirement. The U.S. personal saving rate dropped from 5.2 percent of GDP in 19601980 to 3.4 percent in 19911994. Under this legislation. all Americans would be eligible for lully deductible IRAs. Current law only allows those taxpayers who are not covered by any other pension arrangement. and whose income does not exceed $40.000 (S25.000 singles) to be eligible for a fully de-",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for much of the 103d Congress we were occupied with concerns over the Federal budget deficit. we debated numerous and varied ideas to limit spending or raise revenue or accept some combinations of the two. The common goal has been to reduce the deficita deficit that both liberals and conservatives. Republicans and Democrats. see as a threat to our national economic health and longterm stability. We grappled with constitutional amendments to gain a mandatory balanced budget and each appropriation bill seems to bring new attempts to impose generic limits. We saw bills to cut spending across the board. to target programs ranging from the tea tasters to the B1 bomber. all In an effort to get the deficit under control. Through all this. Mr. Speaker. we have not utilized the most effective resource this Nation has to accomplish this critical task. We have not given the American voter a tangible stake In this Countrys financial progress. The National Dividend Plan [NDP]. an idea born in the fifties In the mind and heart of John J. Perry. Jr.. and which I have introduced as H.R. 430. does just that. The NDP doesnt just encourage citizen involvement--involvement is guaranteed through the sharing of the Federal profits of corporate enterprise. This profit sharing is achieved by redirecting revenue collected from the corporate income tax from Federal coffers directly back to those who generated it: The American labor force. This would be done only In years when the budget Is balanced or in surplus. giving all voting citizens a direct stake In the outcome of the Federal budgeting process. John Perry is a successful businessman and philanthropist. He recently wrote of the NDP and I want to share his thoughts with my colleagues.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am very pleased that a consensus is finally emerging in favor of restoring the utility of Individual Retirement Accounts. President Clinton wants them back and so do many Members of this body. As the sponsor of the House super IRA proposal being introduced today and the cosponsor of prior bills. I have long felt we need to give ordinary Americans more reasons to save for their own retirement. The Individual Retirement Account is one of the best savings incentives we have ever developed. The need to expand savings is clear. Americans typically save less than people in other countries and the effect of their habit is clear. A Merrill Lynch survey shows half of American families have less than $1.000 in net financial assets. Even those within 10 years of retirement (ages 55 to 64) only have S6.880 in net financial assets such as checking. savings. IRAs or 401(k) savings. Another survey shows that the 76 million Americans in the Baby Boomer group are saving at rates far below what they need to maintain their standard of living after retirement. When we consider the prospect that Social Security may run out of funds early in the next century. the security of the Baby Boomers looks poor indeed. We need to develop savings incentives that will make them more secure. I strongly support the use of the Individual Retirement Account for that purpose. A 1991 Money Magazine reader survey shows how popular the super IRA truly is with the people we want to serve. 97 percent said they would contribute to IRAs if IRAs were restored. the remaining 3 percent were largely already retired. People made it clear they would contribute new savings to their IRA. IRA popularity cut across all income groups. The Super IRA gives Americans an opportunity to have deductible IRAs or an IRA Plus account in which earnings would be taxfree. The super IRA. with its elimination of the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty for withdrawals for education. medical costs. buying homes. longterm care and times of unemployment. provides a savings vehicle which gives working families the liquidity they want and may need. With both parties now endorsing the IRA as a means of helping middle income Americans. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring the Super IRA.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the States want a workable program with increased State participation. The States have testified in favor of a wetlands program based upon science. The National Academy of Sciences study says that hydrology. vegetation. and soils must all be considered in order to accurately assess what is or is not a wetland. H.R. 961. in contrast. imposes a very simplistic test which considers only one aspect of hydrology. namely surface inundation. and ignores not only vegetation and soils. but also other aspects of hydrology such as soil saturation. Mr. Chairman. the States are not interested in creating huge new loopholes in the wetlands program. they are interested in preserving wetlands resources. and the Boehlert amendment reflects that. The States are not interested in convoluted interpretations of the fifth amendment and similar amendments in State constitutions. and States remain opposed to the takings provisions in the wetlands program in H.R. 961. And the Boehlert amendment reflects that. The States are not interested in expensive and arbitrary wetlands classification schemes. and they have not proposed one. In fact. the State wetlands managers have opposed the classification system of H.R. 961. The States recognize that there are infinitely better ways to evaluate wetlands and use scarce government resources. The recent report of the National Academy of Sciences concludes that it simply is not within the state of the art to do a nationwide prior classification study establishing relative values of wetlands in very different regions. The underlying bill requires exactly what the NAS says is not feasible. The committee has continually been told that this provision or that provision should be supported because it has wide. bipartisan support. Well. the Boehlort amendment has wide. bipartisan support among the Governors and the environmental leaders of our State governments. In fact. the States have indicated that States would not take a greater role in assuming wetlands permitting responsibilities should H.R. 961 become law. And. the two States which have assumed the wetlands program would likely return it. If you are supportive of the wishes of the States. support the Boehlert amendment. If you are supportive of special interests over the needs of the States do not support the amendment.

You cannot farm those fields if you do not have gasoline that you can buy at a reasonable price. We saw the impact a few weeks ago when suddenly gasoline. I noticed out in my area it was $1.39 a gallon. up probably 20 cents. That is just the forerunner of what could happen. That is why fossil energy research is so vitally important to this Nations future.

Mr. Chairman. the $25 million that we are using for these purposes. in other words. deficit reduction and increasing PILT payments to local communities all over America. comes from the fossil energy research and development fund. According to the report of the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution. which passed the House. this is the Republican resolution. let me quote: The Department of Energy has spent billions of dollars on research and development since the oil crisis in 1973 triggered this activity. Returns on this investment have not been cost effective. particularly for applied research and development which industry has ample incentive to undertake. Some of this activity is simply corporate welfare for the oil. gas and utility industries. Much of it duplicates what industry isalready doing. Some has gone to fund technologies in which the market has no interest. That is not BERNIE SANDERS. that is the budget resolution of the Republican majority. Mr. Chairman. this amendment has much to do with honoring our commitment to local communities all over America. including 51 towns in the State of Vermont who are not receiving their fair share of PILT payments from the Federal Government. We have heard a lot of talk in recent years about devolution. about giving responsibility back to local communities. about our respect for local government. If we respect local government. then we should not cheat them. We should provide the type of payments to which they are due. As I mentioned earlier. right now the PILT payments come to about 60 to 70 percent of what has been authorized. We are asking. the gentlewoman from Idaho and I are asking for $25 million. Of that. $15 million goes straight to deficit reduction. 10 million goes back to the local communities Mr. Chairman. I would end simply by saying this. If all of the Members who agree with the philosophy of the gentlewoman from Idaho would support it. all those who agree with my philosophy would support it. and all of those inbetween would support it. we would end up with 435 votes and we would be very happy.

Unfortunately. this amendment is structured to provide a S10 million increase to PILT and S15 million return to the Treasuryall funded out of a reduction in fossil energy research and development. Mr. Chairman. I believe strongly that the $114 million PILT appropriation provided in this bill does not adequately address the needs of our counties. PILT is vitally important to help fund schools. roads. and firefighters in counties with large tracts of Federal lands. In fiscal year 1995. North Dakota received S822.952 for its PILT payments. This amendment would likely increase that amount by about S80.000. However. the minimal increase in PILT does not come close to offsetting the economic impact of the lignite industry in our State. Federal support for fossil energy research is critical to the economy of North Dakota. The funding this amendment targetsfossil fuel research and developmentleads to more efficient use of fossil fuels and benefits all of North Dakotas economy. Whats more this funding is pivotal in finding solutions to environmental problems arising out of the use of these fuels. The Energy and Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks. ND. provides practical solutions to these critical barrier issues. Some of the innovative projects underway at EERC include the control of air toxins. cleanup of mercurycontaminated gas industry sites. cleanup of hydrocarbon contaminated soil and water. emissions control technologies for nearly everything that enters the atmosphere. development of costeffective analytical techniques for waste site cleanup. and the development of costeffective small electric generating units for Native villages in Alaska. The United States. and North Dakota. have an abundance of fossil fuels and will continue to utilize these fuels for our energy needs. The question facing Congress is whether we make the necessary investments to improve our use of these critical fuels. I firmly believe it is incumbent upon this Congress to provide adequate funding for local governments who are adversely affected by the presence of Federal land.

When the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore was created in 1966. Congress adopted a provision requiring the National Park Service to build a new road through the park along the lake. Such a road would destroy hundreds of beautiful acres of forest. fauna. and precious fragile ecosystem while costing taxpayers an estimated $13 million. Since 1966. park visitors have been using Alger County Road H58. which runs through the eastern side of the park and skirts around to the south and west of the park. I have introduced this legislation and this amendment. if you will. to delete the mandate for the Park Service to build a new road through the park. Instead. I would ask that the Park Service be allowed up upgrade the existing county road. H58. which runs through part of the park and currently provides adequate access for all park visitors. This proposal has the support of both local officials and the National Parks and Conservation Association. However. until we can secure passage of this legislation. it is important to prevent the Park Service. from moving forward with plans to build a totally unnecessary road at a cost of S13 million and also harm our environment. Mr. Chairman. I am joined by the gentleman from Michigan who has helped me on this legislation. I regret he is not on the floor at this time.",

Yet. the budget proposal that he has made and the other alternatives that we have before us from the Democratic side of the aisle do not reflect that the era of big government is over. I want to focus on the issue of entitlement changes. because this is where we know we have to make changes if we are ever really going to balance the budget. if we are ever really going to change the direction of government. Many of our entitlement programs are not working the way they should. They are not delivering health care. they are not delivering services to people in poverty the way they should. We need to make changes to that aid we think we can make those changes by giving their management back to the States. back to local governments. Yet the alternative budget provisions and the Clinton budget make none of these changes. No fundamental changes are being made to entitlement programs.

We have a caretaking society. and it has become a caretaking society because of what we have done in the Federal Government. When I was elected from the State government to the Federal government.

It cannot do it better because what it does is. it adds up all the people in a room. adds up their entire shoe size. divides the number of people by the shoe size. and say. \"Here is 8 . wear it.

When President Reagan. in 1981. challenged anyone who did not accept his program to come up with an alternative that offered a greater chance of balancing the budget. the Congressional Black Causus sent him their answer in a month. With that first budget they set the tone for fiscally sound. economically fair. and realistically feasible budgetary options for this country in its attempts to recover from serious economic deficits and high inflation. The Congressional Black Caucus and Progressive Caucus have joined to offer an alternative budget for fiscal year 1997 that does not engage in the economic cannibalism of our Nations poor. elderly. or children. This budget opposes all attempts by the \"elite conservative minority\" of the Republican Party to reduce the value of Social Security. This budget would ensure that current coverage for Medicaid and Medicare is not cut or further compromised. This budget would maintain current services. where the Republican budget would have S240 billion in Medicaid cuts. To encourage commerce through the creation of small and women and minority owned businesses this budget would add another S300 million for each fiscal year. They would freeze Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation moneys at fiscal year 1996 levels rather than allow it to decrease in funding. This budget would oppose any attempts to erode the value of Social Security. including any extension of the age for eligibility. They would balance the budget with a fair application of revenue increases through the elimination of loopholes for multinational and foreign controlled corporations. reform taxation of income of multinational corporations and capital gains reform just to mention a few. Their recommended changes would result in a total of additional revenue of S486.7 billion. The American people need and want a reasoned and balanced plan for addressing this countrys serious deficit problems. and this budget is that plan.",

It may be a matter of degrees on the liberal side of the aisle. but essentially what our friends in the coalition are saying is this: \"We can change the way we spend money. but let us maintain control here in Washington. and let us maintain control.\" they say. \"with the vast Federal bureaucracy.\" Indeed. they use the same mechanisms of the past. Even in trying to have numbers meet in the middle. they have a philosophy which is more of the same: more taxing. more spending. The budget offered by my friends who call themselves Blue Dog would raise taxes $211 billion. The budget offered by the coalition would raise spending S74 billion. And of great concern to the seniors in the Sixth District of Arizona and nationwide. the coalition budget would give seniors $51 billion less over 6 years. The remedy is the same. It is regretable. Our colleagues who call themselves the Blue Dogs seek more of the green stuff from home. They want more of our money in taxes: they want more spending. and they want control here in Washington. Our budget saves our childrens future. empowers people to be selfreliant. and shifts the money. power. and influence out of the hands of the Washington bureaucrats and back home to Main Street. to local government. to solve problems. With that in mind. I urge my colleagues to reject the budget of the Blue Dogs and stay with the new vision for the future.",

I want to quickly respond to my colleague from Arizona and say there are no tax increases in the coalition budget. and that we save or we have 3140 billion more in deficit reduction than the Republican budget. Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to that Republican budget and in strong support of the coalition substitute. The coalition substitute balances the budget in 6 years in an honest. straightforward manner. no detours. no gimmicks. and without any unnecessary tax cuts. The coalitions budget balances our fiscal responsibility with our social responsibility. and the balance is perhaps best illustrated by our Medicare policy. The coalition budget ensures Medicare solvency for the same number of years as the Republican plan. yet without harsh Republican policies. Our Medicare plan is fair to seniors. does not allow managed care companies or doctors to extra bill them. and it only increases premiums for those with the highest incomes. It provides over 32 billion for preventive benefits for cancer screening and diabetes testing. an investment that will make sense and will save both lives and money. Our Medicare plan is also fair to providers. It is supported by numerous health care providers as the most equitable and reasonable way to save the trust fund. Let me read from a letter I received this morning from the American Hospital Association: DEAR REPRESENTATIVE PAYNE: The American Hospital Association. representing 5.000 hospitals. health systems and other providers. believes the Coalitions budget alternative is the best choice available to Congress for balancing the Federal budget. We applaud your efforts and.urge the Congress to adopt your fiscal year 1997 budget plan. The Coalition alternative is compatible with the Medicare and Medicaid budget principles that the American Hospital Association has consistently supported. We appreciate the thoughtful approach the Coalition has taken to deficit reduction. particularly as it pertains to Medicare and Medicald. Signed. Rick Pollack. executive vice president.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this issue of whether or not we should pass the blue dog budget is really a very. very simple matter. When put into perspective. under the blue dog budget the American people would pay S211 billion more in taxes as compared to the Republican plan that we are going to be voting on later on today. Second. the people in Washington. DC. will spend S74 billion more over the next 6 years than under the Republican plan that we will be voting on later on today. So it both taxes the American people more and it spends more. and our people in Wisconsin do not want to pay more taxes and they do not think the people in Washington. DC. need to spend more. But that is not the biggest problem with the blue dog budget. The biggest problem is its impact on the Social Security benefits paid to our senior citizens. And to all of the senior citizens listening here today. I would like to caution them about some Washington jargon that should be a red flag. It is called the CPI adjustment. Whenever anyone hears this Washington language. they need to know that what they are really talking about is reducing the amount of money that is available to be paid to our senior citizens in the future. Let me make this very. very simple. If the blue dog budget passes today. and the CPI. that is the cost of living adjustment. would be 3 percent. under the blue dog plan it would be reduced to 2.5 percent. So instead of going up by 3 percent. an individuals Social Security payments would only go up by 2.5 percent instead. Folks. this needs to be very. very clear. that under the blue dog budget Social Security benefits are impacted. To me. this is a very simple matter. The blue dog budget taxes more. it spends more. and it reduces the amount of money compared to current law that would be paid to our senior citizens from where we are today. Clearly. this is a budget we should be voting against for those three reasons: It taxes more. spends more. and reduces the benefits to our senior citizens.",

I do that as a mother expecting two youngsters soon. and I am especially proud of the coalitions work on a fair balanced budget proposal. One of the biggest selling points. and .. is very clear to everyone. is that the coalition budget has less debt burden placed on our children. my children. everyones children. in the future. The Republican budget will run up S137 billion more in debt. which our children will have to pay: or the S200 billion in the Presidents budget. Regardless of what this extra debt is used for. tax cuts. spending. whatever. it will mean higher interest payments and. therefore. less money for our children. Anyone knows that less money down on a house means a larger payment: more interest that is not even deductible. The coalition alternative balances the budget while being more responsible. The prime example is Medicaid. We maintain guaranteed coverage for those who need it. including disabled children. We allow Medicaid dollars to follow demand. keeping costs down by focusing our dollars on individuals and their needs. We guarantee adequate benefit packages to recipients. Our guarantees of coverage and benefits will be enforceable through the Federal Government. The Republican proposal contains enforcement loopholes. We still give the States the flexibility that they need to create the savings. We retain Federal nursing home standards to protect our elderly citizens. which the Republican plan does not. We do all of this while still slowing the rate of growth in Medicaid. creating a total savings of S70 billion over 6 years in Medicaid. That is what the coalition budget is all about. balancing budget using common sense and fair approaches while doing all that we can to ease the burden on future Americans by taking responsibility for spending now. If we are concerned about the future for our children. which my colleagues over here claim they are. no one can argue that ours is the only budget that leaves the least amount of debt to our children. all of our children.",

I rise in strong opposition to the Lowey amendment. which strikes language in the bill that protects States from being forced to alter their State laws or constitutions to pay for abortions. We defeated this motion last August and I urge defeat of it again today. At least 12 States have been sued by the abortionists because of the adminIstrations twisted interpretations of the 1993 Hyde amendment. which Members should recall allowed but did not require taxpayer funding for abortions in cases of rape and incest. A dozen more States acquiesced rather than face litigation from the abortion industry. The Clinton order has had some disastrous consequences in some States. For example. in Arkansas the people voted and approved a State constitutional amendment endorsed by then Gev. Bill Clinton to prohibit State funding of abortion except to save the life of the mother. A Federal judge. however. has set aside the entire constitutional amendment because in the view of the judge it conflicts with Federal law. thus ordering that State to pay for abortions on demand. I do not think anybody wants to be part of that. having that State being forced to underwrite and subsidize the cost for all abortions. The Clinton order has also invalidated the State laws of Iowa. Minnesota. Pennsylvania. Virginia. Wisconsin. and Wyoming that contained a requirement that rape or incest be reported to a law enforcement agency. I happen to believe that that is a modest request when the death of the baby is being procured. We should be trying to apprehend and hopefully prosecute these people who commit these heinous crimes of rape. rather than let them get off the hook in terms of the reporting requirement. I would hope all States that have any kind of rape or incest would have that kind of requirement. These have been nullified by the Clinton order.",

The Colorado Constitution prohibits the use of public funds for abortions. unless the life of the mother is threatened. Therefore. the State Is put In the position of violating our State constitution or discontinuing the use of Medicaid funds. At a time when we are shifting power back to the States. we should guarantee States the right to place restrictions on the use of Medicaid funds for abortion. This is particularly appropriate In light of the FederalState matching grant nature of Medicaid. The Istook language simply reiterates Congress intent In the Hyde amendment. Colorado Is not the only State that challenges the Clinton administrations Interpretation of the Hyde amendment. The States of Alabama. Arizona. Arkansas. Delaware. Florida. Georgia. Illinois. Indiana. Kansas. Kentucky. Louisiana. Maine. Michigan. Mississippi. Missouri. Montana. Nebraska. Nevada. New Hampshire. New Mexico. North Dakota. Ohio. Oklahoma. Rhode Island. South Carolina. South Dakota. Tennessee. Texas. and Utah also prohibit the use of Medicaid funds for abortion In all cases except when the life of the mother is endangered. The funds involved are taxpayer dollars. and the people of Colorado and other States should determine whether Federal abortion funding restrictions are adequate or need to be strengthened.",

Nobody says a rape victim has an easy matter of it. That is tragic. and it is heartrending. But why visit on the Innocent unborn life execution that the court will not let you do to the rapist? That is a tragedy. and it calls for love and compassion and help. and we ought to provide that. but do not add insult to Injury by executing the most innocent of human beings. an unborn child.

These riders would not allow State to fund abortions via Medicaid In cases of rape and incest.

Policies that force rape and incest victims to continue a resulting pregnancy to term threaten the health of the most vulnerable women. A Medicaideligible woman facing a pregnancy caused by rape and Incest must be permitted to protect her health and to exercise her fundamental right to choose in whatever State she calls home. Under the guise of States rights. the callous and discriminatory effect of the Istook riders will cause additional suffering for women who must already overcome poverty and sexual violence. In States that have funded coverage for abortion under the extreme circumstances of rape or incest. very few abortions have been funded. Women who have been raped often face additional victimization caused by the insensitivity of the police. medical personnel. and the criminal justice system. Now the sponsors of this rider want to allow States to force these women to continue these pregnancies and bear children against the will of the affected women. These riders are another example of legislation that. If considered on its own merits. would not pass muster. We should send a clean CR to the President. not one loaded down with questionable public policy like this. These policy riders are bad public policy.

I was shocked to learn that the Republican budget slashes Medicare by $270 billion. And as if that were not enough. the Republicans slash another $180 billion from Medicaid. In my State of Michigan. close to twothirds of Medicaid is spent on the elderly poor. This is an attack. plain and simple. on Americas senior citizens and on the working parents who are being squeezed between love for their own parents and grandparents. on the one hand. and their children on the other. That is the cruel choice being imposed on the average American by the Republican budget. Sadly. the Republicans are playing \"hide the ball\" with their plans for reforming Medicare and Medicaid. The current legislative schedule allows for only 9 days in September to introduce. review. and vote on the proposed changes. If the Republicans have such wonderful ideas for ensuring the solvency of Medicare. turning Medicaid over to the States. and still protecting the health of our seniors. why are they keeping them a secret? What are they afraid of? It appears that they trying to sneak their radical and extreme cuts past the American public. I can understand why they would be inclined to do so. given the fact that they are also pushing a $245 billion tax cut that primarily benefits the rich. Seniors have a right to know what is In store for Medicare and Medicaid. especially if they are being asked to bear skyrocketing premium3 and limited access to quality care to help finance tax breaks for the wealthy. Working families have a right to know whether the Republicans expect them to bear even more of the costs of caring for their aging parents and grandparents so that the richest few in America can pay lower taxes. At present. the Republican leadership appears content to continue operating In the dark. carefully avoiding the bright light of public scrutiny. I call upon them to deliver a full and open debate on how best to strengthen and improve Medicare. Medicaid. and the countrys public health system. And in the meantime.

Mr. Speaker. 1996 will be a pivotal year for the Census Bureau. as it moves from the planning stage Into the operational mode for the 2000 enumeration. In 1996. the Census Bureau must design the next census. and procure the new technologies to carry it out. Moreover. in 1996. the Census Bureau must evaluate the data gathered this year from three test Census sites around the country. where the Bureau has conducted surveys that will help refine the census process for the nationwide enumeration at the turn of the century.

Its true. the average senior will pay between $2.500 and $3.500 more each year. And senior citizens traditional rights underMedicare to choose their own doctor could also be threatened. Do middleclass families understand what $10 billion in cuts to the Student Loan Program could mean to their efforts to educate their sons and daughters? The Republicans are telling the American people that Medicare is being protected by these cutbacks. But people have to wonder how this can be. when Medicare will be left with barely enough funding to keep up with inflation. There will not be enough money to keep pace with higher medical inflation. or with the cost of new. lifesaving technologies. or with the growth in Medicare population numbers. And that means either benefits will be cut back. or seniors will have to pay more. Do Americans understand where these dramatic cuts to health. education. research. and development are going? The answer is simple: The extra $100 billion is going to subsidize Republican tax breaks for big business and the wealthy. The American people are bound to ask themselves. \"Where were the Republicans in 1993?\"-when not a single one voted for the tough OBRA 1993 plan that both protected Medicares solvency through the end of the decade. and produced nearly onehalf trillion dollars in deficit reduction? That is why it is all the more ironic that today. the Republicans are demanding that we slash the heart out of Medicare. cut $10 billion from the Student Loan Program. cut onethird of Federal funding for nondefense research and development. and keep the National Institutes of Health from expanding its research on womens health. breast cancer. heart disease. and prostate cancer.

Speaker GINGRICH has put before us the version that gives tax breaks to Americas most privileged while socking it to the middle class with deep reductions in the Medicare Program. cuts in student loans and many. many other vital areas. I doubt there are hardworking middleclass families anywhere in this country that will take it harder than those I represent. those working very hard on family farms across North Dakota. Under this plan. funding for agriculture is dangerously. recklessly slashed. According to an analysis of their proposal by North Dakota State University. it projects land values falling 50 percent as farmers can no longer make an adequate income in light of the sharp reductions. Farmers that have farmed their land for generations will be forced off their lands. not just in North Dakota but across rural America. It is not just farmers either that are taking these vicious hits. It is the very warp and fabric of rural America. The Medicare cuts will close rural hospitals. The Medicaid cuts will close nursing homes. Rural development assistance. so vital to diversifying our economies. also due to be slashed. One Republican suburban Member of this body revealed the thinking of the majority as they hit rural America so completely. He says. and I quote: Not everyone needs to be connected to the U.S. Postal Service. If it Is too expensive to deliver to some spot in North Dakota. then those residents can do without it. This budget will take away farms. This budget will take away rural hospitals. This budget will wipe out critical services in rural America. some even advocate eliminating postal service.

But let me promise the authors of this reckless budget. on behalf of the millions of Americans who will be hurt by it. we will be back. This vote is just one step in the budget process. Mr. Speaker. We have a long summer ahead of us. The final details will not be settled until the fall. But every day families are learning that this budget takes food away from their children. Every day college students are organizing. and they will keep fighting until the Republican majority realizes the insanity involved in shutting the classroom door on college kids in order to open up tax loopholes for large profitable corporations. We all know that Americas seniors will not sit quietly this summer while Republicans take away their health security. We have a long way to go before this reckless budget becomes a reality. Mr. Speaker. I promise you that we will be back. I urge my colleagues to oppose this conference report. a report that takes away from children. seniors. and middle income families to give tax breaks to the wealthiest.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I and my colleague. Representative MARKEY. are introducing the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act. which reasserts the rights of employees to take their employers to court for unlawful discrimination. This legislation would prevent employers from requiring employees to check their rights as American citizens at the front door and agree to submit. sometimes unknowingly. to binding mandatory arbitration as a term or condition of hiring. continued employment. or promotion. What started as a practice mainly in the securities industry has now spread to a significant number of Fortune 500 companies. The General Accounting Office estimates that in 5 years. over half of all employees in the United States may be bound by mandatory arbitration contracts. Mandatory arbitration forces employees to choose between their employment and their civil and constitutional rights. such as trial by jury and due process. Employees are forced to submit to arbitration boards that are often set up In a discriminatory fashion. For example. in the securities industry. boards are handpicked by the executives from the industry. who choose from a pool dominated by their peers. They are hardly neutral. Employees also face difficulties in obtaining Injunctions. bringing class action suits. and conducting meaningful pretrial factfinding because employers hold most files and information. My bill would amend seven Federal civil rights and workplace fairness statutes to make it clear that the powers and procedures available under those laws are the exclusive ones that apply to a claim that arises. It does not condemn alternative dispute resolution. it makes it clear that an employee can voluntarily choose to submit a case to arbitration after the claim arises. Since my first introduction of this bill. a number of women have brought stories to my attention about their own dealings with mandatory arbitration. which highlight the need for change. One such case involved a woman who attempted to bring a charge of age discrimination. She had worked at a clerical position with a company for 13 years and was 58 years of age when her job was terminated. She applied for another job within the company for which she was wellqualified. The job method of resolving differences and reducing the courtloads of civil and criminal courts. But the key word is voluntary. No one should be forced to choose between their job and their civil rights. This bill restores integrity to employeeemployer relationships.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as cochair of the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues. I am introducing legislation to institute a Legislative Pay Equity Study. As part of the Economic Equity Act. this bill will be one of a package of bills to promote economic equity for women to be introduced by the Caucus in July. Fifty years have passed since women were found to earn 65 percent of mens wages in 1946. Neither time nor legislation was dramatically improved this inequity: In 1991. women were still found to eam 70 cents for every dollar men eamed. During the nearly five decades that passed between those two studies. many women have moved into traditionally maledominated professions in the work force. Yet their salaries remain significantly lower than those of meneven though women often do the same work as their male counterparts. The Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963 in order to prevent just such discrimination toward women. Calling for equal pay for equal work. this law made it illegal for women to earn less than men for the same labor. Unfortunately. pay inequity persists. One reason is that women often do different work than men. making it possible for employers to pay unequal salaries for theoretically unequal work. Even the 1964 Civil Rights Act. which promised to end discrimination based on gender. race. or ethnicity. failed to bring an end to wage discrimination. It is evident that our laws have not achieved equality in the work force. I am Introducing this bill today in order to end wage discrimination within the legislative branch and to better understand why women remain consistently underpaid in comparison to men. With this information. recommendations could be made as to how workers within the legislative branch could be more equitably paid. This bill Is Identical to the legislation introduced In earlier Congresses by Senator",

I urge my colleagues to join me In congratulating Mr. Bomstein on his incredible accomplishments as president of the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. Mr. Bomstein began dedicating his time and energy to the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in 1957. serving as assistant director. His role changed in later years and he supported the Beth Israel Medical Center as acting executive director. executive director and as a member of the board of trustees. I had the opportunity to work closely with Mr. Bomstein when I was a member of the Newark Municipal Council and when he served on my 10th Congressional District health care task force. Mr. Bomstein is an incredibly skilled man who is dedicated to serving his community. He took Initiative and helped to ensure that the Beth Israel Medical Center remained in the community at a time when many other city hospitals were leaving. I admire this commitment that has always been an integral part of this fine mans persona. As reporter Angela Stewart of The StarLedger noted in her June 21 article. \"Those who have watched him work over the years say Bomstein has managed to strike an almost perfect balance between civility and his driving ambition to make the innercity hospital a respected institution.\" His goal has been and continues to be realized. In 1968. Mr. Bomstein also helped secure a $10 million loan to construct a patient care pavilion. Recently. the Lester M. Bomstein Center for Emergency Services officially opened to patients. It Is clear that Mr. Bomstein has been an important driving force for the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. It is an honor for me to have the opportunity to thank Mr. Bomstein for being a strong leader of the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center and for keeping his promise to the community and the people of Newark.

I have discussed this legislation with my colleagues. Senator CAMPBELL and Senator FEINSTEIN. and feel that this legislation allows for the national recognition of the Presidio while also taking into account concerns about the growing demand for Federal funding for National Park Services. Through this innovative approach to managing one of our Nations finest landmarks. we can ensure the preservation of the Presidio while also providing significant opportunities to the local community. The unique history of the Presidios operation as a military post dates back to 1776. Its designation as a national historic landmark in 1962 recognized the importance of the post in many military operations. After the Army closed the post. the National Park Service took over the Presidio. When comparing our limited resources against the increasing number of national parks and historic sites which have become the responsibility of the Federal Government. it becomes apparent that we must find new ways to manage and preserve such important resources. This legislation proposes a Presidio trust. ensuring the continued preservation of the post with assistance from the local community. This trust. established within the Department of the Interior. would manage the renovation and leasing of specific Presidio properties. The revenues generated from these leases would then offset the cost of maintaining the Presidio as a national park. reducing the need for Federal funding. In my view. this legislation represents the best approach to ensure the efficient management and preservation of the Presidio at the least cost to the taxpayer. The importance of public sector participation in this effort to maintain the Presidio sets this initiative apart from others. and I am pleased to support it.",

In his early career. he never gave much thought to pursuing a career on the bench. one time telling friends. \"I never had a passion to be a judge.\" But he accepted the challenge when. as an assistant attorney general in the Justice Department. President Eisenhower offered him a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Thirteen years later. President Nixon elevated him to the High Court. As Chief Justice for 17 years. Warren Burger lead the Court through a tumultuous period in American historyfirst Vietnam. and later Watergate. The Burger Court could be tough. and the Chief Justices own law and order reputation was well deserved. but Warren Burgers judicial opinions were fair and often reflected his conservative Midwestern upbringing. Fortunately. his legacy did not end with his retirement from the bench in 1986. Warren Burger continued his crusade to educate the public about the Constitution and the courts. And he never forgot his Minnesota roots. Returning home often. he would stop by his alma mater. now called the William Mitchell College of Law. to share his years of knowledge and experience with the students and judges of tomorrow. Mr. President. the Nation has lost a great leader. and Minnesota has lost a great friend. I join my colleagues in expressing our deepest sympathies to the family of Chief Justice Warren Burger.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. before I turn to the provisions of the amendment. I want to make a few comments with respect to what my distinguished colleague from Utah said in his opening remarks on the consideration of this legislation today. It is very important to understand that there are parts of this bill that Members are trying to amend and there are parts we are not trying to amend. There are parts which we think are desirable and worthwhile having. There are other parts that we think are excessive. They overreach. They go too far. Those are the ones we are trying to correct. If we could get it corrected. we would have a total package of which one could be supportive. Examples that are cited. many of them that are being cited. are. in fact. things we are prepared to try to correct with the provisions of this legislation. that we are not opposing. It is very important that that be understood. The New York Times on Friday has an editorial headed \"Protection for Corporate Fraud.\" It says. speaking of the Senate security bill: ... goes far beyond their stated purpose of ending frivolous litigation. The Senate securities bill sets out to protect corporate officials from being sued when they issue overly optimistic predictions of corporate profitability that are simply innocent misjudgment. Sponsors cite cases for opportunist shareholders who waited for a companys share price to nosedive. then sued on the grounds that their investment was based on fraudulent representations of the companys health. But to solve this infrequent problem. the bill would erect a nearly insurmountable barrier to suing officials who peddle recklessly false information. It would block suits against the accountants. lawyers. and other professionals who look the other way when the companies they serve mislead investors. The bill requires that suits be filed within a short statute of limitations and threatens plaintiffs who technically violate the courts procedures with heavy fines. including payment of the defendants legal fees. These provisions would ward off frivolous suits. But they just as surely ward off valid suits. Securities markets work well when investors are confident that the data on which they base decisions is honest. The bill threatens that confidence. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that that editorial be printed at the end of my remarks.",

There has rarely been a Federal program that Congress has not likedWashington. DC. has continually and relentlessly spent the money of American families. and seemingly with no regret.

What that means is that we build for growth in our balanced budget amendment. and we permit those things that help add to an economy. the roads. the bridges. the airports. the water. the sewer systems. the buildings. Those things that are necessary for growth can be accounted for and reflected and encouraged. not discouraged. Mr. Chairman.

Yes. it is a great bumper sticker. threefifths vote to raise taxes. 60 percent vote instead of a 50percent vote. 60 percent. a supermajority. instead of a regular majority. Where does this stop. Mr. Chairman? Should we have a 60percent majority. for instance. to change Social Security? Perhaps so. Should there be a 60percent majority required before a prograrm can be cut. whether it is welfare or defense or something along those lines? Should there be a 60percent majority for just about anything that we feel is important? I guess what is most concerning to me. Mr. Chairman. on this Is that where does the 60percent majority stop and what are the priorities? I get concerned when somebody tells me they want a 60percent majority in the Constitution to take money from a mother and father. Laudable. yes. However. I am equally concerned. or more concerned. when I know that the toughest vote I will ever cast is whether or not to go to war. and yet It is only a 50percent majority to take the son or daughter from the mother or father to send them to war. Certainly. Mr. Chairman. majority rule is what has governed this country. Majority rule is what should continue. For those reasons. I oppose the Barton substitute.",

Mr. Chairman. Congress is not known for resisting such pressure. We need a safeguard to make it tougher to raise taxes than to cut spending. We need a twothirds supermajority of 60 percent on proposals to raise taxes. Mr. Chairman. in Oklahoma. continuous tax increases prompted the people to pass a restriction. Oklahoma now requires that to raise taxes there must be a 75percent supermargin in the legislature or a statewide vote approving it. It worked. Taxes in Oklahoma have stopped going up.

At this point in the history of the United States. more than 10.000 amendments have been offered to the Constitution of the United States in more than 208 years. Of those 10.000. only 27 have been enacted. Mr. Chairman. it is clear to me that as a result of the change of the structure of the House and the makeup of the House today on both the majority side and the minority side. that there will likely be a twothirds majority of this House for some form of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Mr. Chairman. I fear the destruction of the Constitution. and I think that. as we learned from Prohibition in the 1920s. we may realize that what we think is a good solution and a fast solution to inject intestinal fortitude into this Congress and into this Government. that we may instead wreck havoc on the Constitution. I think particularly the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas requiring a threefifths majority to either raise taxes or to run a deficit is particularly egregious. It indicates the lengths to which we are going to put into place an amendment to our sacred Constitution. The Barton amendment is an irresponsible proposal that must be rejected.

Like so many other issues we deal with. the considerations are not black or white but. In the words of Bill Joel. \"shades of gray. \" On balance. I vote yes because I believe the tough choices to reduce our $5 trillion debt will not be made without the constitutional requirement to balance receipts and outlays. So I will support the StenholmSchaefer amendment as I did in the last Congress. But I will also support for the first time the BartonTauzinGeren amendment to raise the threshold for raising taxes to a supermajority of 60 percent. Constitutional amendments are different from laws or House rules for reasons carefully cited in this debate. But having watched Congress frequent inability to rein in spending and to face tough choices. I feel that to be effective the amendment must put maximum pressure on us to reduce spending first and that is what raising the tax threshold will do. A related and critical issue is the treatment of Social Security in any budget balancing process. Valid issues about fairness and viability of our Social Security system need to be addressed at a future time. but the Social Security trust fund which is funded by a 15percent annual flat tax on Americas workers must be protected. I support the Wise amendment because it takes Social Security offbudget and support House Concurrent Resolution 17. Let me add two final thoughts. First. by taking clear action today the House is standing up to its responsibility to start the debate. No doubt what we finally do will be further amplified in the Senate. in conference. and in our statehouses. Everyone must participate in the national debate on the best form of the balanced budget amendment. and the blueprint to achieve a balanced budget.

Any time we find an issue we do not have the courage to deal with ourselves we are going to put forth a super majority so that everybody can deal with it that way and then throw it off to someone else?

This whole issue of Social Security that some people think we are trying to scare some folks here. this is an honest issue. This is a truthful issue. Why will people not tell us what is going to happen to Social Security and Medicare once this constitutional amendment takes effect?

Now the agency says--and this is my hypotheticalthe agency costbenefit analysis says. for 100 million bucks. you are going to save 1.000 lives. If you want to spend $110 million. you are going to save 2.000 lives.",

The point is. will you allow the agency. using that costbenefit analysis. to go to the $110 million instead of $100 million. even though the $100 million may meet the minimum threshold. since there is a range allowed by definition. or else you would not be doing the costbenefit analysis? You would not need to. It would not be as relevant as it otherwise should be. You are doing a costbenefit analysis most of the time because a range is permitted. and if a range is permitted under the statute. the question is then. will you allow the agency discretion to implement something more expensive than the least costly. if you can. for a small incremental amount to significantly increase the benefit? I think the intention of the sponsors is to allow the agency to do so. However. we have pointed out over and over again that the language of the bill does not permit the agency to do it. because it says that unless the benefit is nonquantifiablenonquantifiableyou cannot go to anything but the least costly.",

    "speech": "I thank the distinguished Senator. Mr. President. as I was saying. I want to return to a second point about regulatory reform. Effective regulatory reform cannot be prospective only. It must look back to reform old rules already on the books. and the DoleJohnston compromise contains a balanced. workable and fair resolution of how agencies should review existing rules. Agencies may select for themselves any particular rules that they think need reexamination. while allowing interested parties to petition the agency to add an overlooked rule. To ensure that only a limited number of petitions will be filed. S. 343 limits petitions to major rules and sets a high burden of proof. Petitioners must show a substantial likelihood that the rule could not satisfy the costbenefit decisional criteria of section 624. This is an efficient and workable method to review problematic rules. The Glenn substitute. on the other hand. makes the review of agency rules a voluntary undertaking. There are no firm requirements for action. no set rules to be reviewed. no binding standard. no meaningful deadline. The Glenn substitute simply asks that every 5 years. the agency issue a schedule of rules that each agency. in its sole discretion. thinks merits review. It does not require any particular number of rules to be reviewed. and if someone asks the agency to review a particular rule. there is no Judicial review of a decision declining to place the rule on the schedule. Moreover. there is no judicial review of any of the deadlines for completing the review of any rules.",

    "speech": "I rise to express serious reservations about S. 343. the regulatory reform bill. After listening to over a weeks debate. I remain doubtful that a vote in favor of S. 343 would serve the best interests of the American people. While I support carefully crafted regulatory reform efforts like the GlennChafee substitute. S. 343 does not meet my standards nor the standards of the people of New Jersey. I doubt whether my constituents want new red tape requirements which would delay longawaited regulations for food safety. drinking water quality. worker protections and pollution control. Even with the changes adopted during the last week. S. 343 is still a prescription for delay. duplication. and judicial gridlock. S. 343 is not true reform. It is full of exemptions and special interest provisions unrelated to the basic bill or which give assistance to particular industries. Its provisions will swamp agencies with requirements for hundreds of new. costly. and timeconsuming analyses and it will undermine needed health. safety and environmental regulations already on the books. S. 343 is filled with new opportunities for endless rounds of judicial review. Yesterday. our colleague Senator JOHN KERRY stated that the bill still contained 88 new places for court intervention in the regulatory process. despite the efforts of many Senators to improve this aspect of S. 343. S. 343 could result in the sunset of many regulations if agencies failed to review them accordingly to required time schedules. Even worse. the schedules themselves might be manipulated by special interests who could overload agency review agendas and tie them up until regulations expired. Finally. S. 343 still includes language which favors the least cost and not the most costeffective regulationsan affront to common sense which could result in missed opportunities for sensible regulatory revisions. Mr. President. this country needs regulatory reform. Regulated businesses and individuals deserve the most flexible. costeffective regulations agencies can craft while still providing the protections Congress has provided and all of us need. But it is also time for us to admit the real cause of many regulatory complaintsoverly prescriptive and sloppily drafted legislation. While this bill needs further work. I hope we can resume negotiations and produce a regulatory reform bill we all can support.",

Now I understand that Members of the new minority are taking their own fledgling steps toward coming up with a plan. and I welcome what in essence. according to one newspaper account. amounts to a. quote unquote. deathbed conversion after months of railing and ranting when we were willing to abandon politics as usual and say no. It is always better for a professional politician to try and explain away problems. No. we rather not confront this. the fact that we have come from different walks of life to serve here as citizen legislators and say to the American public this is an issue too important to play politics as usual. and so I think even though we had months and months of reticence. to put it diplomatically. from our friends from the new minority. now even they are understanding that the American people are not going to be satisfied with people sitting on the sidelines moaning. complaining. about very serious policy questions. So to their credit in fairness I am glad to see that many Members of the minority now say that they want to come up with a plan. However. it is important to remember this. Is it a fledgling step for political appearances that amounts to putting a BandAid across a very serious wound? The fact is we have to take on this problem and solve it. and it is not time for a BandAid solution to get us through 2 years to an election. No. when we take the oath of office here. we are here to act first as legislators. not ignoring the political dimension. but to act.",

That is what our goal is. One of the big tragedies. when we talk about cuts. is that what we are trying to do is slow down the inflation rate. Medicare inflation last year was 11 percent. Regular health care inflation. as the gentleman from Michigan . pointed out. was actually about 1 percent. What we are trying to do is get Medicare down in the 4 to 6 percent range. and if we can just slow down the growth to that degree. we will be increasing the benefits of the people S4.800 to $6.700. as the gentleman pointed out. and we will have more options for our seniors.",

We did this long before. so there is no \"if\" then to this procedure.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. The Contract With America Advancement Act: what a true abuse of the English language. If this is an advancement of the Contract With America. the one thing it demonstrates is that some of our Republican colleagues cannot tell backward from forward. Let us look at what is included in this great advancement of the Contract With America failed agenda. Well. the first thing is an increase in the Social Security earnings limit. A laudable measure. So laudable that 411 Members of this body last year voted to approve it. and only four voted against it. Our seniors would have this Social Security earnings limit adjusted already if our Republican colleagues had advanced it at the beginning of this Congress instead of at this point. What is the second item? Regulatory reform. Far different from the regulatory wreckage of the unilateral disarmament of our health and safety laws that they proposed last year. Again. if they had advanced this very modest regulatory reform. our small businesses across America would have had relief in 1995. not a promise in 1996. Finally and most important. it advances the contract through the lineitem veto. What is the history of the lineitem veto in this body? Well. last February we took it up. and we considered it. and we approved it by a vote of 294 to 134. It is true that the version that is here before us today is improved. improved In part because at the time of that debate in February. my Republican colleagues rejected the sunset amendment that I proposed. and today they have incorporated that very amendment into this proposal. The Speaker of the House came to the floor that night and he told us. and I quote: \"You have a Republican majority giving to a Democratic President this year without any gimmoks an increased power over spending. which we think is important.\" Unfortunately. he did not think it was important enough to appoint conferees for 6 months. or the President would have had this tool last year. What we have here is a Contract With America that is a flop. and this advancement act is a sop.",

I met a woman in my district the other day. a single mother with 2 minimum wage jobs. She told me she was worried that her kids would not be a victim of a crime. she was worried they would perpetrate crimes. People cannot spend time with their family if they do not earn a decent wage.

This bill does a good job of taking care of the pork barrel spending. but it does a lousy job of taking care of special interest tax breaks. Why is that? It is because the people on the Republican side of the aisle like special interest tax breaks. We hear on the floor day after day proponents of tax reform from the Republican side say. \"Lets have a flat tax. Lets get rid of all these deductions. Lets get rid of all these loopholes.\" Well. this was the opportunity to get rid of those. This bill was the opportunity to say we do not believe in special interest tax loopholes. But when they came up to bat. they swung and missed. They had no desire to give the President of the United States the ability to get rid of special interest tax loopholes. Why not? Because they are the gift that just keeps on giving. You can tuck them away into a revenue bill. You do not have to go through the appropriations process. It just keeps giving and giving and giving.

I must say that if there was a way that the Chamber could limit or eliminate the opportunity to filibuster on the motion to proceed I would certainly consider that to be a step forwardto put it in a more clear way. if I may. a step toward diminishing the misuse of the power of the filibuster. But it does seem to me that the problem here has arisen most frequently on the motion to proceed but the problem remains the filibuster which is the ability in this Senators opinion of a minority to frustrate the will of 51 Members of this Senate to represent their constituents and get something done. It has arisen most frequently on the motion to proceed because that is the first time it could arise. My friend and colleague from Iowa has talked about the six occasions in which in the consideration of a typical matter here in the Senate a filibuster could occur. In fact. if one considered amendments and the opportunity to filibuster amendments. there are even more than six. But let us talk about the six. It is as if there were six hurdles or six obstacles on the passage of a measure. And it is true that the first hurdle is the motion to proceed. So the filibuster has arisen most often on that because it is the first hurdle. If we eliminated that hurdle. I would say that would be a step toward eliminating or diminishing the misuse.

So the majority leader says: We will get around HARKIN. we will bring it up under rule VIII. There is nothing I can do about it. It is nondebatable. But what is to prevent me from saying when the bill comes up we will filibuster it now?",

While our colleagues on the other side of the aisle ultimately succeeded in passing the bill. Republicans argued thenand continue to maintainthat the bill spent far too much on social programs of unproven worth. while failing to adopt some of the tough measures proposed to combat violent crime. To a large degree. S. 3 attempts to correct some of the obvious flaws and excesses of last years crime bill. It also stakes out some critical new ground. particularly in the area of criminal procedure. More importantly. S. 3 is premised on the principle that criminals are not the victims of society. as some may claim. but rather that society itself is the victim of criminals and the violence they perpetuate. In addition. S. 3 recognizes that the States and localities. not the Federal Government. are on the front lines in the war against crime and are best equipped to devise effective anticrime strategies. When it comes to fighting crime. the role of the Federal Government should be to assist the States and localities in their own crimefighting efforts. rather than impose unnecessary regulations and \"onesizefitsall\" requirements that often do more harm than good.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation designed to give President Clinton the same tool to control spending that 41 Governors now enjoy. I am talking about the lineitem veto. Republicans have supported giving the President the lineitem veto for years. During the 1980s. opponents of the lineitem veto used to say that Republicans supported it only because the President happened to be a Republican at that time. By introducing this bill as Senate bill No. 4. and making adoption of a legislative lineitem veto a top priority for the 104th Congress. we hope to dispel that myth once and for all. We believe that any President of the United States. as Chief Executive. should be given more power over Federal spending. This legislation would give the President the authority to rescind any combination of line items in an appropriations bill. The Presidents rescission proposal would take effect until a twothirds majority in both Houses of Congress votes to overturn the Presidents decision. Mr. President. several of our colleagues have worked long and hard on this issue. The distinguished Senator from Indiana [Senator COATS) and the distinguished Senator from Arizona [Senator MCCAIN] have worked tirelessly in support of this legislation for years. Each time the Senate has voted on the lineitem veto. we have been able to garner a few more votes. This may well be the year that we finally get the job done.

Senator DoMENICI. has agreed to schedule a committee hearing and a markup on lineitem veto legislation later this month. My hope is that working with the members of that committeeDemocrat and RepublicanChairman DOMENICI will be able to get legislation adopted in committee and to the Senator floor that can serve as the blueprint for lineitem veto legislation that can be approved by the full Senate. adopted in both Houses of Congress. and signed into law by the President this year.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join Majority Leader DOLE. Senator COATS. and many others in introducing the Legislative LineItem Veto of 1995. Mr. President. this is the same bill that I have sponsored for the last 8 years. However. I would like to describe the bill again at this time. The bill would do: (1) It gives the President the power to identify. up to 20 days after an appropriations bill is sent to the President for his signature. items of spending within that bill that are wasteful. and to notify Congress that the President is eliminating or reducing the funds for those items. (2) The President may vetoor in other words freezepart or all of the funds for programs deemed wasteful. (3) Such items are called enhanced rescissions or more commonly referred to as lineitem vetoes. (4) The Congress is required to overturn these lineitem vetoes with simply majority votes in the House and Senate within 20 days or they automatically become effective. (5) If the Congress disagrees with the President. it may pass a rescission disapproval bill. (6) The President then has the opportunity to veto the rescission disapproval bill. In that case. the veto may be overridden by a twothirds vote of the House and Senate. (7) This bill would also allow the President a second chance to eliminate wasteful porkbarrel spending by allowing him to submit such enhanced rescissions with the budget submission at the beginning of the year. This second shot at proposing rescission ensures that the President has the opportunity to strike at porkbarrel spending that may not be obvious during the first rescission period. Mr. President. this bill would not: allow the President to rescind money for entitlement like Social Security. Medicaid. or food stamps. The bill amends part B of title X of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. It does not amend part A of title X of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The language from part A of title X is retained. It specifies that: Nothing contained in this Act. or in any amendment made by this Act. shall be construed as * * * superseding any provision of law which requires the obligation of budget appropriation or the making of outlays thereunder.\" This language from part A of title X ensures that the President cannot rescind funds for entitlement.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise as the sponsor of S. 11. the \"Medical Care Injury Compensation Act of 1995.\" As the 104th Congress begins to consider targeted. market based health care reform options. we should remember that medical malpractice costs are an integral component of the high cost of medical care and health insurance. The current medical malpractice system encourages litigation and exorbitant outofcourt settlements. According to a LewinVHI study. direct liability costs have been growing at four times the rate of inflation. Defensive medicine is projected to add as much as $76 billion annually to national health care costs by the year 2000. Doctors fear is reasonable when viewed in light of a study done by the Institute of Medicine which found that 40% of all doctors and 70% of all obstetriciangynecologists will be sued during their careers. Mr. President. medical liability costs do not result in the productive use of our national health care dollars. According to a study by the Hudson Institute. of the billions spent annually on medical liability costs. 57 cents out of each dollar goes to lawyers rather than injured patients. This study concluded that medical liability costs added $450 in direct and indirect costs to each hospital admission. Nationally. this represents more than 5% of the average hospitals operating expenses. In an effort to address this problem through sensible targeted reform. I have introduced S. 11. This legislation caps noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering at $250.000. imposes a limit on attorneys fees of 25% of the first $150.000 recovered and 15% of any amount in excess of $150.000. provides for periodic payments where damages for future economic loss exceed $100.000. provides for mandatory offsets for damages paid by a \"collateral source.\" and reforms \"joint and several\" liability. S. 11 also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to the states for the implementation and evaluation of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) systems. Mr. President. I believe S. 11 offers an important legislative mechanism for controlling national health care expenditures. I hope may colleagues will join me in support S. 11. By Mr. ROTH (for himself. Mr. BREAUX.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to support the Private Property Rights Act of 1995a bill similar to the private property rights legislation Senator DOLE and I introduced during the 103d Congress. This bill recognizes the important role the use anti ownership of property plays in American society and declares the policy of the Federal Government to be one that will minimize takings of private property. The fifth amendment to the Constitution clearly provides that private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation. As such. the DoleHeflin bill creates a method whereby the impact on private property rights is duly considered in Federal regulatory activities. Specifically. the bill will require Federal agencies to certify to the Attorney General that a taking impact assessment has been completed prior to promulgating any agency policy. The takings impact assessment must consider the effect of the agency action. the cost of the action to the Federal Government. the reduction in value to private property owners. anci requires the agency to consider alternatives to taking private property. In effect. compliance with this act will not only help avoid inadvertent takings of constitutionally guaranteed rights but will also reduce the Federal Governments financial liability for such compensable takings. In closing. I believe that private property rights are the foundation of the individual liberties we all enjoy as Americans. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. By Mr. HELMS:",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the BoehlertBarrett conservation amendment. It contains the backbone of a comprehensive conservation title that should be in the final version of the farm bill whenever that might come about. I am pleased that the authority for new enrollments in the Conservation Reserve Program is included. The CRP is of great Importance in my State of South Dakota for several reasons. for its impact on cutting soil erosion. Increasing water quality and enhancing habitat for wildlife. We have seen pheasant populations in South Dakota head back toward historical. record levels. The same is true of duck populations. which have increased by 30 percent. and songbird populations. Many of the songbirds documented on CRP acreage were previously headed toward decline and facing the possibility of being threatened under the Endangered Species Act. I am also pleased that the gentleman from Nebraska worked with agricultural interests and wildlife groups to come up with a compromise on the issue of early outs. The other component of this amendment is the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. I have been working with Chairman ALLARD on a similar provision in the Agriculture Committee. This program will be vital in ensuring the viability of livestock operations throughout the country. The livestock sector is facing devastating swings in market prices and the technical assistance and costshare funds provided by EQIP may help keep many family operations from going out of business. I want to commend the livestock and commodity groups in their initiative in working to meet the environmental concerns facing their industry. They want to take an active role in ensuring their operations do not degradate the land they live on or the water their families drink. As I indicated. this is a start toward a conservation title that can balance the survival of family farms with protection of their land and resources for generations to come. I look forward to working with Chairmen ROBERTS and ALLARD to address the remaining important issues such as commonsense reforms to the Swampbuster provision that they included in H.R. 2973.",

If you add the CRP contracts to expire next year. we are talking about 24 million acres of land.

It has a wide spectrum of interests. and farmers and environmentalists and sportsmen and the public sector. frankly. get large benefits from the program. and the House should not dismiss our responsibility to reauthorize the program.

I have already made the point that we are scoring big points in getting discretionary spending under control. What the proponents of this amendment and the later subsequent provision In the agriculture bill do to create the LEAP Program on Leap Day of Leap Year of 1996 is to create a $1.4 billion mandatory program. Now. there has been some discussion that. well. it is not really a mandatory entitlement. I would only point to the bill itself. in fact to the provision. I think this is the Boehlert amendment. \"Title III. Conservation. section 1241. mandatory expenses.\" The whole program Is listed under mandatory expenses. It says the \"Environmental Quality Incentive Program for each of fiscal years 1996 through 2002. 3200 million of funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be available.\" It does not say \"may be available\" or \"may be appropriated\" or \"might be spent.\" It says \"it shall be available.\" which means this indeed is a mandatory program. It increases spending. Now. I have to tell my Republican colleagues. I got this report from the House Republican conference talking points on why you should support the House bill and not support the Senate bill. Well. on the second page. it says the Senate bill is \"chock full of new spending.\" That is the reason you should not vote for the Senate bill. Well. what are we doing here? Creating a nondiscretionary. mandatory new entitlement for $1.4 billion. Do not come to the Committee on Appropriations and say \"We need to cut spending\" if you vote for this. This Is locked in spending. Nobody can cut It. nobody can adjust it. you just have to spend the money. And when you go back to the campaign trail and say \"We have got to do something about the mandatory side of the equation. twothirds of the Federal budget. twothirds of $1.6 billion that we spend every year. but we cant do it because we cant get the votes. cant get the support.\" if you vote for this. you will know why.

If we are dealing with the area of agriculture. how do we save money? We reduce soil erosion. we prevent ground water from becoming contaminated. we reduce the necessity of spending Federal dollars on flooding. How do you do all these things in one particular area in the scheme of things? If we are dealing with agriculture. we need to spend taxpayer money wisely. we need to spend Federal dollars wisely. to reduce the overall mismanagement of things. So if we can have conservation programs that protect things such as wetlands. which. by the way. are now relatively easily identified and farmers wanted to participate in that so they can encourage the fact that soil will not be eroded anymore. ground water will be clean. we will have areas that will not be flooded anymore. we have areas where fish can spawn. and they want to participate in the best management practices for farming. then we are going to work as a team.

Now. it is nice that we come to the floor and debate this Issue about the LEAP program on leap day of leap year. 1996. That is interesting. That is coincidental. But the real fact is. are we just pulling the wool over the American peoples eyes when we talk about a balanced budget? I suggest to Members. that they look at the trend that we have created with discretionary spending. and remember. discretionary spending is only onethird of the equation. onethird of the budget of the United States that we spend every year. But we are working on nondefense discretionary. we are getting the sum down. We are serious about trying to save the taxpayers money. As we all know. however. that other twothirds is growing. Without a budget agreement. we will not get a handle on it. The last thing we need to do is make the problem worse. The last thing we need to do is create new entitlements. The last thing we need to do is make those entitlements lock in good programs. wellintentioned programs. wellmeaning programs. so we cannot ever adjust them. We cannot touch them. But if you vote for this amendment. If you vote against my provision. in fact. you do not want to balance the budget by the year 2002. Perhaps you mean 3002.",

The election of November 8. 1994. sent a clear. unequivocal message to the Congress of the United States. The American people want smaller. less costly. less intrusive. yet more efficient government. They want us to get our priorities in order. And guess what. they did not send us here to dismantle a quarter of a century of progress in important. sensitive. environmental legislation. Who are the principal stewards of our land? Our farmers. agriculture. This is our greatest opportunity to do something meaningful to protect our environment. When we want to talk about water quality. are Members not all concerned. as we all should be. when in one of the premier cities of America. Milwaukee. in December 1993. 104 people died because they drank the water from a public water system? That is a cause for concern.

Such clean up and pollution prevention should be borne by those responsible for the contamination. the producers In agribusiness. Furthermore. the limitations on the acreage Included in the CRP and the WRP proposal will sharply limit their effectiveness. I am hopeful that there is not an implication In the purchase of easements. a concept. that the Federal Government must pay land owners so that they will not pollute or damage the environment.

Both governmental and societal repression and discrimination against ethnic Armenians continue in Azerbaijan. The 18.000 ethnic Armenian and partArmenians. most of them members of mixed families. continue to live in an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. There are credible reports of denial of medical treatment to ethnic Armenians. confiscation of their travel and resident documents. and most of those Armenians who lost Jobs in previous years are still unemployed.

If there is a people in the world that has suffered. there are not many that have suffered more than the Armenians. When Hitler proposed his extermination of the Jews. there was some opposition in the room. He silenced his opposition by asking the question. who remembers the Armenians? We are here today in a very simple situation. in essence. If we wanted to provide assistance elsewhere. if we wanted to find a way to help the others here. they simply need to end their blockade. The Armenians have suffered from nature and from their neighbors. Half a million people were left homeless in 1988. The blockade prevents the rebuilding of those homes and prevents assistance to some 300.000 refugees. I go back to what I said earlier about Saddam Hussein. At every opportunity Saddam Hussein brings up the orphans of the war and their plight. The plight of the Iraqis is not the result of what the United States and other countries did. It is the result of what Saddam Hussein did. The same is here. Azerbaijan needs only to lift the embargo to have this entire House embrace and assist its people. This is not a vengeful Congress that will complain for decades about previous actions even by this very government that exists there today. End the blockade against Armenia. and you will not find Members of this House on either side of the aisle arguing for continued resistance to support any economic needs that we can provide for AzerbaiJan. The Armenians have suffered enough in history. The request is small enough. End the blockade and you will not see a Visclosky amendment.",

Three years ago this Congress took an important stand. both because of an historic obligation to the Armenian people. for certainly the world owed them some recognition of their suffering. but also because of a barbaric blockade. The situation in Azerbaijan and Armenia is not the same. Eightyfive percent of all products going to Armenia must flow through Azerbaijan. Ninetyfive percent of people now of Armenia are living on under $1 a day. It is not a sustainable situation. This country is in a test of wills with Azerbaijan. We have said clearly. lift this blockade. allow the worlds assistance to get to the Armenian people. or we will not be there for you. Now at this late date. 3 years into this struggle. for us to lift this sanction would send a message that would be seen around the world. and certainly this blockade then would never ever be lifted. Azerbaijan has spoken in this test of wills. They have done nothing. nothing has been lifted. I am sensitive to the comments of the distinguished chairman of the committee that certainly we do not wanted refugees to suffer. But when the Congress enacted this provision. we spoke to that need. Under section 907. refugees are exempted to ensure that as we are in a test with the Azerbaijani Government. refugees themselves do not suffer. I ask members of the committee to stand with what has been a proud 3year provision of American law. The obligation is not on the United States. It is on the Azerbaijani Government. Now at this late date in history. after so many years. the Armenian people fought for their own homeland. after so many years their struggles and their sufferings were ignored. not at this late date to turn our backs on them once again.",

I believe that the rationale behind the policy that is on the books today is as strong as it was in 1992 when it was adopted. I believe that those who have tried to establish an equivalence or a parity between Armenia and Azerbaijan are Just mistaken. There is only one of those two nations that is imposing a blockade. There is only one of those two nations that is a victim of a blockade. And the theory behind the Freedom Support Act and the theory behind the Humanitarian Aid Corridors Act is that a country which imposes a blockade on another country should not be provided aid. This blockade does exist. There is no disputing that. In fact. it is referred to on page 34 of the report of the Committee on Appropriations. It is referred to as causing dire effects on the Armenians. It is causing untold human suffering and damage to their economy. It should be our business to try to lift that blockade as we have made it our business to lift any blockade that is barring humanitarian aid to another nation. There is another aspect of this amendment that I have to bring to light. and I believe that this amendment is as important for the integrity of the legislative process and the reputation of this Congress as it is for the benefit of the people of Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh. I am referring to the millions of dollars that have been spent in lobbying efforts by the Government of Azerbaijan. spent to hire a former Member of this House. who is a convicted felon. who has served time in prison. who in turn has hired other exMembers of this House to lobby for Azerbaijan. I believe this is an example of the revolving door at its worst. It is whywe need reform in the rules that specify when our former colleagues should be allowed to lobby us. I believe that on the merits. on the substance. we must support this amendment. I believe as a matter of retaining the integrity of our own process and our own reputation. we must approve this amendment.

Of course. the reference there is Nagorno Karabagh. Nagorno Karabagh is an Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan. The reason why there are Armenians there is because they have been there historically for years. They were involved in the act of selfdefense to protect their own homes and their own lands. So naturally there are going to be Armenians on the soil of Azerbaijan because they have lived there for centuries. for a millennium. I think that we have to look at this fairly.

The review process in the settlement has more in common with a shotgun wedding than with normal scientific merit evaluation. Under the settlement. if the reviewerswhom Texas will have a say in selectingdo not approve the $65 billion grant. the entire settlement is nullified. This sounds more like peer pressure than peer review. I hope no potential source of future funds for the linear accelerator is taken in by this unusual arrangement. Finally. Im concerned that the Department of Energy already seems to be sidling away from its initial statements that the settlement can be funded entirely from fiscal 1994 appropriations. I hope the Department proves more capable of living within cost estimates than it has in the past. Still. despite all this. and despite the covert way the Department has proceeded. I will reluctantly go along with this settlement because I believe delaying the shutdown now will cost taxpayers even more money. Theres a benefit to be gained simply in putting this entire episode behind us. In addition. my two primary concerns have been addressed. In a letter that I will include in the RECORD. the Department has pleaded that this will be the last Federal money going to the SSC site and that termination costs should be held to the level already appropriated.",

I think those of us that were involved in the nuclear debate back in the 1970s would recognize that waste productiofi was the major concern at that time. and if that nuclear could have come before America and said. \"We will not only produce nuclear wastes. we will consume waste.\" then I think there would be a whole lot of different discussion by those of us who were involved in the debate at that time. This technology not only has the capability of avoiding those pitfalls. but it also has the ability of consuming a waste problem that has been totally ignored by this body at this time. and that is the fact that there Is going to be over 100 metric tons of plutonium. militarygrade plutonium between Russia and the United States. that all we are talking about right now is putting it in the ground and hoping. hoping that somebody does not know it is there. and use it for operations we do not care about. I think one of the concerns we need to recognize is that this technology. it not only consumes waste. it not only produces power. but there is this national defense issue that I think we got to talk about.

When a similar amendment was introduced by the gentleman from Florida during the Committee on Science markup. I strongly opposed it then. and I strongly oppose it today. Today. nuclear energy produces about 20 percent of our electricity. This is the largest producer next to coal. World electricity demand is expected to triple over the course of the next century and I feel it would be extremely shortsighted to eliminate this program when we are going to need a means to meet the worlds increasing electricity demands. Living in a country which now consumes $1 billion in foreign oil imports each week. I think it is imperative to explore other energy options. The GTMHR is one of the most promising next generation nuclear reactors. As a scientist. let me tell you why I am supportive of this reactor. It combines a meltdownproof reactor and advanced gas turbine technology in a powerplant that can provide 50 percent more electrical power per unit of thermal energy than other reactors. The current design dramatically lowers the production of radioactive wastes and thermal emissions which results in a new kind of powerplant that is efficient and safe provider of lowcost electricity. Mr. Chairman. this is a prime example of the kind of technology we need to pursue and I urge a no vote on the amendment.",

Porkbarrel politics is alive and well in Washington. My colleagues may have thought that the change which took place last November would bring an end to politics as usual. But that is not the case when it comes to bringing home the pork. True. we are making significant efforts to cut overall spending to balance the budget--and I support those efforts. But despite the deep spending cuts. members of the Appropriations Committee have managed to slip wasteful. unauthorized and unrequested projects into this spending bill for the benefit of local or special interests back home. As a cochair of the Porkbusters Coalition. I rise today in strong support of the Klug amendment to cut the $20 million in this bill which is earmarked for researching an impractical nuclear technology referred to as the gas turbinemodular helium reactor. The GTMHR is a prime example of what the Federal Government ought not to be funding. This $20 million appropriation was not requested by the President in his budget and has not been authorized by the Science Committee. In fact. as a member of the Science Committee. I participated in a bipartisan vote to eliminate the GTMHR. This wasteful boondoggle was also opposed by the Reagan and Bush administrations. In addition. several expert organizations are opposed to funding the GTMHR including the National Academy of Sciences. the Electric Power Research Institute. and the Department of Energy. Mr. Chairman. over the past 30 years. American taxpayers have seen nearly 900 million of their hardearned dollars wasted on this inefficient reactor technology without any tangible benefit. Incredibly. the General Accounting Office has estimated that it will take another $5.3 billion to complete the GTMHR. I ask my colleagues: Do you think your constituents would approve of throwing more of their money into this black hole of waste? I think not. I urge my colleagues to take the high ground and suppress efforts such as this to pull a fast one on the American people. If we are insistent on cutting spending. it should begin with cutting the wasteful pork projects which are squandering taxpayer dollars. Support the Klug amendment to cut the GTMHR.",

This particular system has been endorsed and supported by a number of people who believe that nuclear power still has a role to play in this country.

Bill Lee. wrote us all a letter. wrote the chairman of this committee a letter. I would Just like to read what the chairman of that committee said.

This bill is a bad deal for Domino and other refineries. It threatens the livelihoods of thousands of American working familiesat refineries not only in Baltimore. but also in New York. in California and elsewhere. Too often. the sugar program squeezes refineries between artificially high raw cane sugar prices and low supply. The sugar program in this bill will worsen the problem. Almost half of American sugar cane refineries have gone out of business. Those refineries still in operation have faced temporary closures again and again. These disruptions create economic hardships for workers and disrupts production schedules. To give our refineries some relief. I offered an amendment called the Emergency Sugar Refiner Relief Act which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to increase imports of raw cane sugar if the price of raw cane sugar exceeds 120 percent of the loan rate. My amendment would have prevented refineries from future closings due to artificially high raw cane prices. Unfortunately. my amendment could not be accepted today but I will keep fighting for it at every opportunity. It is outrageous that our sugar program has to pit growers against refiners. There is no reason why our refiners have to be left out of the sugar program. threatening the future of this industry. Mr. President.

    "speech": "constructed the U.S. price for the 19891991 period during which 1989 and 1990 were unusually high price years for U.S. refined sugar. This exaggerated the difference between the socalled world derived price and the U.S. sweetener price. By selecting a period of world price spikes. such as 19731975. GAOs analysis would show an annual savings to domestic users and consumers of $350 to S400 million. Clearly. the expected world price of raw sugar with global liberalization Is critical to any analyses of the effects of the U.S. sugar program. In 1993. the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) estimated that sugar trade liberalization in the United States. European Union. and Japan alone would result in an average world price of 17.6 cents per pound of raw sugar2.6 cents per pound higher than GAOs derived world price. Based on the ABARE analysis and using a transportation cost of 1.75 cents per pound. which more accurately reflects global transportation costs to the United States. plus a refining spread of 4.27 cents per pound (Landell Mills Commodities Studies. Incorporated). a world price of refined sugar is estimated at 23.6 cents per pound. Based on this world price estimate and an average U.S. sweetener price over 19921994. a more normal price period. it can be shown using GAOs methodology. that there are no costs to domestic users and consumers. The estimated effects of the U.S. sugar program are highly sensitive to expected world prices if global sugar trade Is liberalized. GAOs analysis. in my judgment. does not adequately consider the complexities and dynamics of the U.S. and global sugar markets. With respect to the effects of the U.S. sugar program on Government costs of its food purchase and assistance programs. an Independent analysis by the Economic Research Service (ERS) estimates the cost at 584 million based on the difference between U.S. and world refined sugar prices in 1994. However. Just as for the GAO analysis. different effects could be estimated by using other time periods when the price gap between U.S. and world prices was smaller. Moreover. with global liberalization. the price gap would narrow because of the dynamics of adjustment which were not considered in the ERS analysis. Sincerely.",

It precludes the payment of market promotion moneys to foreign corporations. Under the current law. foreign corporations may receive money.

And when I would meet folks. meet Gambians and begin to talk to them. I would find there was in the country a certain negative feeling about Europeans. as you might expect. in a former colony. But I found that the minute I said I was a Peace Corps volunteer. a Peace Corps. the \"s\" was pronounced. although I was pronouncing the \"s\" before I got in it. the minute I said that though I found that barriers fell. just as the gentleman from Connecticut says. I found that people became more open. more willing to listen. Then as the gentleman from California said. when I began to speak Wolloff. which is the language of the Ollif people. there may be 1.5 million people in Western Africa who speak Wolloff. when I began to speak the language. certainly not with the ability to discuss nuclear physics. but with an ability to go through a number of greetings and to ask after family and friends and. to get to the point. we discussed about the total familiarity of saying \"Summa harit. sa harit.\" \"My house is your house.\" That was the phrase that really tended to bring people together and to bond us. as humans. as people who populate the Earth. I think that there is no better way for America to be represented. That is why I was very discouraged when I heard proposals which have since been dropped but proposals that would have made the Peace Corps part of the State Department.

Marijuana. Among eighth graders. twice as many have experimented with marijuana in 1993 as compared to 1991. Daily use by high school seniors in this country is up by 50 percent. The drug abuse warning network showed an 8 percent increase in drugrelated emergency room visits in 1991 due to overdoses. suicide attempts. and drugrelated diseases. The numbers go on and on. I have many. many numbers here. Approximately 70 percent of the illegal drugs coming into our country today enter by land. in cargo trucks. in cars over the Mexican border. an issue we have talked about a great deal. Over half of all cocaine. 20 percent of all heroin. and 60 to 80 percent of foreigngrown marijuana available in the United States pass through or originates in Mexico. The demand in this country is so great. We have talked a lot about putting more resources into the transit zone.

We have really come a long way. Mr. President. in our society in relatively few years. It has only been since 1963. in the landmark case of Gideon versus Wainwright. that an individual was entitled to representation in a criminal case. as Justice Hugo Black put it. before he was hauled into court. Before that time. in a criminal case there was no requirement there be a defense counsel except in capital cases. Now we have seen evolve. with community legal services. broader legal representation of the poor. a much needed. highly controversial subject which has occupied much floor time and debate here. By and large. we have maintained representation for the poor. Now there is a restriction which goes much. much too far. To have an amendment that says a recipient may use funds derived from sources other than the Legal Services Corporation to comment on public rulemaking. which is a very limited matter. hardly inspiring litigation. or to respond to a written request for information or testimony from a Federal.

I think that question has to be addressed in the Chamber as well as the viability of the commingling. of extending the full abortion rights to the District of Columbia when we are not really certain how the funds are commingled between District funds and Federal funds.

I pay a fine to the District of Columbia. and therefore they clearly have their own locally raised funds. My colleague is right. I do not believe that they should be treated differently than any other city. any other county. and any other State visavis the ability of any city. county. or State to use their own locally raised money as they will. For example. I was on the board of supervisors of a county. a suburban county north of San Francisco. a beautiful place called Matin County. and the board of supervisors there quite unanimouslywe came from different parties. different views--did give funding to Planned Parenthood for their clinic in which they. in fact. provided family planning services.

First of all. it is a limitation on the amount of money that will be spent regardless of the growth and need for children who are hungry. Second of all. your block grant requires that the Governors only spend 80 percent of that money on the school lunch program. Third of all. your block grant removes the nutritional requirements so what the children are getting does not relate to what the children may need nutritionally. So you can spread it out among more kids so that they meet certain criteria for the block grant. but it may not be more kids who need the school lunch. Therefore. the nutrition that the really needy kids are getting is good. Fourth of all. you are talking about the schoolbased lunch program. and you are cutting out the summer program and the afternoon program and the child care program.",

The previous speaker raised legitimate issues about the difference between an entitlement program and a block grant. That is the level of the discussion that we ought to have. If we have that level of discussion. then we can talk about different strategies to balance the budget. I came over here fairly upset because I am so angered to hear over and over again the use of the term \"cutting\" the funding for this program. It simply is not true. It really should not be said. The level of debate will be elevated tremendously if we talk about different strategies. whether it is entitlements or block grants. We can do that. We can have honest differences of opinion. We might actually learn from each other and find some common ground. I really would encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle to stop using the terminology of cutting funding for this program. when in fact the facts are. and I will repeat them. when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate and the White House. they provided this program with a 3.1 percent increase and the president. in this years budget. proposed 3.6 percent. and we have offered 4.5 percent for the next 5 years.

I wanted to touch on welfare and the need for welfare. but first I have to make these comments as a former Democrat. that today I was interviewed by the Washington Post wanting to know why in the State of North Carolina that we went from 8 Democratic Congressmen. four Republicans to four Republican Congressmen and fourexcuse me. eight Republican Congressmen and four Democrats. The whole purpose is simply because the new minority party was out of touch with the middleclass working American. People in America are paying. the working family will spend half of what it makes on paying taxes and actually spend more on paying taxes than it will spend on clothing. housing and food. And this debate tonight about children is extremely important. and on our side we believe we are doing what is right for children. I can tell the other side. after hearing the debate today and yesterday. that the American people are ready for downsizing Government. They are ready to see efficiency in programs. They are ready to see less taxes coming out of their paycheck. That is what I think the Republican party has done. Let me talk just briefly. I know my time is short. about the facts on welfare. Since the 1960s. Washington has spent approximately $5 trillion of taxpayers money on the war on poverty. It is the most expensive war our Nation has ever waged. and it is a war we have lost. The amount we spend in a year on welfare is roughly three times the amount needed to raise the incomes of all poor Americans above the poverty income threshold. Nearly 65 percent of the people on welfare at any given time would be in the welfare system for 8 years or longer. A record 14.3 million people now receive welfare benefits. a 31 percent increase since 1989. Funding for welfare programs is estimated to increase from $325 billion in 1993 to $500 billion in My colleagues. the people of America are demanding welfare reform. We can debate as we should debate. being a democracy. but when we really come down to it. the working people of America are tired and fed up of seeing their money wasted. It is our responsibility and obligation to pass welfare reform.",

I earnestly implore my committee chairman. the key is simply to exclude the revenues from balancing the budget in an amendment to this amendment. and that would be presented next week. I believe it is the only way to have an honest amendment. I also believe that it makes sense. There are 40 million people today on Social Security. By the time this amendment is ratified and the first balanced budget is prepared. there will be 50 million Americans on Social Security. Young people working today can expect that the money will not be there to pay for their retirement. and yet they are paying FICA taxes. That is not right. They should not have to pay if the money is not going to be there. If the money is used to balance the budget. it just brings the crunch to Social Security that much sooner. I do not think that that should be a byproduct of a balanced budget amendment. More fundamentally. I believe it is a flaw that will cause its nonratification by enough States to make it the law of the land. The bottom line is if we are going to have monetary policy in the Constitution. it is fitting. just as there are technicalities in other amendments on double jeopardy and that kind of thing. that there be an amendment which simply exempts the revenues from the trust funds that hold the FICA taxes.

Social Security is where the money is and that is why we must protect Social Security recipients. whether they be my granddaughters or whether they be me or the millions of people around this country who today depend on Social Security. The reason we must exempt Social Security from the balanced budget amendment is that Is where the money is. This year the surplus in the Social Security fund will be some $70 billion. Shortly after the turn of the century the surplus in the Social Security fund will be $800 billion. I say \"will be.\" It will be if we protect those moneys. If we do not. if we do not set aside those moneys from the balanced budget amendment. when people go to draw their Social Security. when my granddaughters go to draw their Social Security. or my children. there will be no money left. Because that is where the money is and that is how the budget will be balanced. There is no place else to get the money in those large sums.

The legislation that we are introducing today is very similar to a bill which passed both the Senate and House last year by overwhelming margins but failed to clear the Senate in the final days of the 103d Congress. This legislation. which is supported by the Department of the Interior as well as a number of other conservation and park user groups. would correct the many deficiencies of the 1965 act which currently governs concession operations inside units of the National Park System. It would end the granting of a preferential right of renewal to an incumbent concessioner. it would end the granting of a preferential right of renewal to an incumbent concessioner. it would reformulate the method by which possessory interest is valued. it would establish a competitive bidding procedure to ensure competition and that the Government receives fair value for the privilege of doing business in our national parks. and it would provide that franchise fees and other revenues collected from concessioners are available for use in the parks rather than simply returned to the Federal Treasury. In this regard. I am pleased that the bill we are introducing today includes language which I offered as an amendment during the committees deliberations last year which would authorize the Secretary to establish park improvement funds in the individual park units where franchise fees could be deposited by the concessioner and used at the direction of the Secretary of the Interior for badly needed projects in the parks. This practice is currently followed in several parks. most notably the recent Yosemite contract. and has proven very successful. I look forward to working with Senators BENNETT. BUMPERS. and others who were supportive of our efforts last year. and hope we can enact this measure early in this Congress. By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. ROBB):",

I rise to submit a resolution designating October 1996 as \"Roosevelt History Month.\" to coincide with the dedication of the new Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial now being built in the District of Columbia. A national history month celebrating the achievements of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt is an appropriate and necessary complement to the new memorial. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30. 1882. in Hyde Park. NY. and entered politics in 1910 with his election to the New York State Senate. Later. he was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy and then sought and lost a bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Despite a debilitating attack of polio. he went on to become Governor of New York in 1928. establishing New Yorks first program of unemployment relief. As President of the United States from 1933 to 1945. Franklin Delano Roosevelt guided this Nation through two of the gravest crises of the 20th century. the Great Depression and the Second World War. In so doing. he defined our national stature and secured his place as one of the greatest American Presidents of the 20th century. It is therefore fitting that our country honor his efforts. and those of his wife. with a celebration of Roosevelt History Month. Citizens and organizations across the Nation may observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities to learn about a President and a generation who gave much to the Nation.

I voted last week for Senator HARKINs amendment which says that Social Security should be exempt in any calculations required by a balanced budget. I did it to protect the Social Security trust funds and to reassure senior citizens who rely on Social Security benefits.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the Clinger amendment. The Clinger amendment will save taxpayer dollars and protect career civil servants from being drafted Into hardball political advocacy. Federal workers are routinely being pressured to participate in partisan lobbying campaigns. These lobbying efforts are often offensive to the civil servants personal values and damaging to his or her career. What do you think happens to the career employee who expects to serve during numerous Presidencies but who gets caught up in partisan lobbying efforts by his agency? Well. the next administration with a dilferent political stripe comes in and is naturally suspicious of that civil servants professional judgment and Independence. The Clinger amendment simply says: Let us leave the political talk to presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed appointees and let the dedicated career Federal workers that I represent get their jobs done free of politics. I am especially alarmed by some of the unsolicited political propaganda that was mailed to all members of the Virginia General Assembly this year by the Environmental Protection Agency. State senators and delegates complained about this junk mail that featured false statements in opposition to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 and some of the regulatory reform initiatives. I support an open and vigorous exchange of ideas. and I am proud to serve in a body that epitomizes the free exchange of political thought. While there will always be a time and place for political advocacy. our system of government depends on a dedicated corps of civil servants who actually fulfill the mission crafted by Congress and the Presidentfree of being enlisted in partisan lobbying campaigns. Surely the President. his hundreds of Senateconfirmed appointees. combined with the thousands of nonprofit and forprofit advocacy organizations in this town can adequately express the full range of diverse policy and political opinions without requiring the taxpayer to finance lobbying campaigns by Federal agencies that harm the careers of civil servants. I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this important amendment offered by the distinguished chairman of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. there are critics of lobbying reform who hold the cynical belief that if this bill can be amended. It will get bogged down In the Senate. and lobby reform will die. That would be tragic. I very much believe In the open. democratic system In our Nation where people can communicate with their elected representatives. directly or through others. To do so is an important aspect of our democracy. I also believe the American public is entitled to know who is lobbying whom. and who is spending how much. But today the lobbying disclosure system we have is chaotic and badly broken. It has so many loopholes that the public has no clear idea whatsoever about how lobbyists are spending millions of dollars. If you take the long view. this is our best chance since 1948. when President Truman called for reform of the lobbying disclosure law. to do the job. and do the job right. This bill is a good bill as it stands. The Senate supported it unanimously and its leaders on this issue played an indispensable role in its design and passage. The administration today said the President will sign this bill in its current form. And now. it is our turn. If we do this right. the American people will be able to know what they are entitled to know: Who is paying how much. to whom. to lobby Congress and the executive branch. All week long. the American people have been given one reason after another to wonder if there is any issue on which the Senate. and the House. and the President can cooperate. This is surely one such issue. Put that together with gilt ban we passed earlier tonight. and I believe we will have taken two very important steps toward restoring trust In the integrity of Government. I sincerely hope campaign finance reform will be next. and soon.",

It poses a threat to derail this reform effort. We have recounted the history of 40 years of inaction and stalemate and gridlock on this subject of lobbying disclosure reform.

No. you are not going to easily get a bill both back again through the other body and then signed by the President when it does this.

That is why I consider it essential that those of us in Congress take action to freeze our own salaries until our budget is in order. Already this year we have made significant cuts in legislative branch spending. and the budget calls for more cuts next year. The conference report does not explicitly say that we will freeze our salaries but that we can. We should enact legislation soon to implement that freeze. I believe. Mr. President. while saving $72 million is not large in the context of our entire budget. it is a step we must take.

There is no question that this budget resolution will change the future in that our deficit will be gone. But. Mr. President. it does not do it in either a fashion that I can comfortably say is fair. because it reduces. in my judgment. taxes unnecessarily and inadvisedly. It does not give us the hope that we are going to have the capacity to reverse another trend. and that is the decline of wages. salaries. and benefits of working Americans. and the trend toward increasing the concentration of wealth. I am prepared to make difficult decisions. I am prepared to join with the Republicans in changing the course of this country. in saying that we are going to do the difficult and not the easy things. I regret very much that this resolution did not survive as a bipartisan resolution. I understand that there was great enthusiasm to put an even larger tax cut and lock it in. I regret that the conference yielded to that demand. if not threat. and produced. in the end. a budget resolution that will have no bipartisan support. I think. as a consequence.

I would like to call attention to the Members and the general public of the opening of an exhibit entitled \"Defending Religious Liberty.\" on view in the rotunda of the Cannon House Office Building. U.S. House of Representatives. May 25. The focus of the exhibit is on repression of the Bahal community and portrays Americas concern for religious freedom and the response of the United States and other nations to the persecution of members of Irans largest religious minority. Those who practice the Bahai faith number 6 million In more than 205 countries with more than 100.000 worshipers in the United States. The Islamic regime calls the Bahai faith a conspiracy and heresy. Followers have no legal rights and secret documents show official Government policy is suppression of the Bahal community. Bahal students have been expelled from schools. followers have been denied food ration cards. dismissed from jobs and denied pensions. Many have disappeared. been kidnapped. jailed. tortured. and executed on account of their religion. Congress has acknowledged that the abusive treatment of the Bahais is a critical human rights concern. Although diplomatic pressure and critical publicity has elicited a positive response from the Iranian Government the Bahai community remains an oppressed minority. denied the right to elect leaders. conduct religious schools. and pursue other organized religious activities. Bahai members are composed of the mainstream of people. from different races. nationalities. and social and economic backgrounds. They believe that all people are meant to live in peace and unity and should be supported in their continuing efforts to protest against the Iranian Governments persecution of Bahais. Mr. Speaker. I hope this exhibit will remind us of the oppression of our fellow human beings. We must continue to direct our efforts toward resolving these crimes against humanity. Therefore. I propose we should never resume trade or diplomatic relations until the Islamic Revolutionary regime reverses their policy.",

The many people in Huron County and around the western portion of the Thumb of Michigan who have been helped by the quality medical care provided by the dedicated staff at this facility over the years know a quality institution when they have the good fortune to be served by it. Scheurer Hospital is named for Dr. Clare Scheurer. a physician who in 1944 was convinced that a new medical facility was needed for the people in the area who either overfilled his office. couldnt be served within the hours he had available for treating patients. or were too far away following surgery in the Bad Axe Hospital. Donations from friends and businesses in the area helped lead to the construction of the then 21bed hospital. and its official opening on April 23. 1945. Mrs. C.H. Spence was the first patient admitted. and her daughter. Margaret. was the first baby born at the hospital. Over the years this facility continued to provide excellent elective and emergency care to patients. until it was replaced by the current 47bed hospital in 1971. And an expansion and modernization program In 1985 provided more examination rooms. and an improved laboratory and pharmacy. This project was again heavily supported by the community served by this most important facility. Today the thousands of people who live in Scheurer Hospitals service area know that they can count on the 28 doctors. 40 nurses. and nearly 170 other professionals that are part of the dedicated Scheurer team under the direction of Chief Executive Officer Dwight Gascho for a wide range of medical services including orthopedics. cardiology. nuclear medicine. micro eye surgery. In the hospitals last fiscal year. there were over 3.500 emergency room visits. nearly 5.000 redicare visits. and 600 admissions. Mr. Speaker. I urge you and all of our colleagues to join me in wishing the wonderful staff of Scheurer Hospital the very best of wishes on their 50th anniversary.",

This immense admiration Is the second reason for the location of my hat collection.

These dedicated individuals have saved countless lives and billions of dollars worth of property in New York State alone. And the MedwayGrapeville Volunteer Fire Company exemplifies the kind of heroism which makes volunteer firefighters such an Important part of our local communities. During my years as a volunteer fireman. I noticed some extraordinary things about my company. Its members were among the most varied groups of people I have encountered before or since.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I join with Senator THOMPSON in a very simple amendment. I think it Is very basic. it is very fair. It is the thing we ought to do. We are in the midst of a great change. Part of that change is to get the Federal deficit under control and make Government smaller. In doing that. we are asking a lot of people to sacrifice and we are asking that a lot of programs be restrained. some cut. some eliminated. I think we must send the right signal to the American people. We must say to them we are also willing to restrain ourselves in a way that reminds us that we are in an era of restraining the budget. I think the best way to do that is to say we are not going to have any pay raises for Members of Congress in 1996. The budget resolution said we would not do that for 7 years. We cannot do that today for 7 years. I am not sure that we should. But we take it 1 year at a time. and for now we are saying. consistent with the budget resolution and our affirmations as we all voted with thatthat we want to get the deficit under control and be fairwherein we said let us not have any pay raises. we are saying that is what we want to do. No pay raises for 1996 for Members of Congress. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for offering this amendment. It is a privilege to be his cosponsor. I think the managers are doing the right thing in accepting it. It probably will become law. thanks to Senator THOMPSONS efforts. and I think the public deserves that this year. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Tennessee. Senator THOMPSON. and the Senator from New Mexico. Senator DOMENICI. Senator DOMENICI. in the budget resolution. provided that there would be no increases in salaries of Members of Congress until this budget is balanced. I think that is a fair contract with the American people. Senator THOMPSON today is implementing that decision and we must do it in every appropriations bill that comes forward. That is necessary for us to show that we are going to do what every American is doing when times are hard. By freezing the salaries. we can contribute to this ending of the budget deficit so that our children and grandchildren will have a chance to grow up with the kinds of childhoods we have been able to grow up in and love in America. So I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I thank the Senator from New Mexico and our leader for making sure that we are going to do the right thing. You have seen. the American people have seen. Mr. President. you have seen in the last few weeks and days and hours how hard it is for us to make the necessary cuts to do what is right for America. But we are going to do it. We are showing that we are going to do it. that we have the commitment. that we have the tenacity. that we have the will to do what is right. no matter how hard it is. so that our children will be able to inherit an America that is free from debt at some point in their future so that they will not have to pay taxes so onerous that they will not have the quality of life that we enjoy today.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment makes a technical correction to the 1995 Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act. The Pay Act. which was included as a separate section in the Fiscal Year 1995 Treasury Appropriations Act. commonly referred to as LEAP. contained a provision which amended section 5542 of title 5. This provision requires that the first 2 hours of scheduled overtime work by criminal investigators be calculated against availability pay hours. authorized under the act. The issue relating to the calculation of work hours for scheduled overtime compensation has been an issue of contention for certain agencies and criminal investigators alike. The current section. as written. is overly restrictive and inflexible and. thus. increases the potential for litigation. The provision. as stated in a letter received from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. is unfair and does not adequately reflect the intent of Congress. The author of this legislation. Senator DENNIS DECONCINI. attempted to clarify congressional intent in a December 1994 floor statement. Despite this clarification by the amendments sponsor. personnel regulations have gone unchanged. Flexibility is needed for the unusual circumstances surrounding Secret Service specific physical security assignments which will become extraordinarily demanding during the upcoming Presidential campagin and the United Nations General Assemblys 50th anniversary. In light of these upcoming demands it is imperative that flexibility to agency management and fairness to the agents be provided. as was originally intended by Congress. This amendment only applies to the unique circumstances surrounding Secret Service physical protection activities. The Pay Act. resulted in over $40 million in savings in fiscal year 1995 to Federal law enforcement agencies. It also prevented hundreds of millions of dollars from being spent on litigation by the Federal Government. It was endorsed by Federal law enforcement agencies. the Office of Management and Budget. and respected law enforcement associations. In order to ensure that this legislation does what it was intended to do. I urge the adoption of the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the amendment that Senator KERREY and I have sponsored on the executive service leave changes the amount of leave one can accrue and in effect be paid for at a later date. Most Federal employees right now fall under a circumstance where they can accrue 30 days. That is. you can accrue up to 30 days. but after 30 days. if you accrue more than that. you do not get it. You do not get paid for it. But currently Senior Executive Service people get special treatment. Instead of being limited to the 30 days that cverybody else gets. they get 90 days. Thus. the reason for the amendment that we have sponsored and will adopt. It moves it down to 60 days. Mr. President. my own feeling is that they ought to be treated like everyone else. They ought to be limited to 30days. But movement from 90 days to 60 days is movement in the right direction. I do intend. though. in future pieces of legislation to address this issue again. and my hope is we will eventually move this down to the same treatment everyone else gets30 days. I should be quite clear. the overtime already accumulated by personnel would remain with the employee until used. In other words. it is not retroactive and the amendment would not affect overtime accrued by Senior Foreign Service personnel. Defense Intelligence Senior Management Executive Service. the Senior Cryptological Executive Service. and the FBI and the DEA Senior Executive Service.

President Clinton still has not gotten the message that the American people have strong reservations about sending our young men and women Into an extremely dangerous situation in Bosnia when our national interests are not directly threatened. I would like to just read a quote from Philip Merrill. former Assistant SecretaryGeneral of NATO. which appeared this week in the Wall Street Journal: Our future policy seems to be to simultaneously threaten Serbs from the air. act as peacekeepers on the ground. train the Croation army. arm the Bosnian military. conduct peace negotiations. and indict Bosnian war criminals. Any one of these policies Is defensible. taken together. theyre incoherent. As flareups occur. these inherently conflicting policies will leave us powerless to act effectively. This is not a situation into which I could justify sending our young Americans. If a peace agreement is reached. and I truly hope that one is. the United States has the responsibility to help implement it. but not with ground troops. It is neither in the Presidents nor the countrys best interests to forge ahead with a plan to send United States troops to Bosnia without the full support of the American people through their representatives. H.R. 2606 sends a clear message to the President that he has not sufficiently made his case and that he is going to have to work with Congress if he wants to follow this path.

And through it all. there has been very little reason to hope. But finally. we see the possibility to end the bloodshed. Finally. we see peace talks that mean something. Finally. we have a chance to resolve this horrible conflict. And we should do nothing to interfere with that.

We should not tie the hands of our negotiators at this crucial time. We should let them do their jobs. Its not hard to understand the concern that underlies this bill. The decision to commit troops is the most difficult decision any of us will have to make. And none of us take it lightly. But that is not the issue today. The Washington Times is right: this is the wrong move at the wrong time. The President has already said: Before troops are deployed. Congress will have a debate and Congress will have an up or down vote. There is a time and place when Congress should and will be voting on this issue. But now is not that time. Congress has enough to worry about right now with the budget negotiations. This is not the time to be rushing headfirst into the very delicate negotiations on Bosnia.

And second. that when there Is no real peace. sending peacekeepers. and especially American peacekeepers is a recipe for disaster. as we have seen all too recently In Somalia. When the two. or in this case three. sides decide it is in their own interests not to continue the war. peacekeepers. like the few Americans observing the IsraeliEgyptian peace. need only binoculars and tennis rackets. Until there is a real peace. no American should become a target. When there is a real peace. supported by all sides in this tragic conflict. then and only then. American leadership may be necessary to help maintain that peace. It is important that the Congress show that leadership now. and not blindly support the Presidents illconceived and arbitrary promise of 25.000 heavy armed American troops to police an agreement that does not yet exist. This is too important for our Nation. and for the lives the brave young men and women who serve in uniform. The proper role for the United States is leader. not policeman.

The language establishes an Important requirement: no United States ground forces should be employed in Bosnia to enforce a future peace agreement until the Congress has approved such a deployment. This would give an important and necessary opportunity for Congress to debate introduction of United States troops to former Yugoslavia. Equally important. it articulates a clear decision by C-.ngress to exercise its constitutional duty with regards to war. However. I strongly object to the short time allocated for its debate. A constitutional question as important as whether Congress approves sending U.S. troops Into harms way should receive more than a few hours of consideration. This congressional debate should not be construed as representing an adequate consideration before sending United States forces to the Bosnian--or any other--conflict. For more than 40 years. Congress has allowed the executive to continuously broaden Its authority to put U.S. troops into harms way. Congress exclusive constitutional authority to initiate war Is routinely ignored by Congress and Presidents alike. Unfortunately. the current War Powers Resolution implicitly grants broad authority to the President to engage in wars of any size without advance congressional authorization. It requires the President to come to Congress only after he has put the prestige of our Nation and the lives of its soldiers on the line. I have introduced a joint resolution (H. J. Res. 95) that seeks to reform the War Powers Resolution. The House of Representatives to address the balance of Presidential and congressional authority to make war. Indeed. the Constitution demands the collective judgment of the President and Congress on the grave question of war. The time is ripe for a congressional debate on the need to restore the balance of powers between the executive and legislature as envisioned by the Framers of the Constitution. I welcome and support this legislation. However. it is my hope that Congress will spend more fully debate this issue and adopt a more effective War Powers Resolution.",

We have here an attempt by the CDC through the NCIPC. a disease control agency of the Federal Government. to bring about gun control advocacy all over the United States through seminars. through the staff members and through the funding of different efforts all over the country just on this one issue. to raise emotional sympathy for those people who are for gun control. It is a blatant attempt on the part of government to federally fund lobbying and political advocacy. Rather than calling violence a disease and guns as a germ. these people should be looking at the other root causes of crime: Poverty. drug trade. gangs. and children growing up without parental support. and the cruel trap of welfare dependency. Those things have more to do with crime control than trying to come at it from a disease definition. Ownership of guns by itself is what this particular amount of money is going to. It is not a public health threat. In fact. the violence related to guns has been found to be going down to the extent of twothirds. where we actually have a 173 percent increase in the number of guns in the United States. So it is obviously not a public health threat. because we are doing this through education and training and not through a discredited study program by the CDC through the NCIPC. Some quotes that exist from one of the officials that we pay Federal money to. what we need to try to do is to find a socially acceptable form of gun control. Experts from Harvard and Columbia medical schools have reviewed the work on firearms that this agency has done with Federal money and have stated that it displays an emotional antigun agenda and are so biased and contains so many errors of fact. logic and procedure that we cannot regard them as having a legitimate claim to be treated as scholarly or scientific literature.

Now. that was simple. was it not? Given this knowledge. one has to question why taxpayer funds were even wasted on this issue in the first place. I think I know the answer. The bottom line is that it is bothersome to some Members of this body that many Americans own firearms. Therefore. anything that can shed a negative inference on firearms. like the fact that they are dangerous. becomes worthy of taxpayer support research and political exploitation.

Those injuries cost our country more than $224 billion a year in direct medical care and rehabilitation as well as lost wages and productivity. That is an increase of 42 percent in the last decade alone. Is injury a proper subject for our Centers for Disease Control and Prevention? Of course it is. Only S2.6 million of S46.3 million goes to gunrelated research. It also goes for car crashes. What do they examine when they look at car crashes? They look at how the cars are equipped. how the cars are used. how the drivers are trained. Should we not also look at the same injury result regarding guns? Of course we should do that. Of course. we should study how we can make society safer and how we can reduce injuries. The CDC work on firearms injuries is not duplicated anywhere else in the Government. Unlike other agencies. CDC uses the same public health model to prevent firearms injury that it does with other public health problems. It identifies the problem. examines the risk factors. develops interventions. and evaluates what works. This is an area we should be addressing. CDC has done it.

AIDS. and other areas which threaten the lives of hundreds of thoLsands of Americans. And. we must not prevent critical research in the area of firearm and other injuries as well. While CDC conaucts research on the prevention and control of injuries from fires. drownings. and poisonings as well. the concern appears to be with respect to firearm injuries. CDC is not working the area of firearms injury prevention and safety for political reasons. It is working in the area because of the tremendous number of Americans injured or killed with firearms. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics. firearms injuries are in fact the fourth leading cause of years of potential life lost. and is the second leading cause of injury fatality in the United States. Firearms are the leading cause of death for African American youth ages 15 to 24. and is the second leading cause of death among white youth in this same age group. Like cancer. AIDS. and heart disease. this is a major public health problem that must be addressed. Applications for the CDCs injury control research grants are peer reviewed by the scientific community prior to funding. In fact. its peer review process is modeled after that used by the National Institutes of Health which we strongly support. For over three decades now. firearms fatalities have steadily increased in the United States. It is projected that if current trends continue. by the year 2000. they will be the leading cause of injury death. the World Health Organization has in fact issued a resolution declaring that violence is a leading worldwide public health problem. and designating the prevention of violence as a public health priority.

This funding was cut in committee in a misguided attempt to stop the NCIPCs research into the prevention of firearms injuries. based on the allegation that such research masquerades as Governmentfunded gun control advocacy. The cut also represents a profound misunderstanding of the important work of the NCIPC. The NCIPC is tasked with undertaking medical and scientific studies of issues affecting the public health. Such work is validated by a number of improvements in public health in recent decades. particularly as it relates to automobiles. Scientific research into car accidents has led to improvements in car design. road engineering. driver education. and drunkdriving prevention. Mr. Chairman. regardless of our views on gun control. there seems to be general agreement in this body that our Nation is suffering an epidemic of gun violence. Firearms are the secondleading cause of death for children and young adults. In 10 States they are the leading cause.

NCIPCs research on firearms violence may bring improvements in gun design. training. and methods of storage. Moreover. the committee cut in NCIPC funding will not end the centers firearms research. Instead. the center is likely to reallocate funds from other important violence prevention programs. such as combating violence against women.

S. 652. the pending bill. adds new procedures to permit foreign ownership of common carrier licenses if the Federal Communications Commission [FCC) determines that the home country of the proposed foreign owner offers reciprocal and equivalent market opportunities to Americans. The ExonDorganByrd amendment clarifies that nothing in the new section limits or affects the application of the ExonFlorio law (50 App. 2170) which gives the President the power to investigate and if necessary prohibit or suspend a merger. takeover or acquisition of an American company by a foreign entity when the national security may be affected by such transaction. Where the proposed FCC procedure would permit the foreign acquisition of a U.S. telecommunications company and its common carrier licenses. it is important to make clear that the new FCC procedure does not preempt existing law affecting foreign mergers. acquisitions and takeovers. Most importantly. our proposed amendment would give the President 15 days to review actions of the FCC. Under this provision. the license could be granted only if the President does not object within 15 days. As Commander in Chief. and the conductor of foreign policy. there may be information available to a President which would not or should not be available to the FCC in making its findings under the proposed procedure in S. 652. The ExonDorganByrd amendment assures that the President gets the final say if a common carrier license is granted to a foreign entity. This amendment should be noncontroversial and in no way undermines the foreign investment and ownership reforms of S. 652. It preserves important national security. foreign policy and law enforcement powers of the President. I urge my colleagues to support this short but critically important amendment.",

The bill gives the Pentagon $9.5 billion more than they asked for and the rule will keep anyone from changing that. As far as I am concerned. $9.5 billion is a lot of money. $9.5 billion could send 1.6 million children to Head Start. It could put 268.818 new police officers on the street. It could even go so far as to clean up the Boston Harbor. I wonder why Republicans are insisting on giving the Pentagon more money than it needs when we are having trouble paying for the things we do need? If my colleagues are truly interested in cutting spending. especially unnecessary spending. why do they refuse to allow people to cut some of the wasteful spending out of this bill? A number of Members have some very good ideas on how to save a lot of money and cut out a lot of unnecessary military spending.

Those priorities are exactly wrong. Mr. Speaker. as we might say to our kids. \"We need to clean up our room before we use our allowance to buy new toys.\" Through its environmental management programs. the Department of Energy carries out the work of cleaning up places like Rocky Flats site. in my district. and other sites around the country. facilities where America developed and built the nuclear weapons that helped us win the cold war. Those cleanup coists are part of the cost of that victory. They have to be paid. And while the possible benefits of Increased spending beyond what the Defense Department has asked for on star wars are highly speculative. there is absolutely nothing speculative about the benefits in health and safety that we will gain by expending these necessary funds for cleaning up Rocky Flats and the other weapon sites.

What is it they are trying to protect? Well. Mr. Speaker. I say to my colleagues. you heard earlier from Mrs. SCHROEDER from Colorado. and youll hear later from others. there are a number of things they want to protect. They want to protect the procurement process at the Pentagon. You know. it came out that they lost $15 billion in the procurement process over the last 10 years which they cant account forsimple bookkeeping errors. Do you think there is any other segment of the Federal Government where. if there was a $15 billion scandal. that we wouldnt be in full cry on the floor of the House. amendment after amendment. hiearings. special investigations. special committees? But hey. the Pentagon just lost $15 billion. So they cant account for itminor clerical errorand there will be no substantive amendments to overhaul the procurement process at the Pentagon in this bill. They will not be allowed for under this rule. Then there is the little item of the Office of Support Aircraft. In a GAO report that Senator GRASSLEY and I obtained it says that we are probably 50 to 75 percent overbuilt for administrative support aircraft. that is. we are at such a point where every onestar general at the Pentagon. every deputy junior assistant secretary. is taking a helicopter to go to Andrews Air Force base to get on their private jet planes and fly off to routine meetings at extraordinary costs to the Federal taxpayers. The estimates of GAO say we could save $200 million a year from this account and meet the legitimate defense and military requirements of this country. We spent $275.000 to send the Air Force Cadets to Hawaii. That is a scandal.",

    "speech": "said recently that the \"downsized. laidoff workers in a time of high unemployment\" will be hurt the most by the opportunity wage. I would point again to the figures released recently by the Department of Labor that show that unemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent. the lowest level in 6 years. and that wages are up to $11.82 per hour on average. President Clinton hailed the numbers as showing that \"wages for American workers are finally on the rise again. These figures indicate that the laidoff steelworker and the officeworker with 30 years of experience that Senator KENNEDY spoke of are not going to be earning the opportunity wage. Instead. the opportunity wage is going to allow access to the job market for unskilled workers with little or no job experience. workers who otherwise would not have been hired at all. My amendment delays the implementation of the minimum wage increase until January 1. 1997. This delay will help small businesses adjust and minimize job loss. This is particularly true for small retailers that hire more workers during the holiday season. A delay is also important for employers that have committed to hiring teenagers for summer jobs. As Federal funding for summer youth job programs dries up. we must support private efforts. Americas small businesses have been extremely successful and have created the vast majority of new jobs in the last decade. If we want this level of growth to continue. and if we want to give Americas workers the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of some of todays most profitable businesses. we must protect these businesses from Federal mandates.

These are the ones they understand all too well. Many have not had a raise in 5 years. They have not seen an increase in the minimum wage more than once in the last 15. Many of them now have lost ground. The question before us is very simple: Should 13 million Americans get a raise? It should not matter where you work or how long you have been working. Anyone who works 40 hours a week should not have to live in poverty. We have all made our speeches as passionately as we know how about the need to improve our welfare system. There is no better way to get people off welfare than to give them a Job that pays something beyond a minimum wage. so that they are not relegated to poverty for the rest of their lives. We have all talked about how profamily we are. Nothing could be more profamily than to ensure parents have a working wage. that instead of working two or three jobs. they can work one and tend to their children at those times when otherwise they would have to work. So the choice is very clear. Either we vote for this increase or sentence millions of workers to even more poverty and family troubles than they are experiencing right now. No one should be confused about the amendments. The Bond amendment guts the minimum wage bill. As the National Retail Federation said. this is the best chance to defeat the minimum wage bill. The Kennedy amendment will strengthen it. We have a chance to do something positive today. We should do it in a bipartisan way. We have done it before and passed votes on the minimum wage in this Chamber. The House of Representatives did it just 6 weeks ago. We can do it. too. this afternoon.

The Senate rose to the occasion to have the minimum wage. President Clinton can sign this bill with pride. Enough is enough is enough. It has been a long time since Congress acted to make the minimum wage a living wage. Along with Social Security and Medicare. the minimum wage is one of the three most successful social programs ever enacted. In this context we have protected Social Security. we have protected Medicare. and today we are protecting the minimum wage. Todays vote means that millions of Americans will soon receive the long overdue increase they deserve in the minimum wage. Todays vote means that a solid majority of the Senate has kept the faith with the fundamental principle of the minimum wage. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. Todays vote means that minimum wage workers are no longer the invisible Americans. We see them every daythe child care workers who care for children. the health care aides who care for patients in hospitals. and senior citizens in nursing homes. teachers aides who labor in the classroom to educate their pupils. and the millions of other Americans who work hard days and long hours to make America work. Their work is Indispensable to our country. And today the Senate gave them a helping hand. The minimum wage has not gone up in 5 years. We all know that the gap between the rich and poor is widening in America. The economy may be doing well. But the benefits are flowing primarily to those at the top. Corporate downsizing and layoffs may not affect the wealthy. but the vast majority of Americans are being left out and left behind. and those at the bottom of the ladder are being left farther behind.

And cutting back on the earnedincome tax credit for those people that make $25.000 to $27.000 and are trying to provide for their children. They oppose an increase in the minimum wage. Now they are doing it with regard to a national law on the right to work. and they are also doing it in terms of the TEAM Act. Can we look against that background and say. Oh. we have here a TEAM Act that really is in the interests of those working families. when we have the solid record of what the majority has been attempting to do to working families? You have a tough time convincing me of that. Mr. President. You have a tough time convincing me of that.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to speak in strong support of the TEAM Act. I commend Senator KASSEBAUM. chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. for bringing this bill out of committee and making it a high priority. I think it is useful to begin with a review of why this legislation is necessary. Because the Idea of employeremployee communication and cooperation seems so fundamental. it is astonishing to some people that this measure must be debated at all let alone the fact that it Is so controversial. In 1992. the National Labor Relations Board issued a decision in the Electromation case which held that employeremployee committees to discuss workplace procedures and policies violated the National Labor Relations Act. As a former union member. I understand full well the NLRAs prohibition on socalled company unions. But. the Boards decision in Electromation. which defines a \"quality circle\" or \"child care center feasibility committee\" or other form of employeeemployer committee as a company union. misses the mark entirely. It simply cannot be claimed at the NLRA was intended to outlaw erery type of employeeemployer input mechanism. To state otherwise is to advocate that workers can communicate with employers only through unions. Since when does the U.S. Government impose that kind of gag rule on American workers? I can hardly believe that my colleagues on the other side are going along with this twisted interpretation of labor law. But. I suppose S35 million from the AFLCIO could be a powerful incentive to grant organized labor such a special privilege at the expense of the rank and file.",

It is illegal to discuss the possibility of providing a soda machine. microwave. or other furnishings for the employee lounge. It is illegal to discuss tornado warning procedures or rules about fighting. It is illegal to discuss a ban on radios or the use of video game machines. It is illegal to discuss rules about posters. drug and alcohol testing. dress codes. or a smelly propane buffer. It is illegal to discuss sponsoring a company softball team. I cannot believe that there is a single Senator who would defend such obstruction to cooperation and employee input in decisionmaking. And. it seems pretty incongruous to me that an American institution that claims to want to give workers a louder voice In their workplaces Is leading the opposition. It seems as if organized labor is afraid of empowering workers. It seems that organized labor does not want workers to have their own voice. It seems that organized labor not only does not condone employers who seek out workers opinions on workplace issues. but also demands that such openness continue to be punished by law.

LBL supports a $400 million regional tourism industry and provides highquality recreation and environmental opportunities to over 2 million visitors a year. Mr. Chairman. TVA has been working to create a new public and private partnership to increase the rate of return from LBL. User fees are being collected from the public. and the need for Federal subsidies is expected to decrease as management builds more efficiencies into the LBL system.

Although I appreciate the serious budgetary constraints under which the committee is operating. I fear that this reduced level of funding will frustrate TVAs ability to manage a smooth transition to LBL selfsufficiency. In the past. TVA has used stewardship account funds to support functions of LBL. To the extent that TVA is able to realize reductions. savings. or efficiencies.

Our State has more volunteers serving than any other State in the Union. 827 this year alone. A recent study by the University of Maryland found that 85 percent of the public support maintaining or increasing Peace Corpss budget. The Peace Corps consumes only $1.50 of every $10.000 spent by the Federal Government. These dollars are well and costeffectively spent. In Kazakhstan. volunteers are teaching English to 3.000 primary. secondary. and university students. in Armenia the first independent radio station in the country was established with help from the volunteers. in Cameroon. volunteers helped to develop a textbook for teaching AIDS prevention. The result is there are 5.000 students learning how to prevent AIDS. In Ghana. over 1 million seedlings are planted each year to help volunteers helping in the prevention of erosion. Mr. Speaker. let me conclude by just saying that the Peace Corps has had over 30 years of bipartisan support. It has earned this support because everyone knows that the Peace Corps works. Just ask the villager who learned how to irrigate his farm. or the hundreds of people who did not die from parasites because their doctors were taught how to prevent them. or the thousands of students around the world that now speak English because of the Peace Corps teaching them English.

These brave. civicminded people give freely of their time so that should disaster strike. we know that our friends and neighbors are there to help. Few realize the depth of training and hard work that goes into being a member of the rescue squad. Rescue squad members undergo a training series over a 4- to 6month period which includes instruction in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation [CPR]. vehicle extrication. emergency driving. and rescue orientation. In addition to this training. rescue squad members also meet monthly to address business concerns as well as hear guest speakers. Rescue squad members are volunteers. They receive no pay for what they do. What also makes their service especially outstanding is that the organizations themselves receive no funding. They receive no funding from the city. the county. or the Federal Govemment Rescue squads are funded in the same spirit of community volunteerism which move them to serve. Family. friends. and neighbors pitch in at bake sales. road blocks. and fish frys to help those who sacrifice their time for the benefit of the whole community. Committing such an amount of spare time and energy to a job so emotionally and physically taxing requires a sense of devotion and duty for which we are all grateful.",

In the coming months. the library will open its new Asian center at the Flushing branch. a unique facility servicing the heart of the Asian community east of the Mississippi River. expand its highly popular and successfully latchkey and homework assistance programs that currently helps 35.000 children a year. and complete the networking of its branches with the main library to make even more resources available via computers to the communtty at large. The Queens Library is simply an amazing place. Last year. it developed a special exhibit on Lewis Lattimer. an AfricanAmerican inventor and engineer who worked with Edison on developing the electric light. It also displayed the oldest books printed with metal moveable type. brought all the way from Korea. It set up a database of community services for Queens residents. and even won the annual dragon boat race. Mr. Speaker.

Frankly. we have not done that because we -figure we need some of the savings. But when you put a budget down. you have to stand by it. You cannot find excuses and say it really is not real. The second point is. we are fully aware that it would be grossly unfair. and probably not good for the country. to not get the entitlement cuts and insist on all of the discretionary. You would have some things out of proportion. and you probably would not get a balance. If you read the report and the resolution. it says if. in 1998. the entitlement savings have not occurred. then the caps are off discretionary accounts. That is not of great help. but it does at least make the point that we are fully aware that to get the balance. you have to have the entitlement savings. you cannot just do the discretionary accounts.

I would like to engage in a colloquy with him about a point the Senator from West Virginia made. -I have been listening to part of the debate and participating in part of the debate. I found the representation both on the floor of the Senate and even in the newspaper this morning very interesting. It says \"House Narrowly Passes Balanced Budget Plan.\" which is the plan we are talking about here. This is the plan the House narrowly passed yesterday. described as a \"balanced budget plan.\" This piece of paper is on every Senate desk. It is laying here on mine. but every Senate desk has it. and this is the actual conference report. On page 4 of the actual conference report. it says. \"Deficits.\" and then in the year 2002. it says. \"$103 billion in deficits.\" The Senator from North Dakota. Senator CONRAD. has spoken on this before as well. but it seems to me what this does is technically comply with the law. because the law says that you cannot use Social Security trust funds to portray in a piece of legislation like this that you have balanced the budget. But with the exception of this notation on page 4 that the deficit is going to be $103 billion in 2002. with the exception of that one. notation. every other piece of information given on the floor of the Senate. every speech given by the majority that brings this to the floor alleges this is a balanced budget. Is it just out of step. I guess. with common practice to be able to ignore what you put in the legislation and claim something different? Can Senator CONRAD answer that question? I guess the question I would ask is. what is the circumstance that allows this kind of hoax to continue?",

I mean. honestly stated. to take the retirement funds of the people of the United States and throw those into the pot and call it a balanced budget. frankly. borders on laughable. There is a $103 billion deficit by the year 2002 under this plan. Sometimes I think the media just do not get it. They are reporting on what we call the unified budget. The unified budget is when you put everything into the same pot and then you see whether you have balance or not. The problem with that. of course. is that includes Social Security. all of the receipts and all of the expenditures. Social Security is not contributing to the deficit. as the Senator from North Dakota knows. Social Security is in surplus. substantial surplus. And that is going to continue. In fact. those surpluses are going to grow. and the reason we put a plan in place to have Social Security surpluses grow is because we are getting ready for when the baby boom generation retires. But. of course. we are not getting ready. we are spending every dime. As a result. to call these balanced budgets is not accurate. It is misleading.",

So $525 billion of Social Security surpluses are going to be looted or raided. or whatever terminology one wants to apply in order to claim a balanced budget. This is not a balanced budget. In fairness. I think one ought to say the Presidents plan is also not a balanced budget. Even the plan that I was part of. part of the centrist coalition. was not truly a balanced budget. None of these plans are truly balanced budgets. In fact. the only plan that we have had a chance to vote on in the last 2 years that was truly a balanced budget was the one I offered last year. and the Senator from North Dakota supported it. the fair share balanced budget plan. That did balance without counting Social Security surpluses. It is the only budget that has been voted on on the floor on the Senate that was a true balanced budget plan. That got 39 votes here in the U.S. Senate. Obviously. 39 votes does not prevail. I just say. the media. when they report. ought to tell the people accurately and honestly what has happened. Because to take retirement funds and throw those into the pot and call it a balanced budget. if we were doing that in the private sector. if in any company you took the retirement funds of employees. threw those into the pot. and said you were balancing the budget. you would be headed for a Federal institution. It would not be the U.S. Congress. It would be a Federal facility. a law enforcement facility. You would be headed for Federal prison because that is a violation of Federal law.",

The Airport Busway used former railroad rights of ways as dedicated roadways for transit buses that travel free from local traffic congestion. This project is ranked as one of the most costeffective in the country and the Port Authority of Allegheny County has already completed a full funding grant agreement with the Federal Government. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is also depending on the Airport Busway to provide an alternative to the Ft. Pitt Tunnel and Bridge which is the main Interstate 279 link between the city of Pittsburgh and the suburban area south of Pittsburgh. The tunnel is scheduled to be closed for renovation and PennDOT is depending on the Airport Busway to provide an alternative to this bridge which is one of the busiest traffic points in the city. The Airport Busway began construction last year and is scheduled to be completed by 1997. Stopping this project at this point would be catastrophic for the city of Pittsburgh and the port authority.

This amendment would restore funding to fiscal year 1995 levels and help correct some of the current funding inequities which disadvantage rural transit programs. Without the funding called for in this amendment. many rural transit agencies would be forced to deal with steep reductions in service and face enormous financial obstacles just to survive. Relief is clearly needed to ensure that residents in rural areas are not isolated due to a lack of access to transit. Rural residents currently receive a disproportionately small share of transit funding. despite the significant need for such assistance. The amendment helps close this substantial gap and ensures that rural residents receive a more fair share of the transit dollars. Clearly. rural transit agencies are much more dependent on Federal assistance than those in urban areas. Unfortunately. the proposed reductions would have an immediate and detrimental effect on many of these rural transit agencies which often provide vital transit service for many individuals. including the elderly and the disabled.

I rise in strong support of the Vento amendment to H.R. 5 which will ensure that the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act will not apply to laws and regulations that involve lifethreatening public health and safety measures. The amendment clearly recognizes the Federal Governments steadfast responsibility in protecting the health and safety of the American public. If we ignore this responsibility. the result will be devastating. If the act passes without the Vento amendment. lardfills. incinerators. hazardous waste dumps. toxic waste storage facilities. and manufacturers could pollute our air and our water unchecked by oversight of the Federal Government. This rampant pollution will have a severe negative impact on the health of the American public. Children. the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to diseases caused by environmental pollution. Many respiratory diseases and several forms of cancer are directly attributable to environmental causes. These polluting facilities are disproportionately likely to be located in lowincome and minority communities. Currently. dust from a concrete recycling plant in the city of Huntington Park in my district is polluting that communitys air and water. Both the local rate of respiratory infection and of asthma in children have risen alarmingly since the plant began operation. The citizens of that community are now turning to the government for assistance and protection against this threat to their health. The industry assumption is that people living in these communities are politically weak and so consumed by the daily grind of making a living that they will not have the resources to organize against these facilities. as people in upper income communities tend to do. Unfortunately. this assumption is firmly grounded in the reality of many communities throughout our country. The Federal Government must not abandon its role in protecting the health of all Americans. particularly the most vulnerable in our country. As Representatives of our respective communities. we have a clear obligation to protect the health and safety of the American people. It we abandon it now. we may cause damage to future generations before our mistake can be corrected. I urge the passage of the Vento amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. legislative mandates made by the Federal Government have placed a significant financial burden on communities in California. The city of Los Angeles estimates that Federal mandates will cost approximately S2.2 billion over 5 years (199394 through 199798). In recent years. many Federal mandates have been placed on cities like Los Angeles without Federal funding required for implementing and enforcing these mandates. Despite the attention to this issue. these Federal mandates have not subsided. The National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices is currently in the process of recommending improvements in traiticcontrol devices. including street signs. to the Federal Highway Administration. In its present form. the National Committees proposal recommends new Federal guidelines that would require communities to: First. increase the size of the street sign lettering from 4 inches to 6 inches high. and second. modify street name signs to be reflective or illuminated. The proposed guidelines do not contain any provisions for cities to fund these changes. The citys department of transportation has reviewed this proposal and believes that the suggested requirements are extreme and unnecessary. The cost to change the more than 150.000 street name signs in the city would be approximately $10 to $15 million. Without financial assistance. the city of Los Angeles is not in a position to comply with the proposed new guidelines for street signs. Furthermore. in an urban area such as Los Angeles. many intersections are sufficiently illuminated and often feature additional identifying signs for drivers of motor vehicles. While this is one small example of a much larger problem. it is indicative of the costly Federal mandates imposed on local governments. With this in mind. I respectfully urge House Members to support H.R. 5. the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am distressed at the latest outbreak of violence in Liberia. Yesterday. young gang members fired upon the U.S. Embassy. prompting the marines to return fire. Fortunately. no Americans were injured. Since this exchange. the situation in Monrovia has calmed down and the State Department has called this an isolated incident. Nevertheless. this spasm of violence demonstrates the intractability of the conflict in Liberia and the need for a diplomatic solution. I believe the United States should remain committed to securing a peaceful solution in Liberia. I applaud the work of Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. George Moose. and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William Twaddell. Their diplomatic efforts to implement a ceasefire are important to U.S. national interests. In addition. I commend the administrations response of providing $30 million in logistical assistance to the West African Peacekeeping force. ECOMOG. Such assistance is necessary to keep ECOMOG actively engaged in the ontheground peace process. Mr. President. I call upon the various warlords to respect the ceasefire and to pursue a peaceful solution. In addition. it is important to remind the warlords that an attempt by any faction to seize power by force or to undo the Abuja Accords will receive a strong American response. While the ultimate resolution of the crisis remains the responsibility of the Liberians. the United States has an important role to play. The United States is the most influential foreign power in Liberia. The United States must remain committed to seeking peace in Liberia. An engaged United States can help a Liberia that wants peace.",

However. we are quickly running out of time. The American public deserves to know the advantages and disadvantages of legalized gambling. The Commissions report will be an important national resource for policymakers at all levels of government. In order to make this happen. we need to move quickly to make room on the Senate calendar and to insure the passage of the Gambling Impact Study Commission Act.

He works diligently helping those who help us in times of crisis. Steve Austin may remember President Johnsons words back in 1966. because 3 years prior. Steve Austin began his service as a volunteer firefighter. Today. he continues to respond to emergency calls as a member of the Aetna Hose. Hook and Ladder Company of Newark. DE. Along with his work as chairman and firefighter. Steve Austin. continues to serve as a fire claims superintendent for the State Farm Fire and Casualty Company. external affairs representative for the International Association of Arson Investigators. chairman of the NFPA Technical Committee on Fire Investigator Professional Qualifications. and as a member of the Delaware State Fire Police. In the past. he has been president of the New Castle County Volunteer Firemens Association and also president of the Delaware Chapter International Association of Arson Investigators. During his distinguished career. Steve Austin has received the George H. Parker Distinguished Service Award. the Life Membership Award. and the Presidential Award from the International Association of Arson Investigators. Steve Austin is committed to meeting the new challenges faced by the fire services. I am confident that as long as there are dedicated people like him. the fire service will continue to serve us with the heroism. bravery and professionalism that we have all come to expect.

The premise underlying this constitutional amendment is straightforward. It is one of fiscal responsibility.

Now there are any number of reasons that Members could choose to vote this down. They could vote it down because we already have a rule that requires a threefifths vote to increase taxes and every time that it has applied to legislation the Committee on Rules has waived that rule. They could vote it down because It is bad public policy. It says essentially that whatever is in the Tax Code now stays because it is going to be almost impossible to change it. It is going to be impossible to close the corporate loopholes. Even things like capital gains reductions which are expected to increase revenue would be in violation of this legislation which says thata piece of legislation that increases revenues by more than a de minimis amount requires a twothirds vote. They could vote it down because this debate has already occurred. This debate took place during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Article IX of the Articles of Confederation required a supermajority vote to increase taxes. and it was found that it did not work. So they had to go back. They had to correct it because they realized that on a tough vote it is hard enough to get a majority of Members to do the courageous and right thing. let alone twothirds of the body.",

If you say that you require twothirds. then the majority does not have an equal vote. The people who have a disproportionate vote are those in the minority because it only takes onethird plus one to prevent the will of the majority from becoming law. Now this is particularly applicable in the Senate. In the Senate. as you know. every State. no matter how many people are in that State. have two Senators. There are 17 States that represent. less than 10 percent of the American population. Those 17 States just happen to be represented by 34 Senators. onethird plus one.

Now imagine. why should 10 percent of the people be represented by people who can thwart the bill of the majority of 90 percent of the population?

I do not think we need to be specific. but we know that there are about $400 billion of tax preferences in our Tax Code where people can make a legitimate argument of uneven treatment.

I think you said that there were 10 States. or 10 percent of the population had 34 Senators. I am going to just read the presentment clause in the Constitution. It says: Every bill shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate before it becomes a law. be presented to the President of the United States. \"Shall have passed.\" It does not say \"shall have passed by a majority.\" or \"shall have passed by a supermajority.\" It just says \"shall have passed.\" In the original Constitution there were 7 twothirds supermajority requirements: Conviction in impeachment trials. article II. section 3. clause 6. expulsion of a Member of Congress. article I. section 5. clause 2. override of a Presidential veto. article I. section 7. clause 2. quorum of twothirds of the States to elect the President. article II. section 1. clause 3. consent to a treaty. article II. section 2. clause 2. proposing constitutional amendments which is what we are doing today. article V. and State ratification of the original Constitution. article VII. Since that time. there have been 3 additional twothirds supermaJority vote requirements added to the Constitution. which brings the number to 10. The purpose of a supermajority requirement. in my opinion. and if you read the Federalist papers and some of the writings of James Madison. it was felt that if the issue was large enough that it needs more than a slim majority. that you really need consensus. you need a supermajority or a twothirds vote. Certainly in todays era. it is this gentlemans opinion that raising taxes any higher than they already are is one of those occasions that we need to amend the Constitution and require a supermajority.",

I believe the gentlemans recitation proves my point. because none of the examples that the gentleman cites for requiring supermajorities has anything to do with the presentment clause. None of those examples involves the presentment of legislation to the President for his approval or disapproval or veto. In fact. they all have to do with extraordinary matters in the course of conducting the businesb of the country. None of them has to do with the core legislative responsibilities of the Congress. And in fact. it is very clear from the fact that the framers. during the course of the Constitutional Convention. considered and rejected several times proposals to attach supermajority requirements to particular legislative matters. that it was not contemplated by them that the presentment clause could be some kind of excuse. covering the advisability of any supermajority requirement for regular legislative business. So the gentlemans points are accurate as far as they go. They simply are irrelevant to the validity or not of the argument about the importance of majority rule as a central tenet of free government.",

Sri Lanka has enjoyed independence from British colonial rule these past 48 years and exemplifies a political system and history steeped in democratic tradition. During the past four decades Sri Lanka has held regular national elections and has enjoyed traditionally friendly relations with the United States. based in large part on our shared commitment to democratic principles. Sri Lanka has experienced some ethnic strife related to Tamil separatists and we encourage newly elected President Chandrika Kumaratunga to find a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict. During the past half century. Sri Lanka has served as a glowing example of a young democratic country that has overcome numerous hardships to make tremendous strides in the political. international. economic. and cultural arena. Sri Lanka has much to be proud of. Of note is the high 90percent literacy rate for both men and women which can be attributed to a Government policy of free public education from primary through the university. These policies will create and foster a vigorous economy and strengthen even further our trade relationship. Happy Fourth of February to Sri Lanka on its National Day.",

In January Congress passed and the President signed a continuing resolution that paid 285.000 Federal employees who were not able to work between December 16 and January 5 because of the 3week lapse in appropriations for part of the Federal Govemment. This shutdown also imposed a serious financial hardship on many of the 476.000 Federal workers who were not paid during this period even though they were working. The shutdown of the Federal Government hurt many private firms. both those that normally sell to Federal employees and those that have Federal contracts. They were unable to recoup the business lost during the shutdown. Last week I introduced a bipartisan bill to prevent such harmful consequences if there should be another lapse in appropriations in the future. H.R. 2963. the Keep the Government Open Act of 1996. amends that AntiDeficiency Act to permit Federal employees to continue to work and to be paid during a lapse in appropriations. if the President determines that a sufficient appropriation is likely to be made before the end of the fiscal year. The other original consponsors of this bill are Mr. DAVIS. Mr. HOYER. Mr. MORAN. MS. NORTON. and Mr. WYNN.

I have felt for some time that the United States made a rirtake in recognizing the Peoples Republic of China and derecognizing Taiwan. sometimes referred to as the Republic of China. My position for a long time was that we should recognize both Chinas. as we recognized both Germanys. That did not prevent East Germany and West Germany from uniting as one country. But when the mistake was made of playing the China card. in large measure in response to the Soviet Union and Its perceived threat. we had set up a situation that potentially could mean military trouble in Asia. The New York Times carried a story on Saturday. November 18. by Patrick E. Tyler that talks about an improvement in United States ties but a worsening of ChinaTaiwan ties. I am concerned about any leadership that could emerge In dictatorial China that might be a threat to the free Government of Taiwan.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today marks the 20th anniversary of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). I was proud to serve on the committee that approved IDEA in 1975. and I am proud of its successes in the past two decades. For millions of children with disabilities. IDEA has meant the difference between exclusion and participation. between dependence and independence. between lost potential and learning. Before IDEA was enacted in 1975. young people with disabilities were often shut away and condemned to life without hope. In 1975. 4 million handicapped children did not receive the help they needed to succeed in schooleither because their disabilities were undetected or because schools did not offer the services they needed. Virtually no disabled preschoolers received services. A million schoolaged children with disabilities were excluded from public school. Now. as a result of IDEA. every State in the Nation offers a free appropriate public education to the 5 million children with disabilities. and provides early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities. In the early 1970s. 95.000 children with disabilities lived in institutional settings. Today. fewer than 6.000 are institutionalized. Only 33 percent of people with disabilities who grew up before IDEA were competitively employed within 5 years after leaving school. Today. nearly 60 percent of young men and women with disabilities become productive. taxpaying members of society. In some respects. as we know. IDEA has fallen short. Too many students with disabilities drop out of school and have a high risk of unemployment. Some get in trouble with the law and spend a significant amount of time in Jail. Enrollment of students with disabilities In college is still too low. We need to be more vigilant in our mission to make sure that all these children grow up with the skills they need to get a Job and live independently. Legislation to reauthorize IDEA will be considered by Congress in the coming months. and I look forward to working closely with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve these important goals. The best way for all of us to honor the laws success is to rededicate ourselves to making it even more effective In the future.",

Dr. Halverson provided guidance and counsel to the Senate as its Chaplain. continually reminding us of the true meaning of leadership. For Dr. Halverson a true leader was first a servant. He reminded us each and every day. as he strolled these halls. of what it means to serve the people around you. I have said before that Dr. Halverson was one of the most Christlike men I have ever known. and today that sentiment has not changed. Even in failing health. he continued his ministries right to the very end. Those of you who remember him. recall his humble spirit. his compassionate heart. and his penetrating intellect. All of these qualities were supplemented with an uncanny ability to address complex issues with an insightful simplicity that cut to the core of an issue. illuminating the vital components so that even a child could understand. Dr. Halverson will be profoundly missed. He will be missed by the Senators. but this mournful occasion will impact all who are involved in the business of Congress. Dr. Halverson was not just a pastor to the hundred men and women who serve in this body. but he was a pastor to the police officers. to the custodians. to the food servce workers. to everyone who was fortunate to cross his path. He ministered to all he encountered. indiscriminate of position. background. and stature. He genuinely loved everyone. I cannot recall him ever uttering an ill word toward anyone. I am deeply saddened by this great loss. Dr. Halverson was my close friend and brother. Now. Dr. Halverson is experiencing joy and happiness incomprehensible to those of us here on Earth. But until I see him again. I will miss this good and faithful servant. I will miss his warm greetings. I will miss his thoughtful prayers. I will miss his example of humility. Most of all.

My good friend. Tom Lazzaro. is among a rare breed of hardy but compassionate leaders of young folks Nho found themselves learning both from his wise counsel and disarming compassion. Beginning his career at the college in 1964. he genuinely epitomized the dual role of teacher and coach. becoming one of our Nations premiere college tennis coaches. Highly respected among his peers. he served as president of the National Junior College Athletic Mens Tennis Coaches Association from 19741994. He was inducted into three different halls of lame: the National Junior College Athletic Association Mens Tennis in 1992. the Dade County Tennis in 1995 and the Florida Community College Activities Association in this same year.

The Hebrew Free Loan Association of Detroit was founded in 1895 to provide loans to Jewish people in the Detroit metropolitan area. Over the last century. this revered institution has made loans without interest to assist people in small businesses. and other endeavors with a particular emphasis on aiding people to do productive work. The Hebrew Free Loan Association has also provided aid to waves of immigrants and refugees arriving in the Detroit area. A critical part of its mission has been to assist these newcomers in getting their start in America and in bringing their relatives from the old country to join them. Many of our families in the Jewish community have benefited from such loans and have gone on to become successful and to help others. Remarkably. historically. more than 96 percent of the loans made have been repaid. Mr. President. this is an organization with old and strong roots in Jewish tradition. the Detroit community. and in American values.

Corporate Air has grown to employ over 300 people and serve a national and international market. Mike has been an ambassador for Montana and America. And Corporate Air has created new jobs both here and abroad. Today. they are leaders in an overseas market that appears limitless. That is what teamwork and Corporate Air is all about. This company was years ahead of the industry in recognizing that freight hauling was a viable growth industry for the future. And they were also far ahead in recognizing and seizing the opportunity for expansion in Asia. Mike Overstreet accompanied me on two trade missions to Asia in order to look at exciting business opportunities. That is why I was not surprised when Corporate Air was recently recognized with the Regional Airlines Teamwork Award by the Professional Pilots Association. This award is testament to teamwork and a cando attitude that describes Montanans in general and the Overstreets in particular. Corporate Air and Montana understand that teamwork can solve almost any problem. no matter how difficult. When founded in 1981. the economy in America and Montana was weak. Naysayers discounted the chances of a little Montana air service that did not carry passengers. Well. they were wrong. Through organization. vision. and hard work. the Overstreets and Corporate Air not only made it but are national and international leaders. Finally. Corporate Air is as committed to the Billings community as to success in business. They organized a successful Big Sky International Air Show. with an attendance of over 12.000 people. with the proceeds going to local charities. That is just one example of how Corporate Air and the Overstreet family strive daily to give back to the community that helped them grow. Their children. Luke and Sara. and their three wonderful grandchildren represent generations of hardworking Montanans who will continue Mike and Lindas work. To conclude. Mr. President. we in Montana are justifiably proud of this important award and Corporate Airs many contributions. The rest of America would do well to follow the example set by these innovative Montanans.9",

D.C. area. in the magazine American Enterprise published by the American Enterprise Institute. It is titled. \"Work not Welfare.\" For a long time we have known that Mormons have been exceptional in not having their people on welfare. But this article goes into more detail than I had known. If we try to get welfare reform without providing jobs for people. we will not have welfare reform. It is interesting to note in the article. he says. \"I quickly learned that the physical welfare of my charges was an important influence on their spiritual welfare.\" That is true in the religious sense and also in the nonreligious sense. I will have an amendment to try a WPAtype of demonstration in four different places in the country. I hope it can pass. The reality is there is simply no great demand for unskilled labor in the United States today. and most of the people on welfare fall in that category. If we were to do that. not only would we help the people more. as the LatterDay Saints do. but we would be moving on other social problems. We spend a great deal of time making speeches about crime and doing very little constructive about it. Show me an area with high unemployment. whether it is White. Black. or Hispanic. and I will show you an area of high crime. I ask that the Ralph Hardy piece be printed in the RECORD and I urge my colleagues to read it.",

St. Brendans quickly became a model of educational excellence nationwide. In 1990. St. Brendans was selected as a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education for its academic excellence and commitment to parent involvement. St. Brendans has received much praise over the years for Its abilily to meet the needs of a economically and racially diverse student body.

It restores $43 billion in cuts over the next 7 years in the earned income tax credit in the Senate Republican reconciliation bill. At a time when many working Americans are struggling to make ends meet. the Senate Republican budget would hike Federal taxes on low- and moderateincome working families. It would also raise some State taxes on these same working families. This is a double whammy on working families. This Federal tax increase will also raise taxes in seven States that have a State earned income tax credit tied to the Federal credit. Including my home State of Vermont. This bill will raise both State and Federal taxes on 27.000 Vermont working families earning less than $28.500 a year. As a result of this double tax jeopardy. working Vermonters will lose $64 million in Federal earned income tax credit benefits and an additional $16 million in State earned income tax credit benefits over the next 7 years. On average. about 63 percent of Vermont taxpayers would see their taxes rise under this bill because of these earned income tax credit cuts. Under the Senate bill. a Vermont family of four earning $15.610 a year. the 1995 poverty line. would lose $4.500 of earned income tax credit benefits over the next 7 years3.600 cut in the Federal earned income tax credit and $900 cut in the State earned income tax credit. A Vermont family of four making $22.000 a year would fare even worsesuffering a loss of $1.208 in State earned income tax credit and a loss of $4.831 in Federal earned income tax credit over the next 7 years. It is very doubtful that the Vermont General Assembly can afford to increase the State earned income tax credit to make up this loss. with even more Federal cuts on the way. Workers are treading water or worse against the rising tide of inflation and low wages. Now is not the time to cut a tax credit that will raise Federal and State taxes on low- and moderateincome families. Instead. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to restore the earned income tax credit.",

The purpose of the earned income credit was to offset income taxes that working families payworking peopleand Social Security taxes that working families pay. and excise taxes that working families pay. That is the purpose of it. The other side has said this proposal that they have offered does not increase income taxes on 98 percent of the people. What about Social Security taxes? What about excise taxes? Are they saying those are not taxes? Are they not saying that a working family at the end of the month has less money in their pockets because they paid those taxes? A working family has less in their pockets after this proposal passes because of the Social Security taxes that they do not have offset. and the excise taxes that they do not have offset. And if you are a working single person. forget it. You are going to have a serious increase in taxes. Those are the facts. Those are the facts. One repeat of a statistic: Of the $114 billion in Federal taxes paid by families and individuals earning under $30.000 a year. only $12 billion of the $114 billion are income taxes. We offset all the others. They offset only the $12 billion. In the context of a tax bill. where an estate of $5 million gets a tax cut of $1.7 million. I really want to hear the other side defend that estate tax provision. I want to hear them make the argument about the family farm because I will have an amendment later that will protect the family farm. and it will cost $700 million as opposed to $3 billion over 5 years. Then we will be able to see the difference between the two parties. Even on that issue. one wants to protect the family farm. and the other. of course. wants to give a little bit more benefit to business corporations. and not only the family farm. I can understand why that is good politics for some. It certainly is not good politics.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to introduce legislation. H.R. 1339. that would provide Medicaid coverage for all certified nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists for services they are legally authorIzed to perform. As the need to provide basic medical care to the Nations medically deprived population Increases. the need to facilitate access to quality. costeffective primary care provided by nurse practitioners also increases. Over 400 studies have confirmed the high quality of health care provided by nurse practitioners in a variety of urban and rural primary care settings. It is well known that the majority of our underserved populations are located in rural and inner city settings across the Nation. While nurse practitioners are willing and able to provide services in these settings. not all nurse practitioners are currently being reimbursed by Medicaid for their services In these areas. Currently. patients are able to access the care of certain nurse practitioners such as family and pediatric nurse practitioners. but others such as adult and womens health nurse practitioners are not accessible. The legislation I am introducing would enable all nurse practitioners. regardless of specialty. to provide care to Medicaid recipients. Nurse practitioners are particularly capable to provide health care to the indigent. Their educational programs emphasize the provision of care to patients who have limited financial resources. In a national survey conducted by the American Academy on Nurse Practitioners. over 60 percent of the patients seen by these providers had family incomes of less than $16.000 per year. Nurse practitioners rate as high in financial efficiency as they do in consumer satisfaction. Their ability to focus on preventative and curative medical services contribute to the quality as well as the costeffectiveness of the care they provide. Nurse practitioners can play a central role in achieving our national goal of providing quality. costefficient health care for all citizens. I am hopeful this legislation will help to eliminate disparities in access to care for rural and inner city Medicaid populations by providing direct reimbursement to nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists who have proven their ability to deliver quality care in a costeffective manner.",

I wish to call the attention of our colleagues to the annual commemoration of Public Service Recognition Week and to one activity that has occurred and another that will begin on The Mall here in Washington tomorrow. For the past 10 years. the Presidents Council on Management Improvement. and the Public Employees Roundtable. launch activities in more than 1.000 cities which highlight excellence In public service at the Federal. State. and local govemment levels. The objectives are to Inform Americans about the contributions of public employees to the quality of our lives. to encourage excellence In government. and to promote public service careers. Yesterday. the Public Employees Roundtable held a ceremony here on Capitol Hill. and resented its Breakfast of Champions Award to representatives of exceptional programs at each level of government. Among the winners was the Illinois Department of transportation which was recognized for the innovative Chicago Freeway Traffic and Incident Management Program. Beginning tomorrow. May 4. and continuing through Sunday. May 7. over two dozen Federal agencies and employee organizations will have exhibits set up in three large tents on The Mall. The public is invited to come out to learn more about the functions and services each provides. Some of our military bands and other groups will provide entertainment for this family oriented event. Mr. Speaker. Public Service Recognition Week offers all Americans. especially young people. the opportunity to learn more about the government and the rewarding careers available. It also provides the opportunity to thank those who serve us daily for their efforts. I believe that our public service should be valued and respected. and the adtivities oocurring this week make crystal clear why.",

We will long remember these civil servants who paid the highest price for their commitment to public service. One such dedicated public servant killed in the bomb blast was Secret Service agent Alan Whicher. Agent Whicher was a native of Maryland and lived In the town of Rockville. MD. until last October when he was transferred to Oklahoma City. While he was In Washington. Alan Whicher was assigned to protect the President. The transfer to Americas heartland was viewed as a safer and less hectic assignment. Alan Whicher was brought back home to Maryland to be buried. A wake was held at St. Patricks Catholic Church in Rockville. where he stopped each morning before he went to work. Former neighbors. relatives. and colleagues poured into the church to pay their last respects. President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended the funeral. Alan Whicher was described by his former neighbors and friends as a man who cared deeply about his community. He was a loving husband to his wife. Pamela. and he was a devoted father to his three children. One of his last acts was to call his wife. who was about to give a speech at their new church. to offer encouragement and to wish her well. Alan Whicher was a hero. All of the Federal employees who died In the ugly bomb blast In Oklahoma City were heroes. They were Americans who worked hard In unglamorous jobs to improve the quality of life for others. They were men and women who upheld the virtues of thrift and hard work to achieve economic independence. Their lives will not have been In vain If we can translate what happened in Oklahoma City into something that brings the whole country together.",

Not only are the costs of my amendments fully offset. but I know my colleagues will agree that because these two projects are already underway and because they represent an integral part of the training of our troops. continued funding is both appropriate and necessary. This Congress has already invested $14.5 million Into phase one of Fort Campbells Education Center. Funding for the final phase. phase two. will provide additional needed classrooms. office space. and additional parking. As many of you may know. Fort Campbell has the largest educational program of any divisionlevel installation in Forces Command. Funding for this last phase will assure we can take a stateoftheart education program out of World War Uera buildings. In addition. this Congress has dedicated funds to the first two phases of the Western Kentucky Training Site for a total of SI1.l million. Because this is a fivephase project. providing funding for phase three is critical to keeping this project on time and on track for completion. The Western Kentucky training facility. in conjunction with the hightechnology training available at Fort Knox. puts Kentucky at the forefront of this countrys military training.

Development of the corpslevel surface to air theater missile defense system. called the Medium Extended Air Defense System [MEADS) is adversely affected by the current legislation. Unless the corrections. which I will describe in a moment. are made. the current provisions will likely halt the development of this important program. First. let me address the necessity for MEADS. There are currently under development a number of theater missile defense systems. However. no system. except for MEADS. protects frontline troops in the corps maneuver area. Hence. MEADS will fulfill an existing. urgent U.S. operational requirement for a rapidly deployable. highly mobile. robust air defense system designed to protect maneuver forces and expeditionary forces of the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. Both services are in strong agreement on the need for protection against short- to mediumrange ballistic missiles and the full spectrum of airbreathing threatsaircraft. cruise missiles. and unmanned aerial vehicles. The urgency of the need for MEADS is testified to by the support of the Commandersin Chief of Central Command. Atlantic Command. Korean Command and of course. the European Command/NATO. These operational commanders. as well as. the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Staff of the Army are all on the record documenting the urgency of the requirement for this system. It should be noted that this operational need will only become greater with time. Estimates of future threats include the increasing ability of both major and lesser powers. as well as. substate actors. to acquire and utilize the rapidly accessible and increasingly affordable ballistic and cruise missile technologies against our forward deployed units. The operational need for MEADS has been made clear by our allies. In addition to our partnership with Germany and Italy. in developing a theater missile defense system. for forward deployed. mobile forces. other nations have expressed a strong interest in purchasing such a system to meet their own security requirements. I must repeat this most essential point: no other planned theater missile defense system can satisfy operational requirements with respect to defending soldiers and marines deployed in the forward area of the theater.",

    "speech": "I am concerned that section 107 of this bill. which lifts the cap on the amount of funds that may be expended on a customs service program for small airports. could lead to abuse of this program and unfair competition. Under current law. all large airports. such as Bangor International Airport. which are designated ports of entry. must charge passengers $6.50 per ticket to pay for the cost of customs inspection and processing. In 1984. Congress established a program for small airports that could not qualify for portofentry status to enable them to provide customs services to international passengers. Passengers arriving at airports that qualify for this program do not pay the $6.50 fee. Instead. a userfee airport pays a user fee directly to the Customs Service. which goes into an account that pays the salaries of the customs inspector and the cost of customs inspections and other services at the user fee airport. By law. the Secretary of the Treasury may only qualify an airport to participate in this userfee program upon finding that the volume or value of business cleared through such airport is insufficient to justify the availability of customs services at such airport. Guidelines published by the Customs Service provide that airports with over 15.000 international passengers annually. or which meet other criteria. can qualify for portofentry status. By implication. airports receiving more than 15.000 passengers annually should not qualify for the userfee program because they have sufficient volume to justify fulltime customs services. Unfortunately. there is no mechanism under current law for automatic graduation of userfee airports into portofentry status. This loophole enables airports designated by the Secretary as a userfee airport to service substantial numbers of international passengers. but circumvent the $6.50 per passenger fee that must be paid by passengers arriving at portofentry airports. Unless the law is changed. airports with userfee status. that nonetheless enter the business of largescale international transit. have a builtin competitive advantage over portofentry airports that must charge each passenger $6.50. I would like to ask the Chairman of the Finance Committee for his comments on this situation.",

We need to ensure that the advantages of the userfee program benefit the small airports it is designed to help and not give an unfair and unintended advantage to big airports that remain in the program. Therefore. I think we need to find a way to discourage user fee airports that have a substantial increase in the number of international passengers from remaining in the userfee program and to encourage their designation as a port of entry. which is appropriate for larger airports. Otherwise. a user fee airport could receive an unfair competitive advantage over portofentry airports merely by avoiding the $6.50 passenger processing fee on airline tickets. as the Senator from Maine has pointed out.",

As the chairman may be aware. this is a critical issue for the State of Maine. as abuse of the userfee program by airports that no longer qualify for that program have the potential of causing severe economic harm to Bangor International Airport. one of Maines most important employers. If this abuse of the program is permitted to continue. flights that currently refuel and clear Customs in Bangor could decide to move their refueling operations to Canada. where the Government heavily subsidizes fuel costs at competing transit airports. Those flights could then continue on to Sanford Airport in Florida. a userfee airport that has been able to gain an unfair competitive advantage because it can offer to international charter flights the ability to avoid the $6.50perpassenger fee that must be paid by portofentry airports such as Bangor. Indeed. there can be little doubt that this diversion of air traffic will occur. as. according to press reports. Sanford Airport is scheduled to receive 325.000 passengers during the remainder of the year. a level far above the 15.000passenger threshold for userfee airports. I am very concerned that the expansion of the userfee program. made possible by the lifting of the funding cap in this appropriations bill. will create an immediate threat to Bangor International Airports business and have the unintended effect of diverting to a Canadian airport important international air traffic that currently uses American transit airport facilities. Can the chairman of the Finance Committee provide assurances that this problem will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible and that he will support a legislative remedy to close the loophole that currently provides userfee airports engaged in substantial international business to circumvent the $6.50 per passenger fee?",

I have introduced legislation to ban the production and sale of junk gunsor as they are sometimes called. Saturday night specials. My bill would take the standards for safety and reliability that are currently applied to imported handguns. and apply them to domestically produced firearms. It is a simple common sense proposal that deserves the support of all Senators. I had a meeting with a very special physician today and I want to share with my colleagues some of the things that I learned. Dr. Andrew McGuire is Director of the Trauma Foundation. a nonprofit organization based out of San Francisco General Hospital. The Trauma Foundation has a simple goal: keep people out of the emergency room. Several years ago. Dr. McGuire was asked to write a policy paper aimed at developing strategies to curtail violence in the San Francisco area. He concluded that something had to be done to curtail the proliferation of handguns. Specifically. he advised banning these cheap. poorly constructed junk guns. Since then. Dr. McGuire has been on a crusade to educate the country about the danger of junk guns. He has developed a national network of trauma surgeons to spread the word about gun violence. On this issue. we should listen to our doctors. They are the ones who see the destruction caused by these weapons first hand. Some of the statistics Dr. McGuire shared with me were truly frightening. Since 1930when statistics were first recordedmore than 1.3 million American have died of gunshots. That is more Americans than died in all of our wars since the Civil War. Two weeks ago. the Childrens Defense Fund released a study showing that nationwide gunshots were the second leading cause of death among children. In California. gunshots are No. 1. Let me say that again. Among California children ages 0 to 19. gunshots are the single leading cause of death. More die of gunshots than automobile accidents or any disease. That is a crisis that I. as a Senator from California. cannot overlook. We must do something to stop this epidemic of violence. Passing the Junk Gun Violence Protection Act. would be an excellent step.",

I was stunned because I had never been confident that I would be the first Republican in history to be elected to the U.S. Senate by the people of North Carolina. When I got over that. I made a commitment to myself that I would never fall to see a young person. or a group of young people. who wanted to see me. I have kept that commitment and it has proved enormously meaningful to me because I have been inspired by the estimated 60.000 young people with whom I have visited during the 23 years I have been in the Senate. A large percentage of them are greatly concerned about the total Federal debt which recently exceeded $5 trillion. Of course. Congress is responsible for creating this monstrous debt which coming generations will have to pay. Mr. President. the young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the U.S. Constitution. no President can spend a dime of Federal money that has not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate of the United States. That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on February 25. 1992. I decided that it was important that a daily record be made of the precise size of the Federal debt which. at the close of business yesterday. Wednesday. April 24. stood at $5.110.704.059.629.39. This amounts to $19.307.33 for every man. woman. and child in America on a per capita basis. The increase in the national debt since my report yesterdaywhich identified the total Federal debt as of close of business on Tuesday. April 23. 1996shows an increase of more than 4 billion dollars4.331.633.680.00. to be exact.

The vote is further evidence of sea change in Palestinian attitudes and ideology. and provided a welcome respite from the otherwise troubling situation in the Middle East. In September 1993. during the signing of the historic IsraelPLO Declaration of Principles. PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat made a commitment to Israel to amend the Charterthe spirit and letter of which was clearly at odds with the peace agreement. Yesterday. Arafat. who Is now Chairman of the autonomous Palestinian Authority. secured nearuniversal Palestinian backing for his pledge. In voting to carry out this commitment. the Palestinians remain eligible under the terms of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act. also known as MEPFA. to receive United States assistance. The vote also appears to open the way for the resumption of substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestnians leading to a final status agreement. As one of the original authors of MEPFA. I was particularly pleased by yesterdays events. In February. I led a congressional delegation to the Middle East. where the distinguished Senator from Virginia [Senator ROBB). the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma [Senator INHOFE]. and I met with Chairman Arafat to urge that the Charter be amended. While I was somewhat skeptical after that meeting that Chairman Arafat would deliver on his promise. yesterdays vote helps to convince me that there is a forceful and sincere desire on his part to implement the peace agreements with Israel. To be sure. Mr. President. there remains much concern about the future of IsraeliPalestinian relations. The issue of terrorism remains the most important factor in determining the success or failure of the peace process. We can. and should. continue to press the Palestinians to root out completely the terrorist elementwhich they will only be able to do with the support and good will of Israel. The vote yesterday. in my opinion. will do much to bolster Arafats standing in Israels eyes. And that bodes well for the future.",

There is a carveout in this legislation. carving out securities fraud from the application of the civil RICO statutes. I think that is a bad idea. But I will not debate that issue tonight. I have an amendment that is before the body that says such a carveout exists. except that it shall not apply if any participant in fraud is criminally convicted. then RICO can apply. and the statute does not begin to toll until the day of the conviction becomes final. Keeping with the admonition of Russell Long. I have no further comment on the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I send this amendment on behalf of myself and Mr. BRYAN. It is a very simple amendment. The present bill. as it is pending before the Senate. calls for a mandatory review by the court in any private action arising under the legislation. It says that the court shall establish a record with specific findings regarding compliance by each party. and each attorney representing any party with the requirements of rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. prohibiting frivolous pleading or frivolous activity by counsel. The difficulty is that later in the bill where it specifies presumption. that we call for on page 105 and 107 of the bill. we only specify that the appropriate sanction apply to pleadings filed by the plaintiffs. Our amendment would change that and make it more balanced. in that it would specify that the sanctions could apply either to pleadings filed by the plaintiff or to responsive pleadings or motions filed by defense. I think this is acceptable to the managers of the bill. I think It is only reasonable that if we are going to have this provision in the billwhich is a provision. quite frankly. I do not agree withI think that singling out these securities cases as the only cases in our court system where we require a mandatory review by the court. and the finding and imposition of specific findings. is a mistake. If we are going to have it. we should make it balanced between plaintiff and defendant. I know the Senator from Nevada wishes to speak. I yield the floor.",

The court shall promptly decide with written findings of fact and conclusions of law whether to impose sanctions under rule 11. and upon the adjudication. the district court shall include the conclusions and shall impose the sanctions which the court in the courts discretion finds appropriate. Mr. President. I submit to my colleagues that leaving the discretion to the judge really is the right way to handle these matters. These judges sit on these cases. know the cases. and have ample authority as a discretionary matter to impose the sanction.

This legislation would provide direct Medicaid reimbursement to nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists for services they provide within their scope of practice. regardless of whether these services are performed under the supervision of a physician. With the current shortage of primary health care services in our Nation. millions of Americans are without essential health services. Medicaid recipients are particularly vulnerable. By allowing direct Medicaid reimbursement to nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists. I believe that this legislation will not only improve access to much needed health care services. but will strengthen our health care delivery system. A number of recent studies have documented the important roles that nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists play in providing costeffective. quality health care services. For example. a December 1986 study by the Office of Technology Assessment detailed the significant contributions nurse practitioners have made in reducing health care costs. improving the quality of care. and increasing the accessibility of services.

My larger consideration here today is that if you wanted to relieve the number of people that are in prison so that you could keep the violent offenders. how about overcrowded State prisons that had releases that would not occur if we had boot camps. drug courts and prevention programs that were keeping minor offenders and young people from taking up all of this space? We have the largest and most infamous lockup rates in the world in this country. In the inner cities of the United States. it is 3.000 people per 100.000 that are in prison. So there are no circumstances that I w.ll ever advocate building more prisons to lock up more people. I would advocate. however. building more prisons to contain violent offenders and support the block grant program as opposed to a program that the States clearly will never qualify for. It is in that spirit and that limited spirit only that I support a block grant program. It is not that I have just converted or changed my position incredibly for the purposes of this debate. The fact of the matter is there is flexibility in block grant programs in this bill and the one we consider next that allows for boot camps. allows for drug courts. allows for prevention programs. and. yes. allows for night basketball.",

I think this is an important issue. The lawyers here may argue the nuances of the legislation. but I would like to address this bill on peoples terms for a minute.

It sends exactly the message that the contract is supposed to be spreading: Let us give States and cities flexibility to deal with their problems. It creates one block grant with maximum flexibility. It also corrects a mistake I believe we made last yearit removes the match requirement which has caused many local governments to say no to Federal crime money because they just cannot afford it. If we really want to move forward we would be continuing the progress we made last year. Let us build more prisonsbut let us do it in the right way. Let us keep the right balance between prevention and punishment. One of the things the voters said to us last November was. \"Listen to us.\" Let us listen to our constituents. our cops. and our mayors. Support the Schumer amendment.",

Mr. Chairman. some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are having some difficulty determining how truth in sentencing would apply to a 30.000year term. It reminds me of the judge who sentenced a defendant to serve 100 years. The defendant said. \"But. Judge. I will never live that long.\" The judge said. \"Well. you just do the best you can.\" It is quite clear that a 30.000year sentence would result in a life term for a prisoner. What this is about is gutting truth in sentencing. What this is about is prisoners who are sentenced ostensibly to 20 years who serve 3 years. The public does not want this. their Representatives in Congress do not want this. That is why I believe this amendment will fail.",

I met a young activist named Mark Segal when I was a Republican member of the Philadelphia City Council many years ago. When Mark started the newspaper in 1975. he was a pioneer. In 1975. very few communities had any means for gays and lesbians to know about what was going on in terms of politics. government. health or social events. They had to depend on leaflets and word of mouth. Through the energy of people like Mark Segal throughout the country. that has changed. Lesbian and gay journalism helped that community become more cohesive. politically aware and active. Indeed. trailblazers like Mark Segal helped put the community in the gay and lesbian community. Now. Mark is respected as an elder statesman in gay and lesbian Independent journalism in America. though he is anything but an elder. Nationally. Mark was deeply involved in the establishment of gay and lesbian journalists and publishers organizations. as well as putting some of their newspapers onto the intemet Through credible and independent journalism. the Philadelphia Gay News promoted pride in gay and lesbian self Identity and educated the community about violence and HIV.

This Is a small step toward providing American farmers with the regulatory relief that will enable them to compete In a very competitive global environment. Many of my colleagues have seen the Agriculture Policy Ledger. The Agriculture Committee has told farmers that there will be less money in the future but In return we have also promised less Government Involvement In their lives. The Contract With America contained many of those promises. The Clean Water Act adopted by this House and awaiting action in the Senate would go a long way in addressing a wetlands regulatory nightmare. I am firmly committed that we should consider many of the policy issues impacting farmers in a calm and careful manner. This bill will lay the cornerstone for the Agriculture Commlttees*effort to provide some regulatory relief to producers in the agricultural policy area. This bill reflects our commitment to a twotrack approach. The first track. the Agricultural Market Transition Act. contains the major spending items in the agriculture budget. The second track. the one that we are embarking on today. deals with many of the polIcy issues under the House Agriculture Committees jurisdiction. I firmly believe rolling all of the budget and policy issues into one huge farm bill is a mistake. The Senate chose to pursue this approach and in that process ended up spending at least $800 million above the December CBO baseline. In fact. when you compare the Agriculture Market Transition Act to the Senate bill. we save over $5.4 billion more than they do.",

Mr. Speaker. when the 1986 defense authorization bill was enrolled. it was enrolled with a typographical error. in that it made reference to an accompanying section as section 8803(A). when it should have made reference to 8803(A)(1). This bill simply corrects that typographical error. So if we can get it enacted and signed by the President. the school districts which were supposed to and intended to receive those funds pursuant to the correctly enrolled and passed bill will be able to receive them. It is purely correcting a typographical error. but a very significant one to the school districts affected.",

We are a stronger Nation because of his service. I simply wanted to say in my 6 years in the Congress. probably one of the greater privileges I have had has been to work with the gentleman from Virginia to fight for the impact aid program. It seems to me. Mr. Speaker. that along with our Nations veterans. there could be few groups more deserving in America than the children of military families. children who often have to go to school not knowing whether their mother or father will even be alive at their graduation. children who Christmas after Christmas or season after season have to be with only one part of their family. because the father or mother is serving their country thousands of miles away. While I am sorry there were some in Washington from both parties last year who wanted to cut impact aid for these deserving military children. people such as Mr. BATEMAN saw the importance and the value of this program. It not only provides the support for a quality education for military children they deeply deserve. it also is a matter of maintaining quality people in our military. because with an allvolunteer force how can we expect the best and brightest to come into our Armed Forces if we cannot assure them that their children will receive a quality education? So my thanks once again goes out to the gentleman from Virginia . who at one point last year very briefly after a momentary health problem. even at some risk to his own health. came to this floor to see that the impact aid program would stay alive. and for that not only I but. far more importantly. millions of American children this year and generations ahead will be in his debt.",

The bill represents a major. bipartisan effort to respond to the national methamphetamine crisis confronting our nation today. The bill passed by a vote of 386 to 34. H.R. 3852 is nearly identical to S. 1965. which was passed by the Senate nearly two weeks ago. It was introduced by Senate Judiciary Chairman HATCH and a large. bipartisan group of Senators. including Senators BIDEN. DASCHLE and FEINSTEIN. The principal difference between the two bills is that the Senate bill lacks the mandatory minimum sentences for methamphetamine trafficking. Like the House bill. S. 1965 has the support of both the pharmaceutical industry and the Drug Enforcement Administration. I must say. and I think I speak for the entire law enforcement community when I say. I am disappointed that the Senate did not pass our tougher bill. I am disappointed that those few Members in the other body who opposed the mandatory minimum sentences in our bill did not drop their opposition. And. I am disappointed that the President. who says he supports the mandatory minimums in the House bill. did not call those Members. who are in his own party. and ask them to support these muchneeded penalties. Nevertheless. this is still a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a vitally important effort that has been worked on by Members of both Houses and both parties.

However. the end of this Congress will bring about the end of the distinguished service rendered to this body. and to this nation. by my dear friend and colleagueBILL ZELIFF. Elected in 1990. in only his second term Bill put his name on an amazing proposal--the \"A to Z\" plan. Zeliff was the \"Z\" in this planan idea to hold a week long marathon session devoted solely to debating spending cuts. Although this plan did not make it to the floor. it did set the stage for the remarkable record of holding down the growth in spending accomplished in this Congress. Although at the end of the alphabet. BILL ZELIFF was a leader in our efforts to balance the budget. However. BILL never limited himself to just one issue. With all of the problems we face in this Nation. BILL was always willing to take on another assignment. He demonstrated his leadership through the Whip organization as well as his skills in working with BILL MCCOLLUM on the Waco hearings. He did a superb job. His efforts to combat the scourge of drugs has also been outstanding. No matter how tough the issue. BILL was willing to meet it head on. It was only natural that BILL and I would become friends. We shared many of the same concerns and a common background. We were smallbusiness owners before coming to Congress. both of us as innkeepers. Through this mutual background we learned how Government can become a burden on businessesthe paperwork. regulations. and taxes. We both embarked on campaigns for Congress. to change the way Washington works. My personal esteem is so great for BILL. that he became my roommate. I will miss the time we spent together discussing the issues of the day. I would also point out that as former hotel owners. we kept the place spotless. I know that BILL looks forward to spending more time with his familySydna and your three childrenbut you will leave a hole here in Congress that will be hard to fill.

Once into a computer system. hackers have the ability to steal. modify. or destroy sensitive data. thus the potential cost to users. including businesses. are staggering. That is why the Justice Department and the FBI support this important legislation. It will help stem the online crime epidemic and increase protection for both government and private computers. The bill would allow Federal prosecution for those who misuses computers to obtain government information and. where appropriate. information held by the private sector. The bill would also penalize any person who uses a computer to cause the transmission of a computer virus or other harmful computer program to government and financial institution computers not used in interstate communications. such as intrastate local area networks used by government agencies.

It is a matter on which we are seeking the advice of many people in this country as to how it would affect the pension systems not only of our governmental employees but also of those in the private sector. As I have said to the two Senators. whatever we do in this area has generally been followed in the private sector after we have taken a new course with regard to pensions. I have committed to the Senators. I am pleased to say. Senator GREGG. who is the principal sponsor. and Senator REID. cosponsor of the bill. that we will have a hearing and we will get the opinions of these people as quickly as possible. If we can get to the place where we can reach a conclusion in time to consider it at the time the legislative appropriations bill comes up. I will be pleased to assist in that regard.

I am thinking of widows and spouses of those who might be incarcerated and how it is going to happen that we follow this process and what happens to the economy if they do not have the money they have earned in the past through the retirement systems. So I commit that we will hold that hearing as quickly as possible when we come back and work with them. I do applaud what they are doing. I do not disagree.

As a result. the Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety was created. This is a private. nonprofit. selfsustaining entity.

We are keeping the GATT language as it relates to the term \"substantial investment.\" This is simply what we are trying to do with the PryorBrownChafee substitute amendment at this time. We are trying to basically reinforce what we already have built into the GATT treaty. adopt that language. and apply to the drug companies the exact same rules and definitional standards that we apply to every other industry in our country and in our world today who are signatories to the GATT. I want to make a couple of more points. The Senator from Pennsylvania has mentioned that we needed 70 days in order to resolve all of this. What the Senator from Pennsylvania must be aware of. and what the Senator from Arkansas is aware of. is that every day that goes by these companies are getting. in my opinion. egregious windfalls totaling $5 million extra every day that we estimate could be used to purchase cheaper or less expensive generic drugs. What this is about. Mr. President. really is about a few drug companies. For example. here is Zantac. If we had a generic substitute today for Zantac. we would be paying about 40 percent or 50 percent less than we are paying with the brand name Zantac today in our drugstores. Mr. President. this is an absurd situation. It Is time for us to correct this. We hope that the Senate will avail itself of this opportunity.

Had we had in effect a procedure. which I am suggesting. for a maximum 7month determination regarding companies that the Senator from Arkansas refers to. we could have had a judicial determination made on or about January 1. 1996. It could have already been made. This legislation is really not the best way to solve the problem. There is a question as to what will happen in conference on this Department of Defense authorization bill. and whether the amendment will be adopted in the first place. There is also a question of whether the President will veto this Department of Defense authorization bill because it has substantially more spending than he is prepared to accept. But. if the parties agree to a procedure where there was expedited judicial determination as to what is a substantial investment. we could have generic products on the market within 7 months. If my colleague from Arkansas would engage in a brief discussionit has to be brief because I do not have too much time leftwhat would the problem be with the generic companies that the Senator from Arkansas refers to to accept the procedure where there would be a court determination made within 7 months as to whether they had made a substantial investment. Then. if the court finds in their favor. they could sell the generic drug plus recover full damages for the period from the time that they could not sell the generic drug until the time the court determined there was substantial investment and they could sell the generic drug?",

This matter has been pending now for more than a yearsince May 25. 1995. If the parties really wanted to resolve this. we could come to terms on expedited judicial proceedings which Senator HATCH is prepared to accept. That would take. of course. a maximum of 7 months. Then the generic company would have a determination of substantial investment. and they would be in the field. In addition. they would be entitled to collect their damages in the interim. I believe. as a matter of fairness. that we ought to get the judicial determinations as promptly as possible. But we also need to have fair protection for the substantial investments made by the pharmaceutical pioneer companies. This expedited procedure would ensure justice for all parties. and I submit that we ought to proceed forward with it. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor a leader who provided both a bedrock of stability and a progressive vision for the community in which he served. After 16 years at city hall. Mayor Sam Halloin of Green Bay. WI. will leave office to begin a wellearned retirement. When Sam steps down this spring as the citys longestserving mayor. the citizens of Green Bay will remember him as both a skilled political tactician and as a scupitor who shaped the city of Green Bay for nearly a generation. As the guide of a changing city. it has been said that Sam tied all the loose ends together both in the community and in city council chambers. where he often encountered disagreement but never turned down an opportunity to listen to anothers point of view. From the beginning of his political career. Sam dedicated himself to considering all sides of an argument. announcing in his bid for the mayors office: \"I do not have the answers to all the problems that face us. but I will work actively for an honest government that will be responsible and objective in its service to the public.\" Apparently. that was exactly what the people of Green Bay were looking for. They elected him to lead their city in 1979. defeating former mayor Thomas Atkinson. Sams political career began in 1962 when he was first elected to city council. In 1974 he was elected city council president and served for two terms. He also served two terms as Brown County board chairman before announcing his candidacy for mayor in 1978. In each of his successive mayoral terms. Sam Halloin added to a list of accomplishments with wideranging benefits to the city and people of Green Bay. His successful completion of city projects such as the Old Fort Square development. East Town Mall and the industrial park created jobs and provided a boost to the local economy while many cities suffered through a recession. Mayor Halloin helped transform Green Bay into an even more popular tourism and business destination with the construction of the Embassy Suites and Regency Conference Center. He also was successful in negotiating the construction of a $6 million State office building in downtown Green Bay. drawing hundreds of workers into the downtown area and creating a positive ripple effect in the local economy.",

A Johnston was not the type of a man to sit back and let the world go by. he took action to make his community a better place to live. During the 1930s. he took his property and gave it to the less fortunate by converting an old car Into a soup kitchen In Logan Heights. Later. he provided guidance and Inspiration for many teens in the community by founding \"Los Gallos.\" a club for restless teens. He led voter registration drives. He was committed to making a difference in the lives of many In the Latino community in San Diego. He is the type of leader we should all try to emulate. Mr. Johnston was a proud leader of the spirit and soul of the barrio. He was adamant In his opposition to junkyards and pollution producing Industries In Logan Heights. In the 1970s. he led the campaigns for the conversion of most of a 5.4acre parcel at the foot of Crosby Street into a bayfront addition to Chicano Park. a cultural landmark. He was one voice who made a difference. My community has lost a great leader. and faithful fighter in the ongoing struggle to Improve the quality of life for ourselves and our children. It is now up to us to continue his work and his dedication to the community. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. with regards to the Kassebaum amendment concerning striker replacement Issues and the Executive order to which it pertains. I oppose the amendment. When this issue has arisen in the past I have supported substantial modifications to the stxiker replacement bill. including mandatory arbitration. These modifications would have substantially reduced strikes. Given my reservations. I have spent a good deal -of time studying the Executive order. It is important to note that the provisions established by this order are much narrower in scope than striker replacement proposals made in the past and very limited in the number of businesses that would be affected. From the outset and before I go any further. let me point out that the Kassebaum amendment violates the rules of the Senate which prohibit legislating on an appropriations bill. The procedure in the Senate is to pass legislative authorization or prohibition legislation and to deal with the matter of appropriations separately. The Kassebaum amendment clearly violates these rules. Next. the underlying issue before the Senate is a supplemental defense appropriations bill. I do not think that bill ought to be jeopardized by a nongermane issue that can be brought up through the regular legislative process. In reference to the Executive order. there are two points that I think should be made. The first is that the order in question does not require that Federal contractors who permanently replace workers be barred from holding contracts with the Federal Government. The order only gives the Secretary of Labor permission to consider terminating contracts with companies who permanently fire lawfully striking employees. Even if the Secretary does decide to terminate the contractor on this basis. it takes only an objection from the head of the involved Government agency to have the contract reinstated. There is also the issue of cost to the Government and ultimately to the taxpayers. We should realize that it is expensive for companies to hire replacement workers. For a business to change employees quickly costs a great deal bf money. Considering how often we have seen some companies overcharge the Government in the past. it is completely reasonable to expect that the costs of hiring these replacement workers will be passed on to the Government and ultimately the taxpayers.",

That is the effect of their amendment. This amendment is counterproductive. We need more organized labor. not less. to compete in international markets. We are the most productive country in the world. and it is because we have had good labormanagement relations working together. to increase productivity on the world market. Unions boosted productivity from 17 to 22 percent in construction. and a study of 20 manufacturing industries showed that unionized workers were from onefifth to nearly onequarter more productive than their nonunion counterparts. When I hear the statements coming from the other side of the aisleand what I hear is. \"Lets break down this labormanagement relations we have had. lets break down collective bargaining\"-the next thing I expect to hear is. \"Lets reintroduce child labor. if you want to compete with other countries that employ child labor.\" Well. why not? Workers have no more rights in this country. Workers have no rights to stick up for their dignity. to demand better wages. hours. and conditions of employment.

I heard my colleague make the statement. \"Well. the people who are pushing this amendment are just against organized labor.\" That Is not true. I think the people should have the right to organize. If people want to strike. if they do not want to work. they should have that right as well. Likewise. employers have to have the right to hire replacement workers. If they cannot do that. they cannot keep the doors open. In many cases. you might be a critical subassembly of a particular partthat has to happen to make this entire unit come together on time and on budget. and if an employer cannot hire replacement workers to make that happen. then they could be in violation of the original terms of that contract. They could lose the whole contract. The entire country. if you are talking about a Government contract. could end up paying an enormous amount for not being on time and. complying with the terms of the contract. This Is enormous power the President is trying to delegate to the Secretary of Labor. It is a mistake. Congress has refused to do this. Congress has refused to pass it. I believe correctly so.

President Clinton kicked off his 1996 reelection campaign by signing an Executive order that would prohibit Federal contractors from hiring permanent replacement workers during economic strikes. Despite all the talk about fostering fairness in the Federal workplace. the Executive order is a transparent effort on the Presidents part to shore up a political base that he believes is vital to his own reelection chances. During the past several years. Congress has considered. and repeatedly reJected. the socalled strikerreplacement bill.

It is the responsibility of Congress. not the administration. to write the laws governing labormanagement relations in this country. So. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this motion to invoke cloture. The amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Kansas.

We have seen time and time again that our Republican friends in this Congress want to propose to cut taxes for the wealthy and for special interests. It has been their No. 1 priority. The problem is that they keep running into a situation in which the commonsense budget rules require them to pay for any tax reductions that they provide. We saw last year how the Republicans would like to pay for those tax breaks. They wanted to cut Medicare. they wanted to cut education. they wanted to cut school lunches. the American people objected. And so now what are we back to? We are back to the resurrection of the David Stockman rosy scenario business. I would remind my colleagues what happened the last time the country used dynamic scoring. We were promised by David Stockman. who ran the budget office for President Reagan. that if we passed his magic budget which cut taxes and raised defense spending. we would cut our deficit from $55 billion to zero within 4 years. Instead. using his dynamic scoring. that deficit went up from $55 billion to $208 billion. and finally they shaved it a bit to $185 billion. I would simply suggest. if we were not paying for the added deficits that were added during those Reagan years. this budget would be in balance right now. That is the broblem. that is the problem. and this amendment will simply take us back to those good old rosy scenario days when we use phony estimates on revenue. and that allows us to spend more money on other things. We dare not do that if we want to remain fiscally responsible or even retain a pretension at fiscal responsibility.

A few months ago. when we were adopting. in fact about a month ago when we were adopting. the budget resolution. we were rightly criticized by Members and leadership on the other side of the aisle for allowing the deficit to go up. and as one of the freshmen who came here promising to do what we could to balance this budget. to balance the peoples budget. I was one who really felt we made a terrible mistake by allowing spending to go up more this year than we had agreed we would do just last year. and so. as a result. I and some of my freshmen colleagues sat down and said. well. what can we do? It is not enough just to vote no. We ought to have a constructive plan to help recover that fumble. By our calculations what really happened is we have allowed ourselves to agree to spending levels that are about $4.1 billion more than we agreed to last year in our 7year budget plan. What I am offering today is the same amendment that we have offered to virtually every appropriation bill since the adoption of the conference committee report on the budget resolution. and that is to reduce overall spending across the board 1.9 percent. Now. Mr. Chairman. that is less than one notch in a belt.

The fact is that this bill does cut 2.2 percent or $37.4 million already. We can pick up a pocket of change and say all we are talking about is 1 percent. 2 percent. 5 percent. 10 percent. it does not mean anything. When we look in terms of whether or not it is Library of Congress jobs. or jobs on the staff of your office or. in other bills it is Indian reservation jobs. or in other bills water project jobs. the fact is that we are talking about real and meaningful people who are going to be cut here. The question is. can we do the Job? Look. the U.S. Congress is paring down the discretionary budget in all 13 appropriations bills for the first time in modern times. We have saved 320 billion in fiscal year 1995. $23 billion in fiscal year 1996. and we are on the way to saving $15 billion to $20 billion in fiscal year 1997. If we look at where the President would have had us. if he had a Congress like he had 2 years ago. we are saving about $80 billion in the discretionary budget. I heard the argument of the gentleman from Oklahoma. He is not concerned about the discretionary budget. We are doing the job. The problem is in the mandatory side of the equation. We have not done the first thing on mandatory. That is the problem. If Members want to do something constructive for their constituents. go back and tell them how we can figure out how to save our citizens. to save our children and the economy of this country by restraining the mandatory spending of this Government. We are already doing the job here. For that reason. I urge the defeat of this amendment.",

Going across the board in addition is not the way to go. especially for this specific appropriation bill. because in this appropriation bill we have cut over 10 percent from the 1995 numbers.

We do not do that.

The gentleman alluded to the way in which this Congress continues to make changes. He of course is aware that at the beginning of the 104th Congress we cut franked mail by yet another onethird of the total amount and that we moved up the statutorily required 60day ban to a voluntary 90day ban. Once again I want to compliment the gentleman. His addition of a required statement that it is at taxpayer expense is a good. positive notifier of where the money is coming from. It also perhaps might be somewhat of a conscience conditioner in terms of whether you mail it out or not. and by giving it a separate report. we do move closer to the Senate. separating the response mail from the unsolicited mass mailing.

Admiral Straw will relinquish control of the Defense Logistics Agency. which is also known as the DLA. on the day he retires. He has served as Director of the DLA since DLA is the largest combat support agency in the Department of Defense. If it were a private company. it would be the 78th largest company in the Fortune 500. Admiral Straws performance in directing 50.000 civilian and military members. and in managing $14 billion in annual funding. has been recognized both inside the Department of Defense and in the private sector as a model of highly effective management. Under his leadership. DLA became one of the first Federal agencies ever to win a Ford Foundation Innovations in Government Award. During his tenure. Admiral Straw reengineered and completely revamped the DLA. His fine efforts have saved our $10 billion to date. and are expected to yield an additional $20 billion in savings and cost avoidance over the next 6 years while significantly improving responsiveness to customers. Admiral Straw began his military service in 1961 when he was commissioned upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy. He served numerous sea duty assignments and held senior policy positions within the Department of the Navy. These include Vice Commander. Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer of the Naval Supply Systems Command. and Director of Supply Policy and Programs on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations. In 1994. he organized and successfully conducted the Defense Performance Review. He will also receive the Society of Logistics Engineers annual Founders Award for 1996. later this year. Mr. President. our Nation owes Admiral Straw its appreciation for his truly distinguished service. I wish him and his wife. Chris. continued success and happiness in all future endeavors.",

I was always taught Government was our partner. I think some people have gotten confused and they now think it is our boss. Since 1954. the number of different penalties the IRS imposes on taxpayers has increased from 13 to 15013 to 150. In 1992. the IRS imposed 33 million penalties on taxpayers. The amount of penalties the IRS assesses has soared from a total of $1.3 billion In 1978 to $12.5 billion in 1992. You think we have a rage of criminality in our country? I think this is just absurd. The over 100 new penalties created in recent decades amounts to a deck of trump cards the Government can play against their own citizens. It is just totally inappropriate. Since 1980. the number of levies. the IRS seizures of bank accounts and paychecks. has increased fourfold. reaching 3.2 million in 1992. The U.S. General Accounting Office estimated in 1990 that the IRS imposes 50.000 incorrect and unjustified levies on citizens and businesses per year--50.000.

This is a bipartisan bill and it deserves broad bipartisan support. ENDA is necessary because gay men and lesbians face discrimination In hiring. promotions. and pay simply by virtue of their sexual orientation. Some States do offer protection to all the people who are victims of employment discrimination. Unfortunately. 41 States do not. So it seems to me this is a bill we should be proud to support as Republicans and as Democrats. The reach of ENDA Is modest. It exempts small business. religious Institutions. and the military and explicitly prohibits the adoption of quotas. It places the burden of proof entirely on the person claiming to be the victim of discrimination. I think it is quite instructive to note that ENDA has been endorsed by such blue chip companies as Apple Computer. AT&T. Bankers Trust. Bethlehem Steel. Eastman Kodak. Genentech. Merrill Lynch. Microsoft. Nynex. Pacific Gas & Electric. Pacific Telesis. Polaroid. Prudential Insurance. Quaker Oats. RJR Nabisco. Silicon Graphics. and Xerox.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. who makes some very valid points. One of them. essentially. is that it focuses on the crucial issue here. and that is whether or not law enforcement is a State and local function still. as it has always been in this country. or whether or not. basically. it is a matter for the Federal Government to attend to. given the Federal Governments wonderful track record in solving these problems historically. I think people realize. ultimately. that this money that flows down from on high to the State and local communities comes from their own pockets. It is not free money. I have often wondered how we got into a situation in this country where folks down where I grew up. in Lawrenceburg. TN. will get in their car and drive by the courthouse. to Nashville. past the State capital. and go out to the airport to get on a plane to fly to Washington. DC. and talk to me about how many cops they ought to have in Lawrenceburg. That is the situation we have gotten to in this country. While I do not think the conference report is the ultimate solution to this. I think more and more money ought to be left in the pockets of the people on the local level and let them solve the problems. It is certainly better than any alternative we have. The conference reports reflects what those of us who are new to this body were elected to do. Its provisions reflect the reality that there is not always a Washingtonbased solution to every problem. The Constitution limits the power of the Federal Government. Crimes. traditionally. in this country are not a national problem. with exceptions. but it is primarily a State and local problem. By eliminating the COPS Program. the conference report respects the proper role of the States and the people under our constitutional system.",

Senator BIDEN remarked that the process by which this bill was brought to the floor was problematic. I agree. the process was imperfect. I would rather have brought the authorizing language through the normal process. I would note. however. that we have already held more hearings on the authorizing language in this bill than the Judiciary Committee held on the entire 1994 crime bill. I think its tough to argue about the process by which this bill was sent to the floor. Second. I would like to address the socalled cuts to Federal law enforcement. Federal law enforcement is increased nearly 20 percent over 1995 levels. And I would note that since 1990. the only real cut to Federal law enforcement came in the Presidents first budget. Indeed. Congress actually restored the Presidents cuts. For example. the Commerce. Justice. State conference report funds INS at an increased rate of $2.557.470.000. The conference report provides over a 23.5percent increase of fiscal year 1995 enacted levels. This increase provides funds to better control our borders and to stem illegal immigration. The conference report provides funds for 800 new border patrol agents. 160 support personnel. and allows for better INS efficiency by redeploying interior agent positions to locations where the illegal immigration problem is most severe. the border. The report also increases. by 1.400 positions. personnel dedicated to apprehend. locate. detain. and deport illegal aliens. Funding is also provided for over 2.800 detention beds and funding for antismuggling units. Construction funds are provided for a triple fencing pilot project in southern California and funds to renovate a naval base for use as an INS satellite training facility. Although the FBI does not receive quite the funding that I would like it to. it nevertheless receives a substantial increase over 1995. The conference report represents over a 9.8percent increase compared to fiscal year 1995 enacted levels. This increase provides resources enabling the FBI to address many projects and initiatives. These initiatives include: Personnel to staff the FBI Command Cen-",

Justice and related agencies. I appreciate the diligent work of the respective House and Senate subcommittees to craft a conference report that seeks to maximize funding that will be allocated to the Department of Commerce. Department of State. the Department of Justice and the 18 other agencies included in this appropriations measure. It has been made clear from the development of H.R. 2076. that this measure would be subject to a Presidential veto. Today. as we debate this conference report it Is apparent the President will follow through to veto this measure. While I will support the conference agreement today. because it contains vital funding for very meritorious programs. I want to express my serious reservations with legislative language included in this measure that may seriously undermine the ability of law enforcement officials to effectively address crime in their respective States and cities. As you know. I have been a strong supporter of the 100.000 cops program. This program. which passed with widespread bipartisan support as part of the 1993 crime bill. In that bill. Congress authorized funds to go directly to where the problem exists: that is the shortage of law enforcement personnel. This important program would be administered in a block grant under the legislation now being considered. I am concerned that scarce dollars would be spend by some mayors on anything that can arguably be construed as law enforcement under a block granting scheme. Also. I want to once again. reiterate my strong support for drugcourt funding. In Denver. our drug court is a tough. lawenforcement oriented solution to societys drug problem. It has already begun to show success. It would be a mistake to eliminate this valuable tool for enforcement of our drug laws. Understanding this bill will be vetoed by the President. I look forward to working with my colleagues to reach a middle ground in a subsequent appropriations bill.",

State appropriations bill that I oppose is the language that prohibits the Department of State from spending any funds to expand our diplomatic relations with Vietnam until the President certifies that Vietnam is fully cooperating with the United States in four areas relating to POW/MIAs: First. resolving discrepancy cases. live sightings and field activities. second. recovering and repatriating American remains. third. accelerating efforts to provide documents that will help lead to the fullest possible accounting of POWIMIAs. and fourth. providing further assistance in implementing trilateral investigations with Laos. I must say that I am somewhat dumbfounded as to why we would include this provision. In fact. the President certified these four criteria this past summer. when he made the decision to move forward on full diplomatic relations with Vietnam. I certainly understand that there are many who disagree with that move. but the fact is that as President. he has the authority to conduct foreign affairs. and it is not appropriate for us to try to undercut him. Shortly after the President moved forward with full diplomatic relations. a vote was taken in the Senate on whether additional sanctions should be imposed against Vietnam. By an almost 2to1 margin. the Senate voted that no. we should not implement any more sanctions on Vietnam. Let me repeat that. By nearly 2toi. we in the Senate said \"no more sanctions on Vietnam.\" The President made the right decision in moving forward with full diplomatic relations. This provision would threaten those now relations without in any way helping to meet its goal of resolving MIA cases. Moving forward with relations and increasing bilateral contacts is the best way of achieving that goal. It appears almost certain that this bill is headed for a veto. which means we will have another opportunity to address this topic. I urge conferees to reconsider this provision and to eliminate this unnecessary and unhelpful encroachment on the Presidents power to conduct foreign policy.",

    "speech": "I wish to thank the Senators from Illinois and Massachusetts for their remarks on this important subject. The Violence Against Women Act is the first comprehensive measure aimed at making our Nations streets. college and university campuses. and homes safer for women. Following extensive hearings. the Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the act. and Congress passed this landmark legislation. Subtitle D of the act. entitled \"Equal Justice for Women in the Courts.\" was an important part of that legislation. As described by my colleagues. this provision encourages the circuit Judicial conferences to conduct studies of gender bias within their respective circuits and to disseminate their results. By enacting this provision. Congress intended to promote a greater understanding of the nature and extent of gender bias. to educate judges. and. ultimately. to reduce any bias. The Equal Justice for Women in the Courts Act takes us one step closer to achieving and maintaining equal justice under the law. It is an important part of an overall effort to ensure meaningful protection of the rights of those who were victimized by sex crimes. domestic violence. and crimes of violence motivated by gender. A majority of the Federal circuits have already established gender bias task forces. Some circuits have expanded the mission of the task forces to include the study of racial and ethnic bias issues as well. I strongly believe that these studies and related education and training programs are critical to understanding whether there is any disparate treatment in the courts and. if so. what steps the courts should take to address it. Task forces on gender. racial. and ethnic issues have been endorsed by. among others. the National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal. the LongRange Planning Committee of the Federal Courts and. as noted by my colleagues. the Federal Courts Study Committee and the Judicial Conference of the United States. As ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. and as the author of the Violence Against Women Act and the 1994 crime bill. I wish to join my colleagues in expressing my strong intent. that the Federal judiciary is authorized to use funds appropriated for violent crime reduction programs. as set out in title III of fiscal year 1996 CommerceJusticeState appropriations conference report. to study gender bias and other related barriers to equal justice in our courts.",

I am proud to say that in 1982. the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey established the Nations first task force on gender in the courts. Now. the majority of States have commissioned gender task forces and issued reports of their findings. In general. these studies have identified some problems in the State courts and identified steps that can be taken by the bench and bar to improve the fair treatment of attorneys. litigants. and employees. No one should question the importance of ensuring that our Federal courts truly function as fair. neutral adjudicators. Toward that end. the Federal courts should be commended for taking the steps to identify and. where it exists. to eradicate. gender bias in decisionmaking. employment. and the treatment of individuals. The work of these gender fairness task forces may not always be popular. The work may not always be comfortable for some. But in the end. their work will help ensure that the courts are. and are perceived to be. fair to all litigants. I agree with Senators SIMON. KENNEDY. BIDEN. and KERREY that the Federal judiciary is fully authorized under the Violence Against Women Act to conduct these important studies and that the allocation to the judiciary under this appropriations bill may be used for that purpose.",

I am glad to be part of legislation and of passing legislation that guarantees millions of Americans insurance coverage as they move from job to job. This bill also prevents discrimination against those individuals with preexisting conditions. This is a bipartisan effort that deserves enormous commendation. Unfortunately. Mr. Chairman. this bill has left 5 million Americans with mental illness behind. I had offered the House amendment in the Committee on Commerce to this bill to guarantee those with mental illness the same coverage as a person with any other Illness. Unfortunately. it was ruled out of order. Those mental health provisions. however. were included in the health insurance reform bill in the other body. This conference report fails to include mental health parity language and. therefore. to provide important protections for mental illness. Mental illness is just as serious as hearth disease or cancer. yet insurers have for years not offered complete coverage for the treatment of mental illness. Nearly one out of four adults suffer from some kind of severe mental illness in the United States each year. yet 95 per ant of the major insurance companies in our country have limited coverage for psychiatric care. Left untreated. mental illness can lead to some of our Nations most pressing social problems. For example. 32 percent of the Nations homeless suffer from some type of mental disorder. 12 million children suffer from some type of mental disorder also. Mr. Speaker. let us pass this bill. but in the future we must address the issue of mental health parity.

Passage of this conference report will ensure that Americans have access to health care coverage. The conference report before us will bring about much needed reform to the Insurance industry. It address such Important issues as portability and preexisting conditions. Individuals will no longer have to remain In a job they do not like in order to maintain Insurance coverage. The portability provisions will ensure that Individuals will not lose their coverage if they get sick. The conference report also contains a 4year demonstration project for tax deductible medical savings accounts for small business. the self employed. and the uninsured. The medical savings accounts will put the Individual In charge of his or her health coverage. Another important provisions of the conference report Is the selfemployment deduction for health Insurance expenses. Under this provision the selfemployed will be able to deduct a certain percentage of their health insurance expenses from their taxes. The deductible will increase from 30 percent to 80 percent in 2006. Mr. Speaker. the time has come to enact meaningful reform of our Insurance Industry. This conference report does that. It Is the result of many weeks of bipartisan negotiations. The provisions contained In this report will enable the American people to feel confident about their Insurance coverage. while at the same time keeping it affordable.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in support of the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Conference Report. Statistics show that under current law. up to 25 million Americans across the country are denied health insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions. Additionally. some 4 million workers remain \"joblocked\" because of the lack of health insurance portability. This is unacceptable. It is Inconceivable that. under current law. people with preexisting medical conditionswhose need for quality health care can be immediate--can be denied health insurance. People should not have to live in fear that a change in jobs. or job loss. could deny them continued health coverage. This bill Is a bipartisan and commonsense solution. It doesnt solve every problem. but it is a shining example of what can be accomplished through compromise. The key to health care reform is choice Americans should be free to choose what type of insurance they wantand which doctors they wish to see. Medical Savings Accounts are one of the most innovative new choices in health care. and it is encouraging that the House and Senate were able to reach a compromise to Institute MSAs on a 4year trial basis. While MSAs clearly are not right for everyone. they are a bold new approach to health care reform. MSAs are one more choice for people who need health insurance. This Conference Report Is also a major win for the selfemployed. in that it increases the percentage of their health Insurance expenses that they can deduct from 30 to 80 percent. Under current law. the selfemployed are permitted to deduct a mere 30 percent of their health insurance costs. while corporations can deduct 100 percent. This is unfair. People who are selfemployed should not be discouraged from buying Insurance because they are forced to pay a de facto tax penalty. We must eventually increase this deduction to the 100 percent enjoyed by corporations. but for now. 80 percent is a great Improvement The Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act does not involve a government takeover of health care. It does. however. solve specific problems In the current system and institutes new ideas to help all Americansyoung and old--obtain health coverage. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the bill and pass this muchneeded reform.",

Nowhere is readiness more important than for the numerous State National Guards who serve this country. The National Guard represents over half of Americas military force. I believe that the policies set forth by this Congress should certainly reflect the crucial importance of the National Guard for the security needs of this country. But the Gutierrez amendment certainly does not reflect that belief. because it would eliminate a much needed training site located at Tullahoma. TN. This amendment could effectively serve to damage and undermine the effectiveness and readiness of the Tennessee Army National Guard and the U.S. Armed Forces. Mr. Chairman. the Tennessee National Guard. the U.S. military. and the millions of Americans who depend on both of them for protecting our interests at home and abroad need the training site at Tullahoma. The Tullahoma facility certainly would serve a legitimate and strategic role for Americas security interests. It would provide tough and realistic training conditions for our troops. This facility would support the training of the 278th Armored Cavalry Regimentone of only 15 regiments which has been designated as an enhanced readiness brigade. I might add that an enhanced readiness brigade is the highest level of readiness for deployment. Furthermore. Mr. Chairman. the Tullahoma site would serve to train the 196th Field Artillery Brigadeone of only two National Guard artillery brigades that served in the gulf war. And it would be the training site for several other important troops and brigades as well. Mr. Chairman. it is of vital importance that the soldiers of the Tennessee Army National Guard are provided with the proper training to allow them to carry out their mission. When we turn to the Guard. it is with the understanding that they are properly trained and prepared to confront whatever the task at hand may be in a ready manner.

This is clearly targeted at a vital project to maintain the readiness of the Army National Guard. This portion of the military construction budget goes to a critical requirement for a modified record fire range. This project is a priority with the Army National Guard up and down the chain of command. This range will have a direct positive impact on readiness. The National Guard has a proud tradition of service to the country. And I know I do not need to remind you of the important role the National Guard plays in our overall defense strategy. The soldiers of the National Guard must be trained to meet the mobilization mission for deployment in support of the U.S. Army. This range will assist in the readiness required to meet the individual. and collective. range training to meet the mobilization mission. This site will support the training of the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment. one of only 15 scheduled for designation as an Enhanced Readiness Brigade. which is the highest readiness level for deployment. With the significant cut in force structure that has occurred in recent years. the capability and competence of the National Guard are more important than ever to maintain our edge. The modified record fire range is not a glamour project. Ask anyone who has ever fired on one. It is a challenging. realistic battle training requirement.

This bill has the authorization requiring the completion of that project.

So I share the Senators sentiments and thank her for her kind remarks.",

Measured in length. it may be my best in the opinion of many of my valued colleagues on both sides of the aisle. What will I miss? Not the Washington DC morning traffic. and driving the obstacle courses. My Ford Taurus will get a reprieve from this pot hole capital of the world. My pocketbook will be spared from the $35 a shot in used hubcap replacement. experienced 10 times in only the last 2 years. With any luck. the Whitehurst freeway and its tributaries will be fully operable for 90 consecutive days sometime in the 21st century. I leave this place with the confidence that we will continue to build our bridges to the future of America on the firm footings of national security policy. I have labored on the Armed Services Committee for the past 18 years. We won the cold war. after spending a lot of money. without firing a shot. I suggest that that is the best way to win wars. As the only true superpower of the world. we have the dual responsibility of providing for a strong national defense and. just as important. using our statute to lead and promote peace and understanding. including ratification and implementation of international agreements. To that end. a keen disappointment has been the failure this year to ratify in a timely fashion the chemical weapons convention. A bright spot has been the signing at the United Nations 10 days or so ago of the compenhensive nuclear test ban treaty. This treaty is one that this Senator has been very much involved with. When I was in New York for that signing event. it was inspiring as a giant leap for mankinds survival. An editional from the Omaha WorldHerald dated September 5. 1996. makes the case very well and I ask that it be printed in the RECORD immediately following my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. perhaps one of the greatest characteristics of our form of government is that it encourages literally anybody and everybody to seek elected office. As a result. we have avoided the creation of an elite ruling class. and the men and women who represent us in public office are individuals of diverse. interesting. and unique backgrounds. Just look to the 100 members of this Body and you will find a richly varied collection of experience and professions among our colleagues. and Senator BILL BRADLEY has perhaps the most unique background of our colleagues. Though not a native son of the Garden State. BILL BRADLEY has been a part of New Jersey and the Northeast since his days as a history student at Princeton University. Clearly his time on that campus helped to influence how he would spend his years as an adult. A star member of the Tigers basketball team. BILL would serve as the Captain of the 1964 Olympic basketball team and eventually go on to play professional basketball for the New York Knicks for 10 years. BILLs excellence was not limited to under the baskets. his performance as a student earned him a coveted Rhodes Scholarship to the prestigious Oxford University where he received a masters degree. For the past 18 years. BILL BRADLEY has ably represented the people of New Jersey in this Body. During his career as a Senator. BILL has brought many of the traits he learned on the basketball courts. and in the halls of two of the worlds greatest learning institutions. to this Chamber. Without question. he is a careful student of the issues that come before the Senate. and he is always a thoughtful contributor to our debates. In particular. he is a forceful and passionate advocate for matters that are particularly close to his heart. which include economic development. the environment. education. fighting crime. and promoting racial harmony and equality. Mr. President. despite his popularity. Senator BRADLEY has decided not to seek a fourth term in the U.S. Senate. While we will miss his participation in the National debate. I am certain that he will continue to seek ways in which to serve New Jersey and the United States. I join my friends and colleagues in wishing him well in whatever he chooses to pursue.",

Senator CLAIBORNE PELL of Rhode Island is one such man. For the past 36 years. CLAIBORNE PELL has served capably and selflessly in this body. working hard to represent the interests and concerns of his constituents. In the process. he has championed a number of issues and measures that have become a regular and important part of life in America for many of our citizens. Among the accomplishments our colleague is most proud of are the establishment of Pell Grants. the National Endowment for the Arts. the National Endowment for the Humanities. and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Perhaps more than anything else. though. Senator PELL will be remembered for his commitment to the Foreign Relations Committee. Given CLAmORNEs rich background in international affairs. it is not surprising that he should end up as one of this Bodys and Nations leading experts on foreign policy. Following his service as an officer in the Coast Guard during World War E. CLA ORNE became a member of the Foreign Service. representing American interests in Czechoslovakia and Italy. Undoubtedly this extensive background was most beneficial to Senator PELL as he carried out his duties on the Committee on Foreign Relations. especially when he became its chairman. A small State such as Rhode Island builds power and prestige through seniority. and during his almost four decades in the Senate CLAIBORNE PELL has worked tirelessly on behalf of his constituents. Without question. the \"Ocean State\" has benefited greatly from the dedicated service of its senior. and longest serving. Senator. Whoever replaces our friend in this Chamber will have a challenging task in attempting to match the commitment CLAIBORNE FELL brought to this job. Mr. President. it has been a pleasure to have served with Senator PELL these many years. He is a man of integrity and ability who has done much to make our Nation a better and stronger place. I wish him great health and much happiness in the years to come.",

DAVID has capably represented the people of Arkansas as their Governor. and in both Houses of Congress.

In 1979. he moved across the Hill to the Senate where he is about to complete his third term in office. Through his position on several key committees. DAVID has been able to work to make Arkansas an even better place to live. and I know his constituents are thankful for his efforts. Though DAVID and I did not share any committee assignments. I have enjoyed serving with him in the Senate these many years. The \"Sheriff\". as I liked to call him as his father held that office in Arkansas. always approached his duties with enthusiasm and dedication. and he upheld the finest traditions of this institution.

Though the 100 Members of this body have views on the issues that are often far apart. we debate our differences politely and completely. and more often than not. are able to arrive at a compromise that benefits the majority of Americans. One Senator in particular has repeatedly demonstrated himself to be an individual of great decency and courtesy. This Senator is my good friend from Illinois. PAUL SIMON. Senator SIMON has dedicated his adult life to public service. Beginning with a stint in the U.S. Army in the early fifties. and soon after his return to civilian life. he was elected to the fllinois house in 1954. and then to the Illinois senate in 1962. After his service in the legislature. PAUL SIMON was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. where he served for 10 years. and played an important role in legislation concerning education. job training. and was instrumental in the establishment of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Since PAUL came to the Senate in 1984. we have worked together on many legislative initiatives. especially as we both had seats on the Judiciary and Labor and Human Resources Committees. I commend Senator SIMON for his willingness to listen to debate with an open mind. and for having the resolve to reach an agreement that is in the best interest of our Nation. I have enjoyed working with my friend from Illinois through the years. and the Senate will not be the same without him. Unquestionably.

Blessed with both great academic and athletic gifts. BILL BRADLEY graduated from my alma mater. Princeton University. with honors in American history. He won a rhodes scholarship to Oxford University. where he earned his graduate degree after studying politics. philosophy. and economics. He was best known to many. before he came to the Senate. as a basketball player of tremendous skill and talent. During his career in the Senate. four principles have guided BILL BRADLEY. He has sought to restore economic and personal security for American families. strengthen our civil society. protect our natural heritage and rethink Americas role in the world. He has worked toward these goals on the Senate Finance Committee. the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Special Committee on Aging. Others may focus on his contributions in the fields of economics and taxes. but I believe he BILL BRADLEY has been particularly effective in building bridges between peoples and spreading the values of democracymethods which I also consider the best ways of building lasting security and peace. BILL BRADLEY wrote the 1992 Freedom Exchange Act. the largest U.S. educational exchange initiative in history. I understand that more than 10.000 \"Bradley kids\" have come here from the former Soviet Union to study and absorb our culture and the lessons for freedom. democracy and a market economy. The Senate will miss him and his spirit of independence. I am confident that. although he is retiring. he will not be out of public life. Whatever he and his family do.

Such are the ties on which my friendship with the senior Senator from Wyoming has been based. The initial tie was through his father. our former colleague. Milward L. Simpson. who in his early yearsprobably while he was a student at Harvard Law School in the 1920searned high repute as a tutor. And among the students he tutored with great effectiveness. were the children of my uncle. Clarence Pell. So I feel that my friendship with Senator ALAN SIMPSON began long ago with this family association..1 ALAN SIMPSON brought to his work here in the Senate rare attributes of grace and good humorqualities which help immeasurably in facilitating the often contentious and trying process of political accommodation. To my mind. these qualities of mind and spirit. which do so much to promote comity and civility. are almost as important as the substance of the great good work that ALAN SIMPSON has done in the fields of immigration reform. veterans affairs. and entitlement reform. Indeed. his success as a legislator is attributable in no small measure to the refreshing traits of character which he brought to the effort. Most important of all is his wonderful sense of humora quality often lacking in this body. I value my association with ALAN and Ann SIMPSON over the years and wish them well in all that lies ahead.",

House Resolution 418 is an open rule which will allow full and fair debate on H.R. 2641. a bill to change the way U.S. marshals are appointed. As my colleague from Ohio described. this rule provides 1 hour of general debate. equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. Under this rule amendments will be allowed under the 5minute rule. the normal amending process in the House. All Members. on both sides of the aisle. will have the opportunity to offer amendments. The U.S. Marshals Service is the Nations oldest Federal law enforcement agency. dating back to 1789. The Service has critical responsibilities. including providing protection for the Federal courts and responding to emergencies. I am particularly proud of the U.S. marshals who are based in the Dayton. OH. Federal building. where I maintain my district office. This bill will require the U.S. marshals be appointed on a meritbased. competitive process. instead of the current political appointment process. This will improve the professional status of this extremely important Federal agency. It is a longoverdue improvement. Mr. Speaker. while I do not oppose the rule. I urge a \"no\" vote on the previous question. If the previous question is defeated. I shall offer an amendment to the rule which would make in order a new section in the rule. This provision would direct the Committee on Rules to report a resolution immediately that would provide for consideration of a bill to incrementally increase the minimum wage from its current $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour beginning on July 4.1997. This provides for a separate vote on the minimum wage. Let me make it clear to my colleagues. both Democrats and Republicans. defeating the previous question will allow the House to vote on the minimum wage increase.

That is what we ought to be debating ultimately. and to see whether or not we are strong enough to withstand the temptation to go into ultravirus issues like the minimum wage and concentrating on bringing about better government in the election of U.S. marshals. part of our law enforcement. who do a wonderful job not in just helping the courts. but in helping the community.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker. I was very interested to hear people talk about how this was going to be a tax increase. We are some of the few people who actually paid by taxes from the American people. and if we raise the minimum wage to $5.15. the minimum wage people working 40 hours a week would still make less than Members of this House make in 1 month. It is a shame. it is an outrage. that we are not able to get a vote on the minimum wage. That is why I am asking for a vote against the previous question. I should point out that in Oregon. our legislature raised the minimum wage to $4.75. and. since 1992. since Bill Clinton has been in office. our unemployment rate has been halved in Oregon. We. are doing very well in Oregon. We presently have an initiative from the people of Oregon to raise the minimum wage in Oregon to $6.50. Yet these people here on this side of the aisle are saying no. we cannot even talk about raising the minimum wage. Seventyfive percent of people living on minimum wage. and let me tell you if you work 40 hours a week. if you lived on minimum wage today. you would make $8.840 a year. 75 percent of those people are women. 75 percent are women. This is antiwomen to not allow this vote to be brought to the House floor. How can we stand here. paid as we are by the American taxpayer. and not have the opportunity to raise the minimum wage for the women of this country who are living on less than S9.000 a year? A family of two is under the poverty level if they make $10.260. so somebody making $8.000 is way below the poverty level. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on the previous question. Let us give the American people a raise. They deserve it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this is silly season already. Usually it does not come until August. If this were really an important issue for people earning $9.000 a year or less. why did not the Democrats. who owned the House. the Senate. and the White House. mention it 2 years ago? Do you know how many times the President talked about the minimum wage in his first 2 years in office? Zero. Not one time. He has talked about it over 50 times this year. because it is a political issue. and it is a crass and mean political issue. using as pawns in this political battle the very people they are pretending to help. Raising the minimum wage is income redistribution among the poor. For every four people you purport to give a Si increase to. you take one person off the payroll. That is not compassion. It is the striking difference between the two parties. that one party thinks government should set wages. and the other party believes the economy sets wages. This argument should be over. There should be zero minimum wage. That is what the New York Times editorial said. a zero minimum wage. Let people who want to start on the first rung of the income ladder earn what they are worth. Ninety percent of people on minimum wage are not there after 1 year. Many people on the minimum wage earn also tips that are not reported. This is a phony argument for phony political reasons. and. if It was serious. it would have been done 2 years ago. In addition to that. the minimum wage is simply not germane to this bill and would not be added even if the previous question were defeated. because it is not germane to this bill. It is simply an effort to take up your time and Americas time to make political points that they refused to deal with when they were in power.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I really differ strongly with the previous speaker on this issue. First of all. I would say that I do not believe the minimum wage is a partisan issue. There are a lot of Republicans who support an increase in the minimum wage. The problem here is the Republican leadership. Speaker GINGRICH and the others. who do not want to bring this to the floor. because they know that if it comes to the floor. the majority of Democrats and enough Republicans will vote for it that it will actually pass this House. the Senate. and be signed by the President. Let us bring it up. What do I care what President Clinton said or what whoever said in the previous Congress? The fact of the matter is now we know that this minimum wage is not keeping up with inflation. and with the peoples ability or need and the purchasing power. So it should be passed now. The reason the Democrats are doing this as often as we are on the previous question or on the rule or whatever. is because we are in the minority and we have no other way to bring it up. We have to keep raising it. so eventually this Republican leadership will wake up and recognize that even its own Members. even a lot of the Republicans. are willing and want this passed and want it brought to the floor. The time has come. In my home State of New Jersey. we have raised the minimum wage. and it has been a success and it has not affected unemployment.",
