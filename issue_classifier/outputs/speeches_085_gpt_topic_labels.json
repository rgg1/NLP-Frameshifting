    "speech": "I invite the attention of my colleagues to the fact that in one of the articles entitled \"The Irony of Lebanon.\" Mr. Geyelin says: Too ardent United States wooing spurs rising antiAmericanism. He then goes on to ask the question: What went wrong with United States policy in Lebanon? Then he gives the answers: The United States. many observers maintain. has been overly lavish in its affection for Mr. Chamoun. The lesson of the Lebanese upheaval. in short. is that the Wests ties with friendly Middle East political leaders can sometimes be too tight. Farther along in the article we find the following. quoting a Lebanese official: \"Nasser has been gunning for Chamoun ever since Lebanon accepted Eisenhowers doctrine.\" says one American. Adds a western oil man: \"It does not pay for anybody in this part of the world to be close to the West.\" A member of Mr. Chamouns cabinet bluntly warns that the United States is \"on the wrong side of a popular issuenationalism. Your doctrine and your Sixth Fleet are only hurting your friends.\" This sentiment was often expressed by one of our very dear friends. the Foreign Minister of Lebanon. The Foreign Minister is quoted in this very article as pointing out: Even Mr. Chamouns able and ardently proWestern Foreign Minister. Charles Malik. admits the Sixth Fleets saber rattling offers \"embarrassment\" as well as a sense of security. More important than these critiques is the question in many minds of whether the crisis would have happened at all. or at least been so violent. if the United States-* Lebanese alliance had not been quite so close. These are not my words. These are the words of a responsible reporter and observer for a great American newspaper which is read by conservative people. by a very select American public opinion audience. For reasons discussed In these articles and others like them. Mr. President. it seemed to me last month that the President should call for a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Lebanese problem. I made such a suggestion on June 26. 1958. and ask unanimous consent that my remarks at that time be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

This would greatly weaken NATO. Suppose. on the other hand. we were to give aid to Israel. Then we should be giving aid to both sides. and each side would say that we were favoring the other.

    "speech": "Yes. I read from my speech on February 27 at page 2690 of the RECORD: Mr. President. there are at least two reasons. in the area of military aid alone. First. Secretary Dulles testified that some of the Middle Eastern countries would not agree to use the military equipment we might give them as a contribution to the defense of the free world. Mr. Dulles stated: The free world has connotations in that part of the world which principally seem to. in their mind. refer to Britain and France. Second. Secretary Dulles said some of the Middle Eastern countries would not permit continuous observations and review by United States representatives of the program of assistance. as required by section 10 of the Mutual Security Act. I also said: For my own part. Mr. President. I do not think our country can afford to give arms to the countries of the Middle East without knowing what they will do with those arms. Without supervision. observation. and review. how would we prevent the use of American equipment by both sides should the fighting between Israel and the Arab world be renewed? As for objections on the part of some midEastern nations to the words free world. I think any attempt to erase that term would be absolutely futile. Certainly. the President of the United States himself has indicated on any number of occasions that the entire purpose of this socalled doctrine is to preserve and maintain freedom in the world. What the pending resolution does is to lift those conditions. I am glad that the Senator is trying to reimpose at least some of them.

The greatest difficulty I find with the Senators amendment is not -because of its intent. but if we are going to require that the nations submit all matters in controversy with neighboring nations to direct negotiation with such neighboring nations in a goodfaith effort. and so forth. we must have a treaty. and the negotiations would require more time than is allowed for the purpose by this amendment.",

Provision (b) reads To submit all matters in controversy with neighboring nations to direct negotiations with such neighboring nations in a good faith effort to settle such controversies by mutual agreement. and failing agreement to submit the matters in dispute to arbitration. Provision (c) reads: In the case of military assistance. not to use any such assistance except for selfdefense within its own borders without the consent of the United States. As I understand the law which is in effect today. the only new element which the amendment inserts is provision (b). which relates to arbitration. The other two provisions-(a) and (c)-are already a part of the Mutual Sedurity Act. and are contained in section 105 (a). Does the Senator from Illinois agree with me?",

Moreover. statistics show that 66 million Americans listen to radio daily and the dramatic growth of this industry in our vast communications network is exemplified by the 3.600 AM and FM stations now broadcasting in the United States compared with 600 stations just 10 years ago. Our reliance on radio is demonstrated by the fact that the stations throughout the country are geared to broadcast on a seconds notice any threat to our national security. while giving us timely information on disasters and other emergency situations from day to day.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the American people are now engaged in a salutary reappraisal of their educational system. As part of this process. from time to time the charge has been made that those who administer our schools are largely to blame for the weaknesses in our schools. Unquestionably some of our educators have been both uninspired and shortsighted. but one wonders if this indictment has not been badly overdrawn. A few days ago a perceptive young editor in my congressional district. Jones Osborn. the editor of the Yuma. Ariz.. Daily Sun. had some trenchant comments on this question in his Editors Notebook column. His observations follow: THE Enrros NoTzzoox (By Jones Osborn) Ever since October (birth of Sputnik I) weve heard much about our schools. Would this be a fair summary of those comments. 1. United States schools teach too much frills. not enough basic courses. and standards are too low. 2. Most American parents are unhappy about this and would like it changed. but3. Most professional educators are resisting such changes. Perhaps that isnt a fair summary. But the Gallup poll tackled the question. Three thousands parents and one thousand one hundred highschool principals were asked: \"Do you think our public schools today demand too much work or too little work from the students?\" Ninety percent of the principals said \"Too little.\" But only 51 percent of the parents. Another question: \"Some people say that colleges should raise their entrance requirements. making it harder for highschool graduates to enter. Do you think colleges should do this?\" Fortynine percent of principals said \"Yes.\" But only 27 percent of parents agreed. In fact. most parents (62 percent) thought standards should not be raised. I think we might keep this in mind. For in the final analysis. the public schools are just about what the public is prepared to support. no better. no worse.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this points up exactly what some of us have been saying. As we study the section. the things that are wrong with section 121 begin to become apparent. While I commend the Senator from Ohio for trying to shore up what is obviously a bad section of the bill. I am surprised to hear an admission that such a change in the bill will make it all right. A day or two ago it was stated that the section was all right. Senators were saying that section 121 would do no damage. It was defended. and it was stated that there was nothing wrong with section 121. Now the able Senator from Ohio proposes an amendment which would put the authority in the President of the United States. rather than the Attorney General. It is then said that that is the way it should have been in the first place. I point out only this: I am not trying in the slightest to say anything against what the Senator from Ohio has proposed. I think as the section is studied over and over again. it will be realized that there is only one thing to do with section 121. and that is to strike it from the bill. That is what the Senator from Vermont. the Senator from South Dakota. and I have proposed to dodelete it. and thus eliminate the complicated and perplexing questions which would arise under it. The Senator from Ohio. who has been militantly concerned about what the Federal Government can do. because he was for a long time the executive of a great State. realizes that this power should not be placed in the Attorney General to institute actions on behalf of the United States. that a man who is appointed to an office ought not to have that sort of authority. I think the section would be improved by his amendment.",

I am glad the Senator from Ohio has pointed out a glaring weakness in section 121. but I agree with the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from South Dakota that the only way we can get rid of this menace is to eliminate section 121 from the bill. My own opinion is that the perfecting amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio makes the danger greater rather than less. If the Attorney General should undertake to get highhanded and assume rights which belong to the States. communities. and the individuals who live there. there is a President who can hold the reins. If a President takes it into his head to go ahead and exercise this great power which Congress had never been asked for before. then there is no check over him whatsoever. other than the impeachment procedure. which Congress should be certainly very. very reluctant to impose. I do not think the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio makes things better. it makes them worse. I ask Senators to think back through the years to previous Presidents and Attorneys General. In the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt we had Attorney General Biddle. The Senator from Ohio would have put abnormal law enforcement powers in the hands of President Roosevelt rather than Attorney General Biddle. The Senator from Ohio would have put the same abnormal legal powers in the hands of President Truman rather than Attorney General McGrath. If the amendment does anything. it makes the situation worse. because if the Attorney General undertakes to usurp powers belonging to the Etates. towns. communities. and individuals. as he could under section 121. then the President can have some control over the Attorney General. When it comes to putting this power in the hands of a President. with nobody having control over him. I would not give this power to any President. I do not say I would not trust any President. but I would not give this power to any President. I would not even give it to the next President.",

In the 85th Congress. however. we have faced and are facing a definite challenge to see wilderness preservation legislation become a reality. We have seen the wilderness bill subjected to hearings in both the House and Senate. We have had the reports of the executive departments. We have had the criticisms and suggestions of those who. for one reason or another. have opposed it in whole or in part. We have had an increasing public interest and an encouraging expression of editorial approvalcommendations in newspaper editorials from coast to coast: Boston. in the Christian Science Monitor. New York. in the New York Times. Washington. in the Post and Times Herald. St. Louis. in the PostDispatch. San Francisco. in the Chronicle. Portland. Oreg.. in the Oregon Journalto name a few and outstanding examples. As a result of all these comments. suggestions. criticisms. commendations. we have had an excellent opportunity to clarify and improve the bill and to change it so far as possible to meet objections. Mr. President. we have been meeting this challenge. Following the hearings last June and the conferences that came later with experts in our executive agencies and with others who have been specially concerned. a revised form of the bill was prepared. and this revision has itself been subjected to further scrutiny and revision. This second revision of the bill is in the form of an Interior Committee Print No. 2. and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

The question of trading with Communist China had been raised in Japan by a group of businessmen who signed a trade agreement with Peiping and submitted it to their Government for approval. The Japanese Government responded with a firm statement of specifications for any such agreement. namely. that it would in no sense constitute recognition of the Chinese Communist government. and that Chinese trade missions would not be allowed to fly the Communist flag in Tokyo. This position clearly recognized that Peiping sought. not trade. but the presumptive approval of the Japanese Government. The accuracy of this view has been demonstrated by the subsequent action of the Chinese in breaking off further negotiations. The Japanese Government is to be highly commended for taking such a firm and realistic stand against any kind of recognition or quasirecognition of Red China. For this reason.

This same publication by the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation shows in other tables the excises increased or newly imposed during or subsequent to World War II which are still in effect. By the Revenue Acts of 1941. 1942. and 1943. existing rates were doubled. and some more than doubled. A new list of goods and services was added. Among the new excises which were Imposed purely as war taxes were those on transportation and on local telephone service. The new tax on transportation of persons went as high as 15 percent during World War II. it has subsequently been reduced only to 10 percent. The 3 percent tax on transportation of goodsand that means the freight on which American industry thriveswas imposed in 1942. It remains in full force today. The wartime tax on local telephone service. first imposed in 1941. reached 15 ljercent in 1943 and has been reduced only to 10 percent. The wartime retailers excises on luggage. handbags. wallets. jewelry. furs. and toilet preparations went as high as 20 percent and now remain at 10 percent.

What bothers me is that we have before us an emergency bill which must meet the deadline of June 30th at the end of the present fiscal year. I feel it is necessary that the tax structure be continued for another year. and that to attach amendments to the bill giving tax relief to special areas is the wrong approach. I agree with the unanimous action of the Committee of the House with the action of the House. and with the unanimous action of the Committee on Finance of the Senate in feeling that the subject should be treated in a clean bill. with no amendments and no encumbrances. providing for no reduction of taxes in connection with the pending bill. I have received letters from nearly every industry in my State of New Jersey asking for a particular tax cut. I have said to my railroad friends that I would do all I could to get relief for the railroads. because they must have such relief. However. I believe we would be making a serious mistake if we were to make an exception and give a tax cut to the railroads in the pending bill. particularly when it is almost inevitable. unless all of us lose our minds. that the railroads will be given relief this year in the bill we passed providing relief for them in another area. That bill is now pending in the House. That would be a proper bill to which to add a provision with regard to taxes. It should not be done on the pending bill. which must be enacted before the June 30 deadline. In spite of the fact that I told my good friend. the Senator from Florida [Mr. SMATHERSI. that I was entirely in favor of railroad relief legislation.

While there was evidence that passenger business was being increasingly lost to the air. bus carriers. and the private passenger automobile. in my opinion. it did not establish that the elimination of the passenger excise tax would restore to the railroads any part of the passenger business.

Is the repeal of the excise tax under discussion more important than the repeal of the excise taxes on communications. local telephone service. telegraph service. admissions to theaters. tax on toilet preparations? It has been said that the present recession is due to the lack of purchases of hard goods. Is the tax under discussion more important than the excise tax on automobiles. refrigerators. household appliances?

    "speech": "Mr. President. this transportation tax is the most burdensome tax which is now on our statute books. The tax enters repeatedly and cumulatively into the cost of every necessity of life. It enters into the cost of the penicillin shot. into the cost of the babys rompers. and into the cost of every ounce of food consumed by every single citizen in this country. The tax is particularly burdensome on small business and small industry. An industry which is large enough to own its own fleet of trucks does not have to rely on common carriers and does not have to pay this 3percent tax. In my State. the leading lumberproducing State in the Nation. the small logger has to hire a common carrier to carry his logs and lumber. and he must pay the 3percent tax. The largest absentee lumber company is in the State of the distinguished Senator from California. and has its own fleet of trucks. Therefore. it starts off with a 3percent transportation cost advantage over the small competitor. to say nothing of other advantages. Furthermore and in conclusion. there Is no other tax which so discriminates against two great regions of the country as does this tax. which discriminates against the Far West. from which I come. and which discriminates against the South. from which the distinguished junior Senator from Florida comes. We represent the regions farthest from their markets. These are the regions which have to go 2.500 miles in the case of the West or 1.000 miles in the case of the South to find a market for their products. as well as to buy many necessities for their consumers. We beg Senators to take from the necks of western agriculture and western industry and southern industry the yoke of this burdensome 3percent Federal freight tax.",

News Leader: WASHINGTONS RIGHT To KNow A keenly interesting story appeared the other day on the city page of the Washington Post and Times Herald. The headline read. \"D. C. Seen Facing Catastrophe in Illegitimacy.\" and the text of the story. which was based upon a hitherto unpublished report by Dr. John R. Gates of the Southwest Health Center. went on to spell out some horrifying facts upon the extent of illegitimacy in Washingtons public schools. A study of 13 Junior high schools found a problem of illegitimacy more serious than in New York City. Philadelphia. or Ridhmond. The problem demands immediate and serious consideration. Pregnancies are increasing among teenaged girls. So are abortions. and these latter present an alarming medical problem. Some male teenagers have confessed to fathering 2 to 8 children. One boy. 8 years of age. has been expelled for abnormal sex play. One mother. having 7 illegitimate children of her own. reported that her 12yearold daughter is now pregnant. That the situation is growing rapidly worse is indicated by the fact that in 194849. only 7 pregnancies were reported to the Southwest Health Center. while this year 82 pregnancies have been recorded among girls 13 to 17 years old. These sordid and distressing facts were reported by the Washington Post and Times Herald. and what interests us. among other things. is that Mr. J. Russell Wiggins is A5443 executive editor of the Washington Post and Times Herald. and Mr. Wiggins has established a national reputation and won many kudos for his defense of what is known as the peoples right to know. It would not seem too much to suggest that the people of Washington have a right to know the extent to which this problem of illegitimacy exists among Negro teenagers. and the extent to which it exists among whites. Yet amazingly enough. though one may read the Washington Post and Times Heralds story from top to bottom. this rather essential fact never appears. What. we would ask Mr. Wiggins. do his people have a right to know? *NaturalGas Legislation",

I have now received an official reply from the State Department which I believe is most interesting since it outlines American policy and thinking on this matter at the present time. Briefly. I had proposed in my letter that the United States should issue a declaration to the world stating that this country will make no Hbomb tests for a period of 6 months regardless of what other countries do. In this declaration the United States is to state clearly that we are taking this action in the interests of safeguarding humanity and civilization against the mortal perils of nuclear fallout. Furthermore. I proposed that the declaration is to call on Soviet Russia and Great Britain to follow our example in accepting \"this brief moratorium or trial period for the suspension of nuclear tests.\" and that if this 6month trial period proves a success on the part of all concerned then it can be extended for a longer period of time. On July 8. 1957. the State Department addressed a reply to my letter. signed by John S. Hoghland II. Acting Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations. It is worth recalling at this point that at the disarmament conference. now going on in London. the United States recently. proposed the suspension of Hbomb tests for a period of 10 months.

He states that the foolish but once popular dream of world government is gradually being demolished by time and experience. His article follows: What has become of the fantasy. so popular immediately after the end of the last war. of setting up a world federal government that would make good the writ of international law? There was a time when world federalist organizations made a considerable splash in this country. when State legislatures passed resolutions favoring world government. when college professors abandoned bridge and crossword puzzles for the more exciting diversion of drawing up constitutions for a world state. with attempts to balance the competing claims of population. literacy. political and economic power in voting procedures for a world parliament. Now there is a vast silence on this subject. Some of the State legislative resolutions have been rescinded. the others have been forgotten. Little is heard of the young man who once made headlines by proclaiming himself a citizen of the world and getting himself expelled from various countries for lack of proper passport credentials. The groups which still plug the cause of world federalism attract scant attention. Decisive proof of the fadeout of support for the idea of a supranational organization with coercive power is the failure of .any nation to take advantage of the provision in the United Nations Charter which authorizes the calling of a convention to revise the charter 10 years after it went into effect. For a time there was much talk of \"strengthening the U. N.\" by means of such a convention.

Wherever newspapermen who take pride in their craft gather to compare notes. they speak of the Monitor with respect and admiration. For here is one of the truly great newspapers in the world. noted for its accurate reportage of national and international events and for the fair and balanced content of its editorials. It is a model for students of journalism and is the daily reference for all people who must depend on reliable and objective coverage of world news as the basis for sound opinion and right decision. Step by step. since 1908. the Christian Science Monitor has built its reputation by unwavering dedication to the truth. The home of the Monitor is Boston. Mass. Here. nourished by the principles of the First Church of Christ. Scientist. and the intellectual climate of New England. it developed those standards of honest. accurate. and clear journalism that have won for it such universal esteem. The Monitor never sacrificed quality to gain mass circulation. You will not find \"cheesecake.\" gossip. or lurid tales in its columns. But you will find the national and global news for mature and responsible people based on factual reporting that you can trust. For the Monitor expects and receives from its firstrate correspondents around the world the dispatches and the interpretations covering significant events that have firmly established its reputation as an international daily newspaper. I suspect that even the Kremlin is secretly. though grudgingly. impressed by its character. As we face up to the responsibilities of the space age. it is apparent that we will have to change some of our attitudes of recent years and recover the standards and real values that have been lost in the concentration on material progress. The Christian Science Monitor has never surrendered its standards to the temptations of the sensational headline or the slanted story. By devotion to the highest principles of journalism it has earned its position among the worlds great newspapers. We congratulate the Christian Science Monitor on its 50th anniversary.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last week I cast a vote in this.House which was both preceded and followed by much soul searching on my part. I refer to the action of Thursday in voting to increase the public debt limit by $5 billion. The action we took that day was a needful one. but it was a shameful commentary on our Nations immediate past. We had to vote the debt limit increase solely because we have a balance of a billion dollars. and bills that already total more than that. Obviously if we had not voted the increase our Government would have had to default its bills in a step toward the destruction of our national credit. Chaos undoubtedly would have followed. I had a rather positive feeling then. as I have now. that this action should not have been necessary. Those who voted against it had some very sound reasons or principle for doing so. First of all. I would have been more than naive had I placed full faith on the assurance contained in the measure that this was only a temporary debt limit increase. We all know how the word \"temporary\" has changed in meaning in recent generations. There are temporary buildings built some 40 years ago which threaten to outlast us all. There were temporary programs enacted during the depression years which are still on the books and still actively in use. \"Temporary\" has become a meaningless word and there is nothing to indicate that this temporary debt limit increase will not be with us for a long time to come. Then there is the reasonable argument that this measure would not have been necessary had other Members of the House followed the voting procedure as I did last year when I voted against more than $10 billion in appropriations or authorizations. But unfortunately the majority of the Members of Congress did not have that kind of economy voting record. For too many years in the past our Legislature has not had that kind of a voting record. And the result came Thursday when we had to vote for the debt increase or face grave dangers of financial chaos. I voted for that measure with great reluctance. Under similar circumstances. I shall not do so again in the future. After 45?",

All have the same story. \"Nobody wants to hire you after you are 45.\" We send millions of dollars to Indochina and countries all over the world. to keep them from suffering. while here in our own country. we have people suffering from hunger. illness. loneliness. and the crushed spirit of people unwanted and dispossessed. The skills and talents of these people brought America through wars and developments. They are not asking for jobs that pay $100 per week. but simply asking for a chance to work. live. and exist as a decent citizen. Our Government spends millions to salvage corn. to save butter and eggs. yet are we over 45 surplus people? Our services and experiences. though they may be limited. should receive part of the attention given to surplus food. Before year 1958 these people have to become 65 before they are eligible for socialsecurity pensions. and after 65. many are not eligible. if they have not the required number of quarter years worked where social security deductions were made. There is a period of 20 long years from 45 to 65. The majority of these people have raised families and found it impossible to save enough money to live without work from 45 to 65a period of 20 years. Our lawmakers have passed a law whereby there should be no discrimination regarding age on employment. but it has failed to eliminate this condition. How much longer will our country. that prides itself on fighting prejudice and segregation of color. continue to cultivate prejudice against employment after 45? We. the people of America. believe that our clergymen. Roman Catholics. Protestants. Jewish. and all who profess to be Christian should follow the example of God in behalf of these unfortunate people over 45 with the lawmakers of our country. to uphold the Constitution of the United States for all men and women so that they may work and live as decent citizens after 45.

    "speech": "Today I have introduced a bill which seeks to make available surplus stocks of Commodity Credit Corporation rice to certain departments of the Government. The purpose of this legislation is to encourage the increased use of rice by our Armed Forces and various other Federal institutions by permitting them. when they have used their usual quantities of this wholesome food to so certify to the Commodity Credit Corporation and to receive such additional supplies of rice as they can use in that particular year. The bill would not interfere with the normal consumption of rice by the Armed Forces or these other Federal institutions nor would it interfere with the normal channels of trade. But it would be an incentive for these Institutions to make greater use of rice and provide added nourishment to its personnel. The domestic consumption of rice is estimated to be about 27.5 million hundredweight. This domestic consumption has been more or less stationary and we now have about 10 million hundredweight of rice held in CCC stocks. The purpose of this bill is to reduce those stocks and to acquaint more of our citizens with the delicious and nutritious grain that is the basic diet for more than twothirds of the world. It would result in reduced storage costs to the Government. increased mealunits for our Armed Forces and Federal institutions at very little added cost. and it will spread the acceptance of rice in a manner that should increase the domestic consumption of rice to a point that this grain will no longer be listed as a surplus commodity. Such a program. if effective. can assist In preventing a further drastic curtailment in rice acreages that have plagued our rice farmers and our agricultural communities for the past several years. The bill would extend the milk program policy to include rice. another surplus agricultural commodity and encourage its expanded consumption. The bill should be enacted. I would like to attach a table with respect to the supply and disposition of rice under certain assumptions. The table follows: Rice- Determination of normal supply and national acreage allotment for the 1959 crop using varying levels of assumed exports [In thousand hundredweight] (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10)",

There would be appropriations. adequate appropriations. there will be research and development. there will be the giving of information. imparting of certain information to our allies in NATO.

There have been arguments back and forth as to the meaning of section 5 (a) and section 22. There have been arguments back and forth as to whether the Government will lose money or make money. and as to the merits of section 22. The very confusion which exists here today is ample reason why we should have some committee guidance and direction on this very complicated subject. The reason we are not getting committee guidance and instruction is that a bill providing merely for a report to the Interstate Commerce Commission was passed by the Senate. That was what was presented to the House. The railroad company lost its lawsuit. and. as railroads have done so frequently. it comes to Congress and tries to have a law enacted. in order to win its lawsuit before the legislative body. when it should fight it out in the courts. Let us talk about some of the issues in dispute.",

Here we have a very highly controversial bill. involving one of the most complicated subjects in the entire American economy. that of freight rates. on which hearings were held for several weeks. and we are asked to take up the bill and consider it without having been able to secure a copy of the hearings and read them. The members of the Committee on Interstate Commerce may have had the hearings available. and may have had an opportunity to hear the witnesses themselves. The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Reed] is familiar with these subjects by virtue of his long background in dealing with publicutility matters. Mr. President. this bill affects my State. It affects litigation which the Supreme Court of the United States has permitted my State to file in that Court. and which has been referred to a master for determination. In view of the fact that I have not been able even to secure copies of the hearings. to see what the witnesses submitted in behalf of my State. I certainly feel justified in using any means at my command which are legal to see that the bill is not passed by the Senate. or taken up for consideration. in view of the fact that we have had no opportunity whatever to read the hearings. I appreciate the fact that the Senator from Kentucky has made that point clear. I ask the Senate in all seriousness. how often and to what extent are we to constitute ourselves into a supreme court in order to take away from the court litigation which has gone there properly under the law. in order that we may cut the ground out from under the Supreme Court in determining what is the law in regard to these situations?

Congress is asked to enact a law passing upon the question in advance of the courts having an opportunity to pass upon it. I think it is a vicious practice. I think it is a vicious habit. it ought never to have been indulged in. It seems to me that for the Congress to start out on the career of undertaking to nullify lawsuits. undertaking to set itself up an a master in chancery in the Supreme Court to determine what are the rights of these litigants. is an unjustified invasion of the jurisdiction of the court.",

The conference report does more than merely bring section 22 under the Bulwinkle Act. The Bulwinkle Act prescribes standards. The bill also has retroactive application. It applies to something that was done prior to the effective date of this paragraph. Therefore. under the bill the railroads can get their price after the contract has been performed. Retroactively. after it has been negotiated. they can get their price. without public notice. and without any of the standards set forth in the ReedBulwinkle Act. All they do is simply file with the ICC what they have done. and they are immunized from the application of the antitrust laws. On the question of whether the Government will lose any money. I should like to say that. In the first place. the Interstate Commerce Commission itself has said that for the years 1950 to 1954. section 22 rates were 13 percent higher than the regular commercial rates. Mr. Earl B. Smith. the Director for Transportation and Petroleum Logistics of the Defense Department. testified to that effect on April 16. 1957.",

We are not arguing the merits of the ReedBulwinkle Act. Perhaps we should. The fact is that Congress passed that act in 1948 by a twothirds vote of both Houses. There is no doubt in the mind of most people. certainly not in the mind of the Interstate Commerce Commission. and certainly not in the mind of the Defense Department or the Atomic Energy Commission. that the protection given by the ReedBulwinkle Act applies not merely to commercial shippers and people in ordinary business. but to Government rates under section 22 as well. The first time we ever had an idea that there was any question about such immunity was when. on July 5 of this year. the District Court of the District of Columbia entered its order. In view of that order. we must take some action. Why must we do so? If we do not do it. the railroads and the motor carriers and the water carriers can say. \"We can no longer do business with the Government under section 22. If we do. we will be subjecting ourselves to further lawsuits.\" The only thing we are trying to achieve is to put ourselves back in the status quo until such time. possibly. as some Senators who are so much interested in fighting monopoly introduce a bill to hit directly the question of the repeal of the ReedBulwinkle Act. I ask the Senator from Tennessee to give me his attention on this point. because I wish to say to him that he has inferred we are carrying the banner of the railroads.

How much? We know it will be $120 million for 1956. It will be $120 million for 1955. It will be $120 million for 1954. Consider the Korean war. it will be $200 million or $300 million.

Because. I believe the results of this survey are so revealing and important. I wish to bring them to the attention of my colleagues. It is generally agreed that governmentFederal. State. and localneeds competent. talented people in orde. to properly staff its many services. The civil service of any government is no better than the qualities of the people employed by the government. It is to be regretted that young people have very little interest In working for government. If such a condition continues. it whl mean that future recruits in the civil service will be less competent and less dedicated to public service. I call to the attention of the Senate that the survey revealed that more than 54 percent of the boys and 45 percent of the girls listed low wages as the major drawback of Government employment. Twentynine percent of the boys and 31 percent of the girls felt that working for the Government meant surrendering to certain restrictions on selfexpression. Twentythree percent of the boys and 27 percent of the girls said that one of the reasons they never gave a thought to working for the Government is that seldom did they hear about Government job opportunities.

He gave his service to his country in uniform and later in public life. and I think it might appropriately be said that he gave his life for his country and died in line of duty. Shortly before his passing I had the great privilege of being with him in Tennessee at a meeting called to further the interests of west Tennessee and west Kentucky. at which time he was. as usual. endeavoring to be of serviee to his constituency. JERE COOPER has left a challenge to others to carry on for the benefit of humanity and has left virtues long to exist. carved on the tablets of love and memory. In his passing the Nation has lost a great statesman. his family a devoted brother. and I a good friend.

University of Wisconsin scientists and dairymarketing experts announced that the university had perfected a longhoped for process for making a greatly improved concentrated. sterilized milk. Thanks to this process. a milk product will. we hope. shortly become available to the Nations housewives in cans which can be easily and inexpensively purchased. and which can be kept on the shelf for many months with or without refrigeration. It is the hope of this dairy industry that this new development may provide at least some of the answers for increased sales of fluid milk and for an increased share. to the dairymen. of the consumers milk dollar. I need hardly remind my colleagues that this development comes at a time of severe crisis for the dairy industry. Not only is the dairymens income down. but it may go down still further in the event Secretary of Agriculture Benson proceeds with his unfortunate plans for slashing of milk supports on April 1. Naturally. my own State of Wisconsin is especially affected by the critical dairy situation. Dairying. to Wisconsin. represents 17 billion pounds of milk produced annually. It represents a hundred thousand dairy farms. two and a third million milk cows. 1.600 dairy plants. Dairying represents 550 million pounds of Wisconsin cheese. 240 million pounds of butter. 20 million gallons of ice cream. and 500 million pounds of powdered milk. But dairying also represents. despite all of the heavy cash investment represented in it. a meager return to the farmer of but 40 to 50 cents on the average per hour of labor. as compared with city wages of 4 and 5 times that total. I send to the desk the text of a writeup which appeared in the November 1957 issue of the Pure Milk Products Press describing the welcome concentrated canned milk development.

But I am beginning to have serious misgivings about Formosa in the administration of the funds allocated to this area. It is no longer a fiction but a fact that Chiang ChingKuo. son of the Generalissimo. is the strong man and wields more power behind the scenes in Formosa than is realized. The power that he wields far transcends the nominal posts he holds in the Nationalist Chinese Government. The police and security forces of Formosa seem to be virtually under his control. The fact that the American Embassy and USIA offices in Taipei were wrecked on May 24. 1957. by Chinese rioters was because the man who had the power to deter the attacks apparently did not do much about it. The humiliation of the American flag. Insult to its Government officials. and the destruction of American properties began their ignominious course in a supposedly friendly country. Nationalist China. whose government owes its very life to the support given by the United States Government. As I understand that Chiang ChingKuo was trained and indoctrinated in Russia for many years. therefore. one cannot help but wonder what is his real intention and where his loyalty lies. In light of this we certainly should not squander away our aid into the hands of someone in whom we do not have full confidence. I am very glad to see that the Congress of the United States has adopted an amendment concerning the Chinese Nationalist Government to this effect. in which we frowned upon the idea of using some of this money for pensions and some of the things it is being used for in Formosa. It shows that probably I am not the only one who entertains these views. I believe that next year. when the appropriation bill is before us. we had better take a long look. not as to the policy of giving money to Formosa or to the Nationalist Government. but to the way it is being administered over there. I believe it calls for some searching inquiry.",

These amounts are not even submitted to the host countriesthey are made up by our own people. For instance. the economy of Korea has progressed to the extent where it is now better than it has ever been. Why should it not be? We have spent in Korea. for economic aid alone. in the last 5 years. $1.174.485.000. Korea is a country which has made progress. But instead of tapering off our program of assistance to Korea we have increased it considerably. I am not permitted to tell the Senate the amount. The Senator from California mentioned Pakistan. In Pakistan we have spent $267.625.000. This measure provides quite a sum more to help Pakistan. That is being done notwithstanding the opposition of India and Afghanistan to our assistance to Pakistan. Mr. President. this money does not do the job that my good friend the Senator from California states it does. I can state frankly and candidly that this sum of money can easily be trimmed. If it is. no one will miss the amount that is eliminated. because the amount we are now providing gives those countries the same amount they received last year. Today their situation is improving. Their economies are much better. They are producing more. As I said awhile ago. it seems to me that the more we help their economies. the more we improve them and improve them and improve them. the more money they demand and the more money we send them. I am getting sick and tired of doing that. particularly when the money we use for this program is borrowed. Therefore. Mr. President. I hope the amendment will be agreed to.",

Mr. President. it is indeed a very sad thing to contemplate that this program has become a permanent part of our Government. I know of no way by which we shall ever get rid of this foreignassistance program. In times past. I undertook to point out that when we have an entrenched bureaucracy which makes up its own budget estimates and requests. it almost becomes permanent. In addition. we now have the vested Interest in the foreignaid program by those who sell their goods to the agencies which purchase them for delivery abroad. A great many of them are powerful interests in this country. They have reached the stage where they obtain much more in the way of profits from the goods they sell to the foreignaid program than the amount of the taxes they have to pay to support it. So in this way. they are protected. But by virtue of that vested interest. the average taxpayer is being saddled in perpetuity with the cost of a program which the Congress should begin to pare down. But the recipients have received it for so long that they think we cannot reduce it. they say that if we reduce it. we shall lose our friends. Thus we see the vested interest of a bureaucracy which makes up its own budget estimates. and has no one to argue against them. when it presents to the Congress its budget estimates. the vested interests who produce everything from magazines to tanks. and therefore support the program. in the political arena. with all their powerful means of communication. and. then. the vested interests on the part of the recipients. who now tell us. \"If you reduce it by one dime. we will leave you.\" Mr. President. I am sad when I contemplate increasing this program over that allowed last year. If the program is increased. the day when that is done will be a tragic one for the taxpayers of the United States.",

This program would have cost only $75 million a year for 5 years through 1962. when it was expected that the increased domestic and foreign consumption would have stabilized the minerals market. Many of us who supported this measure did so reluctantly. because we have felt. and still feel. that the tariff route is preferable to subsidies. But the leadzinc industry has been depressed for 8 years. and it had gone the full route of tariff investigations on two occasions. with unanimous recommendations of the Tariff Commission that escapeclause relief be provided. In view of these circumstances. the Senate voted overwhelming support70 to 12for passage of this measure. and it seemed that relief was. at long last. in sight. However. as we well know. our colleagues in the House have just harpooned this measure with a 23vote margin. and it appears quite definite that effective relief via this alternative route cannot be provided this session. Under these circumstances. it appears that the President has no alternative other than to invoke tariff increases and import quotas for lead and zinc under the escape clause of the Trade Agreements Act. as recommended in a stillpending action of the Tariff Commission. And I and many other Members of Congress from mineralsproducing States have importuned him to take such action. At this point. Mr. President.

The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania had filed an amendment to raise It to $625 million. I deeply believe the Appropriations Committee went as far as it felt it could go in terms of the temper of the most of the Members of the Senate in fixing the figure at $580 million. I believe that is a fair figure in view of the fact that the administration asked for only $625 million. whereas it should have asked. based upon the testimony of Douglas Dillon himself. for $825 million. But it did not. That is its mistake. In any event. considering what the Appropriations Committee faced. I believe it handled the matter very fairly.

She had the capacity to edify all who knew her by her charming manner Arizona is a better place because Mrs. Marshall lived with us. and all of us mourn her passing: A GRAcIous LADY Funeral services for Mrs. Lois I. Marshall. widow of Thomas R. Marshall. Vice President of this country under Woodrow Wilson. will be held here tomorrow. Mrs. Marshall was a kindly. gracious. unassuming lady. She never sought the limelight. even in the days when her husband was a Vice President of the Nation. She never attempted to presume on the fact that she was married to a Vice President. either durIng her husbands term of office. or later. Mrs. Marshall and her husband first came to Arizona 42 years ago. They came to Scotsdale where the Marshalls later built a winter home. During the period when her husband was in office in Washington. Vice Presidents were looked upon like little boys. they could be seen. but never heard. Mrs. Marshall conformed to the pattern through choice rather than rule. She once told a reporter who asked for a political comment that there were smarter people in Washington \"than I am. and they dont seem to have the answers.\" All those who knew her or knew of her will regret the passing of a lovely lady.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the most important editorials that I have read in recent months is the brilliant critique of the Presidents budget offered by the editors of the Washington Post in this mornings edition. The Post editorial opens with the blunt declaration that \"the Presidents budget does not measure up to the challenge of the times.\" Recognizing the concern which we all share in the problem of inflation. the Post editor warns against even greater dangers to our way of life which the Presidents budget requests seem to gloss over. The editorial continues: But freedom has other enemies just now. in the sagging American educational base and other unmet domestic needs no less than In the global military and economic efforts of the Soviet Union. Measured against these challenges and against the untapped capacities of this country for hard work and sacrifice. what the President proposes is in many ways a retrenchment and. we fear. a flight from reality. The inadequacy of the Presidents proposals are pointed up by the strange fact that he is actually calling for a reduction in total appropriations for 1959 of some $2 billion below the amount sought for the current fiscal year. Drawing attention to the fact that Mr. Eisenhower seems to have forgotten about the works of peace that he discussed with such enthusiasm in his state of the Union message last week. the Post editor points out that the President seems to regard military defense as an end in itself. \"What is it that we are trying to protect?\" bsks the editorial. Can we really buy national security by neglecting vital public programs here at home and adopting an unimaginative approach to economic problems abroad? I urge a careful reading of the Posts answer to these questions that now confront us all. The editorial follows:",

There is one final point I want to emphasize. and I cannot emphasize it too strongly. I tried to emphasize it in my interrogation of the Secretary of the Treasury. When he talked about this depression that is going to curl your hair. he talked about the longrange viewpoint. Essentially what he was saying is what I am saying right now. If we continue this high rate of taxation. do we think we are going to solve this problem we have of tight money? There is no tight money as far as the consumer dollar is concerned. the tight money lies in the area of the investment dollar. and the investment dollar comes only from the savings of our people. One reason that our people cannot save the money that is necessary in order to provide additional capital for investment is our tax structure. Let me give you one example and you figure it out. Today it requires $14.000 of capital investment to provide a job for one man. That. understandably. is increasing in amount as technology increases and the requirement for better machines. As better machines come along productivity increases. so we have to generate that much more savings. To put 1 million additional men to work a year. and that is just about the rate they are coming into the labor market. means an additional capital investment of $14 billion annually just to hold our own. and it is to this area that I am addressing my attention. Unless we do something about our basic tax structure which includes tax base. includes tax rate. includes this factor of collectibility.. we are going to find ourselves in a position where although the gross national product is increasing 3 percent annually. and did increase last year 3 percent. the amount of the anticipated revenue from the corporate tax is only onehalf of one percent. In other words. we are not getting out of our growing economy the kind of tax take that we normally should from that amount of growth. The error lies. I suggest. in this rate feature.",

This reason has been nonexistent for several years. Eliminating certificates of necessity is a method of broadening the tax base. just as is the plugging of any tax loophole.

Now. for 3 years I have been asking that a study be made as best we could on how well we are enforcing the $10.50agallon tax. The figures that I have seen. and they are hard to come by. of the amount of bootlegging going on indicates that there is revenue that we are completely losing.

I remember on the excessprofits tax. the argument in favor of a continuation of that tax was that we needed the revenue. I tried to argue at the time that I thought we would gain more revenue through the elimination of that tax by gaining it from the application of the regular corporation tax. Now. it is always hard to prove those things. but it is certainly true that the amount of tax that we realized from the regular corporate tax after the excessprofits tax expired was greater than the combination of the corporate tax plus the excessprofits tax before. It seemed to me that that was a cause and effect situation. In that instance again. by eliminating a rate we actually increased the \"take\" because we had gone beyond the point of diminishing returns. Secretary HumiPHaxy. You are in a field in which you can get into a lot of difficulty. It is extremely hard to measure these things. You are saying in a way what I have said repeatedly for the last several days. That is. that if we maintain our levels so high that we deplete our capital investment. ultimately we will not collect so much tax because the country will not produce so much. But you know perfectly well that if you cut your taxes a third or a half today. you would reduce your income today. Now. maybe 10 years from now you would be getting more. Because of that fact. I do not think that you could say that you were perfectly willing to go ahead and take a great big loss today. You have to measure them out.",

I recognize. however. the necessity for closed rules and I do recognize the members on the Committee on Ways and Means as being among the most competent Members of the House and the hardest working. I know it is very urgent that they keep the Governments hands in the taxpayers pockets. because the Government needs the money. . They got Uncle Sams hands a little too deep into the pockets of some of my people. and took a little money that should not have been taken. I wish the Committee on Ways and Means would help me get it back for my people. There are two precedents for the bill I am speaking of. I wanted to offer it as an amendment to the pending bill or in a motion to recommit. I understand there is going to be a straight motion to recommit and I cannot get it in that way. so I hope the Committee on Ways and Means will cooperate with me and help me get this bill out and get it passed. I say there are two precedents for this * bill. It was at one time law. but when H. R. 8300 was written. inadvertently this provision was left out of the bill. The other precedent is that last year I called the bill up by unanimous consent and got it through the House. and got it tacked onto a tax bill in the Senate. but that bill never got to conference until after Congress adjourned. The bill simply makes the depletion allowance equitable for all those people who are now exempt from the mineral depletion. some of them on the accounting year and some of them on the fiscal year. Those on the calendar year get a full years exemption and those on the fiscal year only a part of a year. This enables those people on the fiscal year to have the same exemption for that particular year and the same exemption they are getting now that those on the calendar year had.

Secondly. on this comment by the gentleman from New York that Poland is now a completely dominated Communist nation. dominated by Soviet Russia. I believe from my knowledge of the facts as a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. that is not correct. As a matter of fact. since the events that took place last October in Poland. Poland has been able economically to stand up and take a bargaining position with Russia and say that she will not sell Russia any more coal at 90 percent below world market prices. and that Russia must now give Poland equivalent value of products based on the world market prices. So. this means that Poland will save approximately $600 million in the next few years by her ability to stand up. So. by this bill we are really sustaining Polands independent position in her dealings with other Communist nations. May I further say that the agencies of the Catholic Church recommended their members in Poland to support the election by Gomulko and Cardinal Wyszynski has been released by the present government. Ninetyfive percent of the fine Polish people are Catholics to this day. and freedom of religion has been restored in Poland. While I am an American.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this a very important matter. I listened with great care to the remarks made by the gentleman from Missouri . I agree with him that this matter of fiscal responsibility and Congressional control over public funds is a basic matter. In many other ways the executive branch of the Government has eluded Congressional control and regulations and we are losing the constitutional authority that we ought to exercise for the benefit of the people of the country. In this connection I call attention to the report of the Hardy committee. Report No. 449. 85th Congress. filed with the House on May 15. 1957. entitled \"Review of the Budget Formulation and Presentation Practices of the International Cooperation Administration.\" The Hardy committee was concerned that the International Cooperation Administration in making its request for authority before the Foreign Affairs Committee and for funds before the Appropriations Committee was very vague and uncertain in the presentation and the representations of what they intended to do with the authority and the money if they were granted by Congress. That vagueness made it impossible for our Committee on International Operations to review the performance of the agency. because it had made no promise against which you could judge performance. I call attention to the discussion of this very subject. Public Law 480. on pages 13 and 14 of the committee report. I believe that discussion. showing the lack of information given to the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Appropriations Committee with respect to the anticipated use of counterpart funds arising from Public Law 480. amply demonstrates that in this instance we in Congress have lost control over public funds. I think the House ought to consider this matter very. very seriously.",

Under Public Law 480. there is not any way in the world that anyone can tell how the funds have been used. Congress has no control whatever over them because the executive department is permitted to make the contracts. There is no way that anybody can tell what has been done with the money after they have spent it under the agreements. I have reviewed the breakdown that the gentleman from North Carolina proposes to put in the RECORD. but the figures do not mean anything. I defy any. body to find out for what purposes these funds are being used. They have a statement here \"Loans for multilateral trade and economic development $1.164.7 million.\" But there is no breakdown of that and nobody in the Congress has any breakdown for it. If you ask the departments about it. you will not find out what has been done. The gentleman knows. I am sure. that a lot of these funds have been used to pay for host country participation in technical assistance programs. So they have taken the money generated by our agricultural commodities. There are a good many cases where these funds have been used for purposes which certainly the Congress knew nothing about. and it is very doubtful whether the Congress would approve. Actually. my own point of view is that if these funds are going to be used in this manner. then the foreign aid program ought to be reduced by the amount of these funds.",

I go down the middle of the road.

The constant bickering and fighting that goes on within the party is the one point that discourages me more than anything else. Naturally. I have no part in that. Let me read: I have yet to see in the newspapers any public disagreement in the Democratic Party In the State of Michigan although I am certain they have as many divergent elements as we have. Insofar as the general public is concerned they present a solid and united front. Mr. Speaker. opposition political unity In Michigan is due in part to the fact that the CIO and the Reuthers have taken the Democratic Party organization over. Reuther and his buddies strike with an iron and ruthless handand do notwill not brook opposition. Unfortunately in view of the tax plans of Governor Williams and Reuthers attitude toward business. management. and industry. all of whom he seems to hate. he and Soapy are. in a way. driving industry out of Michigan.

    "speech": "Mr. President. my rebuttal to the Senator from Pennsylvania will be very brief. With respect to the obligation of the Senate to pass legislation. I certainly do not think we should pass illogical legislation. I know of no tenet of law which supports illogical principles of law. It is one of the obligations of the courts. in the administration of justice. to apply causetoeffect and effecttocause reasoning. That means. of course. the following of a logical system in the administration of justice. In regard to the claim that we should engage in the type of compromise which is involved in this proposal. I referred to that matter when I spoke earlier about the conference procedures of Congress. The conference committee is the place for ironing out or hammering out on the anvil of conscionable compromise differences between the two bodies. I take the position that it is our legislative function to pass legislation which we recognize to be good legislation. Now. a word about the civic bodies. Take a look at the hearings. Read what the witnesses said. Many of the witnesses representing the civic organizations were going along with this bill. not because they approved of it. not because it was the bill of their preference. but because they had been sold the bill of goods that this measure was the only hope they had for anything which even had a label of \"home rule\" attached to it. I do not think it is sound rebuttal to my position to say that this bill is the bill which the civic organizations want. Rather. one who will look at the record of the hearings cannot escape the conclusion that their position is very well summarized by saying. \"We will take this bill because. apparently. it is the best bill we can get.\" We in the Senate have the duty to fight for the citizens of the District of Columbia to get them a better bill. That is the position which I took throughout the debate on this matter. With regard to this being a legislative homerule bill. the citizens of the District of Columbia have no legislative rights. The bill provides that the territorial governor can override the territorial legislature. If the territorial legislature then overrides the veto of the territorial governor. the President of the United States can override the territorial legislature.",

To this country. it is evidence of the wisdom of maintaining a firm policy of justice toward all nations. It justifies the confidence the people of the country have in the Presidents conduct of foreign policy. The withdrawal under the honorable conditions which have reportedly been arranged makes it possible for this Nation to continue its friendly and close relations with the country of Israel which it helped create. These conditions are based on justice and equity. and I am confident that the Arab nations. too. will realize that this is true. Israel has done its full part. The responsibility now rests squarely on the Arab nations. A renewal of the dispute cannot do either side any real good. Now we must move forward and seek to eliminate the root causes of the continuing conflict and confusion in the Middle East. The Presidents Middle East resolution is the next essential step. and the militaryeconomic aid sections of the proposed legislation are critical to the success of the joint resolution. Without this. our Nation will be hindered in achieving its goal of helping all the nations in the Middle East to resist communism and to enjoy the fruits of a durable peace and economic progress. The economic aid section of the joint resolution especially can help meet the basic problems of the area which must be settled if we are to get away from the situation of moving from crisis to crisis. and if we are to make real progress toward lasting peace. President Eisenhowers Middle East resolution can be the forerunner for a cooperative program of economic development which all the nations of the area can. with our help. carry forward to their mutual benefit. I feel that with the withdrawal of the Israeli forces and with the forthcoming enactment of President Eisenhowers Middle East resolution. there is finally a real chance to achieve lasting peace in this vital part of the world.

We have attained a business in exports which represents approximately 5 percent of the gross national product of the United States. and that 5 percent is a very important factor to many. many companies in the United States. We have developed. in connection with exports. business which it is estimated employs 41/2 million people. This has become a very vital matter to the United States. More than that. Mr. President. in this day and age. with communications so excellent and travel so easy. and with a battle raging between the Free World and the Communist nations of it world. it is absolutely essential. in my view. that we do what we can to improve the trade relations among the free countries of the world. Trade will bring these countries closer together. and increase their confidence in each other and their dependence upon each other. Trade will thus bring the free nations closer together spiritually. politically and socially. which I think will be greatly to the advantage of the United States in the long run. Mr. President. I intend to support amendments to the bill which will extend the Trade Agreements Act for 5 years rather than 3 years. which the committee recommends. and amendments which will restore to the bill the House provision in connection with escape clause proceedings and appeals therefrom. I think these matters are of vital importance to the United States.",

I should like to associate myself with the remarks which have been made by the distinguished. Senator from Connecticut. I know many of us are in accord with the statement which was made by Secretary of Commerce Weeks. that the committee bill would \"completely emasculate the legislation\" proposed by the administration. - know many Senators want to support amendments which will make the bill effective and in accordance with the proposal submitted by the President. We have complete confidence in our colleagues on the committee who have attempted to make the hill effective. We want to support our colleagues. We want to have the chance to support them. I express the hope that the administration will not agree to compromises which will make the act ineffective. I believe if the bill is passed in the form in which it has been submitted by the Senate Committee on Finance it will be a sham Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. Undoubtedly the most damaging amendment written by the committee is the socalled escapeclause amendment. which would in effect make the President a figurehead. This amendment alone would emasculate the Trade Agreements Act. All of us have problems concerning industries in our States. We have had to make the decision that the act in the long run is best for the country. That is the decision we have made. I hope that there will be no compromises. I hope we shall have a chance to restore the bill to its original form. I join with my friend from Connecticut in support of his position.",

I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Kentucky in vigorously opposing the amendments which the Committee on Finance has recommended to the bill as passed by the House of Representatives. As the Senator from Kentucky said. I think the most harmful of the amendments is that relating to the socalled escape clause. under which it would be necessary. if the President wished to make a determination different from the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. to have his determination supported by a majority vote of both Houses. This. I think. would effectually tie the hands of the President. and render practically nugatory the whole mechanism of the reciprocal trade program. I agree equally with respect to the limitation of 3 years instead of 5 years. as approved by the House of Representatives. and the provision which would limit to 5 percent a year. noncumulative. the reduction which might be made. instead of the cumulative authority voted by the House which would make possible a total reduction of 25 percent and which could be applied at rates up to 10 percent a year. These things. as has been stated. ought to be done at this time. particularly in view of the fact that the European Common Market is now getting under way. It is essential for this country to be able to work into a freer and more flexible pattern of trade with the countries of that union. If the President is not given at least the power provided by the House of Representatives in the bill the House passed. the whole program may well collapse. Again I express my vigorous concurrence with the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Kentucky on these matters.",

I wonder if people in high places realize what the Soviet threat in this area truly means. I am beginning to wonder if anybody reads what is written about it.

As might have been expected. the administration has been deaf to protests made to the President. for the Presidential order was announced suddenly and without prior consultation so far as I know. with responsible Members of the Congress. It had all the earmarks of a fixed position unlikely to be changed by mere entreaties. That is why I welcomed the introduction of proposed legislation by the junior Senator from Michigan [Mr. MCNAMARAJ to provide for an independent regulatory board to administer the seaway. and why I joined in cosponsoring this important measure. Mr. President. such a regulatory board would be at least as independent of administration pressures as the other regulatory agencies. such as the CAB. the FCC and the FTC. Granted that these agencies have not functioned as independently of the White House as the Congress would desire. but it is to be hoped that the independence of the regulatory agencies as a group will be strengthened by the current inquiries being made by the Congress. At any rate. the establishment of a regulatory agency is the most promising proposal to keep the St. Lawrence Seaway free from political and economic interests opposing its efficient operation. and I strongly urge that hearings be scheduled on this proposed legislation at the earliest possible moment. prior to the final determination of the toll schedules for the seaway.

I think one who is going to fill this important position of judge of the juvenile court certainly ought to have 5 years of residence here immediately before being appointed.

This exemption shall apply only with respect to sales taking place on and after January 1. 1957. The District of Columbia Sales Tax Act provides that a \"semipublic institution means any corporation. and any community chest. fund. or foundation organized exclusively for religious. scientific. charitable. or educational purposes. including hospitals. no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. For the purpose of this title an organization or institution which does not embrace the generally recognized relationship of teacher and student shall be deemed not to be operated for educational purposes.\" There is no provision in the Sales Tax Act for the exemption of a transaction made between two nonexempt parties because the transaction takes place on Government ground or because the property involved may be located on Government ground. The Office of the Assessor. Sales and Use Tax Division. has determined that these organizations do not comply with the Sales Tax Act as organizations organized exclusively for religious. scientific. charitable. or educational purposes. and therefore they would have to pay a sales tax on the sale of materials to be used for war memorials in the District of Columbia. This bill would exempt such sales from the District of Columbia Sales Tax Act. The loss in revenue to the District of Columbia is so small that it was impossible to estimate what it would really amount to. The bill has the approval of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia. The bill was ordered to be read the third time. was read the third time. and passed. and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.",

I happen to be chairman of the Fiscal Affairs Subcommittee of the Committee on the District of Columbia. Last year we enacted a pretty comprehensive District incometax law in which we raised the income taxes on citizens of the District of Columbia to a very great degree. In reviewing the operation of that bill this year it became apparent. as it would in any bill as comprehensive as that. that there were some inadvertent things in the bill. that pretty obviously needed correcting. With that end in view we held a hearing on those items. This bill is designed to bring the District income tax law into line with the Federal incometax law. There are several discrepancies here where the District law allows a smaller exemption or no exemption ift certain areas. where the Federal law allows an exemption. You will find. therefore. that practically all of this bill is devoted to correcting those things. For instance. allowing an exemption to the blind. increasing certain other exemptions from $500 to $1.000. bringing it into conformity with the Federal law. The gentlemans remark about reducing taxes is very pertinent but let me say to the gentleman that by reason of this law that we enacted last year we increased the collections for the District of Columbia by an amount that runs into $16 million. These corrections that we are making we think are just and should be made. The total reduction estimated by the Commissioners is that it will be around $300.000.",

I have had compiled some figures on the amount of money expended for investigations. The present resolution provides for an increase of $250.000 for the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. That committee on February 7 was given $100.000. It is now proposed to increase that to $350.000. Here is something that surely is of interest to all Members of the House. The House of the 85th Congress has already authorized expenditures of more than $212 million for investigations. This Congress is only a little over 3 months old. Undoubtedly there will be considerable additional money requested for investigations. Probably by far the greater part of the money that will be needed has already been authorized. but it would be strange. indeed. if we did not have to have some additional money for some of the committees that are conducting investigations. This sum of $2.569.500 is somewhat more than all of the money that was expended for investigations in the 83d Congress. I do not have before me figures as to other previous Congresses. but prior to the 83d Congress I am certain that the amounts were substantially less. In the 83d Congress there were special committees and special investigations on conditions in the Baltic States. investigation of taxexempt foundations. investigation of campaign expenditures. and so forth. But the total amount then expended still is not as much as the amount that we have already authorized up to this time in the 85th Congress. I submit to the membership of the House that it looks as though we are going pretty far in the matter of spending money for investigations. I feel that we could give the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce an added amount of perhaps $100.000 and if we find good use has been made of it and more is needed for needed investigations. we could consider another authorization from the contingent fund of the House.",

At the present time existing laws relating to the subject of plant pest control do not provide the authority to regulate the movement of plant diseases as such. or diseasebearing organisms. or certain plant pests which can injure or cause disease or damage in plants or their products.

This will have the effect of permitting the Department to undertake eradication or control campaigns against pests related to those named without requiring. in each case. an amendment to the act. H. R. 3476 was unanimously reported with several minor and the one major amendment by the Committee on Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture favors the enactment of this measure.

So the committee sought a method to make it clear that the delay was not such delay as would cause such infraction of the law or rules of criminal procedure. Therefore. the committee inserted the word \"reasonable\" before the word \"delay.\" That was the only amendment which the Senate made in the House bill. The House receded from its disagreement to the Senate amendment. The House accepted the Senate amendment \"reasonable\" but asked that there be added to the bill another clause. which would define what was meant. This clause. I want the Senate to understand. was the work of Senate conferees and House conferees. It was the work of Senate conferees. some of whom were Republican. and some of whom were Democrats. It was the work of House conferees. some of whom were Democrats and some of whom were Republicans. So the clause which I am about to read to the Senate is the work of the conferees of both Houses and the work of bipartisan conferees. The clause reads as follows: Provided. That such delayMeaning \"such reasonable delay\"is to be considered as an elementWhich means. of course. among other elementsin determining the voluntary or involuntary nature of such statements or confessions. Let me read that provision again. so that it may appear in one uninterrupted sentence: Provided. That such delay is to be considered as an element in determining the voluntary or involuntary nature of such statements or confessions.

In other words. we have. on behalf of the Senate conferees and on behalf of the House conferees. preserved the Senate amendment. which does not in any way or form reverse the Mallory decision by the Supreme Court. This is not a criticism of the Supreme Court. It does not reverse the misapplication of the Mallory decision in the court of appeals in the District of Columbia. If there were any doubt about that. it would be dismissed immediately by the language used by Judge Burger. of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. when he agreed with those who wrote the opinion to reverse the 3 convictions in 3 separate courts in the Trilling case. Judge Burger said. In his brief opinion. that he thought the language of Judge Prettyman. who wrote the opinion asking for the affirmation of the conviction. stated what ought to be the law. But he felt that he was compelled by the Mallory decision to vote otherwise. In other words. the judge made a plain confession that he was voting against his better judgment as to what the law ought to be because of his interpretation of the Mallory decision. He said the rulemaking authority ought to review this matter. and furthermore. that perhaps Congress should do it. The opportunity is here for Congress to do it. Is there a reason why?

Subsequently. it was charged by the Senator from Indiana that the Senator from Massachusetts had violated some great rule of secrecy which. supposedly. should exist. and. supposedly. should apply when a Senator stands on the floor of the Senate to warn the people of America that all is not going well with our national defense. When the discussion was continued again Thursday night. and some of the same statements were made in the debate that the Senator from Massachusetts had made in his speech earlier in the day on Thursday. it was suggested that rule XXXV be invoked. the galleries be cleared. and the Senate go into a closeddoor session.

    "speech": "I thank the Senator from Florida very much for his kind remarks. I am offering the amendment to rule XXXV tonight because of the principle I have enunciated so many times in my speeches in the Senate during the past 14 years. namely. that in a democracy there is no substitute for full public disclosure of the peoples business. I believe. Mr. President. that national defense is the peoples business. and if the national defense is not going well. the American people should know of it. Disclosing the facts. no matter how ugly they may be. in my opinion. does not in any way jeopardize the security of this Nation. I wish to refer now to the documents printed in the RECORD yesterday by the Senator from Massachusetts . The Senator invited attention. for example. to a statement of Secretary of Defense McElroy. Secretary of Defense McElroy said on November 15. 1957. in a press conference: \"We are behind the Russians in missile and satellite developments.\" Yet. when the Senator from Massachusetts brought that out on the floor of the Senate by other proof which he offered. it was suggested that in some way he was violating some sacred principle of secrecy involving the defenses of this country and that we ought to clear the galleries and go into session behind closed doors. It is the proposal I am objecting to. Surely. we could clear the galleries and go into executive session. and then by a vote overrule the objectors and go back into public session. This kind of procedure. throwing us into that kind of secret session. in my judgment has no place in a democracy. and should not be countenanced. The Senator from Massachusetts had printed in the RECORD some testimony involving one of the outstanding authorities in the field of atomic development. as follows: In the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee. on December 14. 1957. in response to questioning. Dr. Wernher von Braun (Director. Development Operations Division. Army Ballistics Missile Agency. Huntsville. Ala.) said.",

I close with this point. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and a former member of the Armed Services Committee. I know that there is information which must be kept secret for a time because its publication would give comfort to the enemy. But no such information was contained in the Kennedy speech.

Ga. I wish to state emphatically that our investigation of Communist influence in the South is totally unrelated to the matter of school integration or school segregation. The hearings in Georgia are conducted for the purpose of further tracing the inroads made by the Communist conspiracy in the ranks of certain legitimate organizations created by people of good will. Many leaders of those organizations are not aware of the fact that the Communist Party. reduced in size as a formal entity and placed under a spotlight by our investigations. is now engaged in infiltration and penetration of many groups. organizations. societies. and so forth. whose leaders are not informed of the identity of the highly skilled and trained agents of the Kremlin. masquerading behind a facade of humanitarianism. The good citizens who signed the open letter are not sufficiently informed of the extent of Communist penetration of the many organizations active in the South. The signers of the open letter would be well advised to study with a little more diligence the true character and purpose of the agents who hide behind their backs and whisper into their ears. Should the Kremlins agents succeed in exploiting the tension characteristic of the period of social changes occurring in the South. that area of the United States would soon become a rather dangerous place to live.

Let us take an objective look at the two issues which have been raised against Mr. BuRNs. First. he is attacked because he agreed to the original strategy under which Alaska went forward. on its own merits. with Hawaii waiting in the legislative wings for its own assured solo trip. I was one of the architects of that strategy. I believed it was the only possible way to achieve statehood for both because. in 1955. when the two were tied together. the bill was recommitted.",

Our strategy worked in spite of having the minority leader of the Republican Party. Mr. MARTIN. the Republican whip. Mr. ARENDS. and the chairman of the Republican Congressional Committee.

Our American press has been loud in its praise of the strategy used by opposing the linking of Hawaii and Alaska in one bill. Mr. Speaker.

I appreciate the action of the distinguished Senator from Virginia and his distinguished colleague and other Senators in attempting to secure reconsideration of the merits of the plans to extend the east front of the Capitol. The fine support given to those of us who are working on this matter by many newspapers and magazines has indeed been gratifying and has done much to arouse the concern of the Congress and the public throughout the country. On August 29. 1957. S. 2883 was introduced by me together with my colleague from New Jersey . and also the Senator from Pennsylvania . and the Senator from Minnesota . The purpose of this proposed legislation is to remove the handicap of the mandatory requirement adopted some years ago that any consideration of Capitol improvements must include the moving forward of the east front of the Capitol. The Senate Public Works Committee last Thursday gave their unanimous approval to S. 2883 and the bill is now on the Senate Calendar. Dealing with this matter from the standpoint of appropriations. the pending Robertson amendment supplements the efforts my colleagues and I have been making to postpone the letting of any contracts in order to give additional opportunity to reconsidering alternate plans for enlarging the Capitol Building to meet presentday needs and make the necessary repairs. I hope that Members of the Senate will support the Robertson amendment and will give full support to S. 2883 when it comes before this body. We have it within our power to rectify what many feel to be a grievous mistake in extending the east front of the Capitol.",

My understanding is that at the present time an appropriation of $17 million is available. and that there is an additional $25.6 million in contract authority. All the Commission has done is to authorize the expenditure of $17 million on the east front. no more and no less. The Commission has declared that it does not intend to spend $25.6 million. So far as I am concerned. the logical way to prevent any contract authorization from becoming effective would be by amending the legislative appropriation bill. when the Senate considers it this year. In other words. I believe the Senator is right. that if we are going to do anything to the Capitol we should do it one thing at a time. and know what we are doing. It is a good thing to do it that way. and it is the proper thing to do. I can see no harm in it. Beyond that there is no need to go until we have further information. Would it meet with the Senators desire that the additional authorization at least be canceled?",

I might add. the President is earnestly adjuring business and industry to hold the line against increasing joblessnessno less a source than the Federal Government itself is apparently making an appreciable contribution to the numbers of the Nations unemployed. In fact. Mr. President. on last Thursday. March 6. at almost the same time that the majority leader was introducing. for myself and some 18 of our colleagues. Senate Concurrent Resolutions 68 and 69. declaring it to be the sense of the Congress that there be an acceleration in those civil and military construction projects for which funds have already been appropriated in order to alleviate unemploymentthe Washingtion Post and Times Herald was reporting that \"Layoffs have started again in the Federal service. chiefly in defense agencies.\" According to the usually most reliable reporting of Mr. Jerry Kluttz. whose column. the Federal Diary. appears daily in the Washington Post: The numbers of jobless Federal employees being paid unemployment compensation reached 46.849 last week (the week of February 24. 1958) including the 2.852 new applicants. The record number on the unemployment rolls shows that laidoff Federal employees are no longer able to get other jobs. I have carefully checked Mr. Kluttz figures. Mr. President. and find them to be quite correct. Therefore. I ask unanimous consent that the article written by Mr. Kluttz be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

I wish. moreover. especially to point out that the figure of 46.849 unemployed Federal workers is more than double the number of 21.900 Government employees who were drawing unemployment compensation in the same period 1 year ago. That shows the condition which is developing. Thus. contrary to the common assumption. Federal employees seem to be less fortunately situated today than are their coworkers in private industry. For whereas total covered unemployment on a nationwide basis climbed to a peak of 3.268 million in this same week of February 24an alltime high since the unemployment insurance program was initiated in 1938this figure is still not quite double the 1.7 million who were drawing unemployment compensation in the like period of 1957. Moreover. according to Mr. Kluttzand again. I may say that my preliminary investigation of the situation shows him to be accurate-\"during this month of March about 50 agencies and installations have reported plans to discharge more than 3.000 employees. Unreported layoffs are expected to total at least another 1.000.\" While these figures. Mr. President. may not loom very large in proportion to the overall national figure. in federally impacted areas. where unemployment is already serious. they become staggering. They are also staggering to the families of the unfortunate Government workers who are facing protracted periods of hardship while their breadwinners remain jobless. It is my intention to go further into the causes and the validity of these layoffs. Entirely aside from the harmful effect upon national morale which such dismissals by the Federal Government must haveespecially at this particular timeI am not convinced that they represent the maximum of either efficiency or of economy in the good administration of Government. Even in the lower grades of classified Federal employees. a good deal has been invested by the Government in their training. But those who have lost their jobs can hardly be expected to wait patiently until they are recalled into service. This means that a constant training program for new recruits must be maintaineda costly operation for either Government or industry. Furthermore. with Government employment no longer offering its former security and stability. the generally lower salaries paid by Government. in comparison with the salaries paid by private industry. are scarcely likely to attract the most desirable workers into the service of their country.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on February 13 I introduced Senate bill 3280. providing that an additional $250 million be made available for the acreagereserve program of the Soil Bank. I introduced the bill because I had just returned from Kentucky. and there I had learned at firsthand that our farmers had signed up for the contracts to place corn in the Soil Bank in an amount far exceeding the sum which had been appropriated and allotted in 1957 for corn in the 195b Soil Bank. I am very glad the Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended the additional appropriation of $250 million in the supplemental appropriation bill we are now considering. That amount. when approved by the Senate. will add to the $500 million provided in 1957. and will provide a total of $750 million for the acreagereserve program during this fiscal year. And it will correct the inequity which developed because of the unexpected participation by farmers in the acreagereserve program for 1958. I think it is only fair to say that the situation which developed cannot be laid at the door of the Department of Agriculture. The fact is that last year. when the appropriation bill providing funds for the Soil Bank program came to the Senate of the United States. it had no money for the acreage reserve of the Soil Bank program. It was with great difficulty that we were able to include in the appropriation a provision for $500 million for the acreage reserve. That was done in the Senate of the United States and later approved by the House.",

Last year the corn farmer was waiting for legislative action relative to what would be the approved number of acres for the commercial corn area as a basic allotment. 37.300.000 acres were approved for the commercial area. The historical planting would amount to about 57 million acres. Everyone knew that acreage allotment was too small to enable the farmer to participate. However. the increased corn acreage allotment bill which was introduced by me was defeated on April 10. Therefore. many farmers who had waited to see what would happen to that proposed legislation were caught short. Furthermore. not too many were thoroughly familiar with the reserve acreage phase of the Soil Bank. They learned much in calendar year 1957. Therefore. as the opportunity to sign up for participation in the reserve acreage section came about in 1958. there was a great influx of participants. That happened in Minnesota. In the first few days. all the allotments were obligated. because the signups were on a firstcomefirstserved basis. As the Senator from Kentucky visited his State. I. too. visited my State. not only in January. but in February. I found farmers were greatly disturbed. In fact. they came to me wherever they could reach me and talked to me about the matter. I returned to Washington and introduced a bill proposing to increase the appropriation to the full amount authorized by the act. $750 million. Congress had appropriated $500 million. but the authorization permitted $250 million more to be appropriated. I am happy that the bill now before the Senate provides for that fund. Even if approved. there will be more applications than can be taken care of under the additional appropriation. and we shall have reached the maximum amount authorized. There will have to be some surrender if all applications are to be covered. I thank the distinguished Senator for discussing and bringing the question to the floor of the Senate.",

But even these surveys probably understate the decline. Mr. Nossiter predicts that the forthcoming survey by the Department of Commerce and the Securities and Exchange Commission \"will show a larger cutback than earlier forecasts.\" If this turns out to be true. the need for an increase in consumer buying to offset the decrease in business investment becomes urgent. It so happened that exactly 1 year ago today the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly. of which I have the honor to serve as chairman. became concerned with one important phase of this problem.

The question that disturbs me is that we should write into the bill a specific nation and remain silent with respect to the countries in South America. for example. and remain silent with respect to some of the other important nations of the world. It is that question which disturbs me. I believe it was a mistake to write India into the bill by name. The colloquy on the floor will be misunderstood and misinterpreted. That will be unfortunate. so far as it may lend itself to being a propaganda instrument for the Russians or the Soviet bloc. Therefore. I say again that I think the writing of the name of a single nation into this section was a mistake. I shall vote to strike it. so that such mistakes will not be compounded in the future. But I shall vote for every dime which is contained in the authorization for mutual assistance. technical assistance. and such programs as will advance India and Indias opportunities in future years.",

Why establish a precedent. as was suggested last night in connection with the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts . Furthermore. I have not heard any Senator mention one of the countries that has proven vitally effective as our friend and has stood with us while the going was rough. While India has taken a position of neutralism. Pakistan has stood with us. Although the circumstances which apply to India are similar to those which apply to Pakistan. this provision refers only to India. The Senator from New Jersey referred to India as being close to Pakistan and on the \"underbelly\" of Russia. But I point out that so is Pakistan. The friction between India and Pakistan has been terrific. and those countries are engaged in an international dispute which has been going on for years. That dispute involves Kashmir. and may result at any CIV---655 moment in a declaration of war between those two countries. What do Senators think our true friends in Pakistanwho have stood with us in the United Nations. while India has taken the other sidewould think if the United States were to say that India. Pakistans neighbor. India. which has murdered great numbers of the people of Pakistan. so many that the valleys ran red with blood. was now to be singled out by the United States for favorable treatment of this sort. Are Senators no longer able to reason? What would be the position of Pakistan if this provision were to remain in the bill? I am glad the debate has been on a high level.

They are wonderful people. They are progressing as fast as they can. It is not necessary to divide our wealth with them. The need is to see that other people let them alone. Let us get back to the Monroe doctrine and spread it out into the Pacific and the Atlantic. if necessary. In the words of General LeMay and General Twining. if any nation comes into that sphere to establish its form of government. politically. economically. or militarily. it will disturb our peace and security. We should simply say that if any nation does so. we will destroy its warmaking capacity at home. Then there will not be a war for 50 years. But we cannot run the world. Two nations have tried it. and there are only a few paragraphs in history with regard to them. We are entering the greatest trade war for all time. For 2.000 years there have been trade wars.

The amendment would provide for a universal 4cent postage stamp instead of the hybrid 5 cent4 cent postage stamp which is proposed in the committee amendment. which is now pending before the Senate. Mr. President. I intend to address myself at some length tomorrow to the advantages of the universal 4cent first class rate. and why such a rate will not bring about as great a loss of revenue as many people suppose. Fortyfour percent of all firstclass mail moves in the intracity transportation and delivery. and the committee amendment provides that the rate for such mail shall be 4 cents. Therefore. that 44 percent of the firstclass mail would produce the same revenue. The only portion of the mail which would affect the revenue would be the 56 percent of the firstclass mail which is the outoftown mail delivered beyond the metropolitan area limits of many of our major cities. where the 5cent postage stamp would obtain. I think the loss or revenue as between the 4cent and 5cent rates would not be too great. There would be a protection. in addition. for the mail users. since they would know whether they should put the 4cent stamp or the 5cent stamp on a letter mailed. for instance. in Washington. which was going to Bethesda or Chevy Chase or Alexandria. We would. under the procedure I propose. avoid much untoward confusion by having a simple universal 4cent postage stamp. For that reason. Mr. President.

I hope that my colleagues will take time to familiarize themselves with the provisions and purposes of this legislation. which is so badly needed in many sections of the country. particularly those areas where unprecedented rains and floods last year wrought damage which can be calculated in the billions of dollars.

Her cultural. political. and economic orientation was exclusively toward the West. The notorious Munich dictate of 1938 brought to a temporary end the progress of that country toward freedom and democracy. Czechoslovakia was dismembered and despite valiant uprisings. has remained to this day under Nazi and later Communist control. But the Czechs and the Slovaks have not given up their fight against communism.

Each time the Congress turns its attention to this problem. it becomes increasingly evident how woefully inadequate we are to equitably solve this problem. It has become a political football where Congress is even urged. just to embarrass the administration. to pass a bill which on its face is headed for a Presidential veto. The Federal employees have suffered enough in the past from such procedure and it would seem that the employees would rise up and prevent a recurrence of this procedure. It is my firm conviction that our Federal employees will never receive an equitable wage until the determination of that wage is taken out of the Congress and placed in the hands of some type of a wage board with power to adjust pay by locality on a comparison of like employment. It certainly can be worked out in some manner. just as we had to do it for the blue collar workers on an hourly basis. A national salary rate for the postal and classified civilservice employees is just as unfair and inequitable as it would be for the bluecollar workers. Here is a sample of the variance given to the bluecollar workers to adjust for local conditions in the last wage survey: San Francisco Laborer ----------------------------- $2.09 Helper ------------------------------2.24 Benchmark trades -------------------- 2.67 Washington.

My proposal would immediately provide an additional $250 million for the acreage reserve or soil bank program. This is imperative. since present funds are insufficient and thousands of farmers everywhere may not receive payments they were told would be available. Mr. Speaker. a sum of $750 million was made available for the soil bank in fiscal 1957. Due to various factors. this amount was not fully used. This led to the belief that $500 million for fiscal 1958 would be sufficient. and such was the amount appropriated. We now find this amount is far short of the actual need for carrying out the soil bank program. In my own Congressional District and in many other areas of Indiana and elsewhere. the evident shortage of the soil bank program has left a void and a state of confusion highly aggravating to farm folks. If we are to have effective production controls this year. these additional funds as proposed in my legislation must be made available at once.

At the time this bill was acted on by our subcommittee. we talked to the Department of Agriculture and they advised us it would take an increase of $175 million to include all farmers who tried to participate. In the meantime the Department had scaled down the time limit within which farmers could sign up. They moved it back from The Department notified each farmer of the change in date. so it is my belief that every farmer has full knowledge that he must have taken action by February 20. The Department stated this morning that they have signups or attempted signups that will equal the full amount authorized under the law. which is $750 million. Our committee met just a few minutes ago and voted to offer a committee amendment to raise the amount you see in the bill by another $75 million. which is the maximum allowed under the law.

I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the House and commend them for the favorable action which has just been taken on this bill. This legislation will make it possible for a very substantial number of ministers. who failed to receive information as to their rights or who received misinformation. to elect socialsecurity coverage. The problem involved was at least a twofold one. First. many ministers throughout the country had failed to exercise their right under the law to elect to receive social security coverage within the time specified by the law. It was evident that a large number of these ministers did desire coverage and that their failure to act was caused by lack cf knowledge or by misunderstanding of the provisions of existing law. Second. I was informed that a very large number of ministers who were employed by certain churchrelated nonprofit organizationssuch as colleges chartered by churcheswere erroneously enrolled along with lay employees and that when this became known they were in a position of possibly losing their social security coverage. This legislation will make it possible for such persons to elect coverage as though they were selfemployed. just as the other ministers have been covered. I initiated this legislation not only because a number of these ministers had discussed these problems with me but also because the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America had taken action requesting the Congress to amend the basic provisions of the act so that these ministers could obtain coverage. The amendment which the Senate has added to the basic legislation is entirely agreeable to me. It. in brief. would provide that a minister who elects or has elected coverage under oldage and survivors insurance shall. in determining his net earnings from selfemployment. include the rental value of his parsonage and the value of meals and lodging furnished to him for the convenience of the employer. Under existing law. this cannot be counted for social security purposes. I am advised that in many instances the value of the parsonage. meals and lodging recetved by ministers constitutes a significant portion of their total earnings and therefore this amendment should be of material assistance to ministers.",

The Senate added three main amendments to this bill. The first amendment is designed to make sure that the division in the case of interstate instrumentalities. to the extent practicable. will be on the same basis as the division now permitted to specified States. The Senate also substituted a more general retroactive coverage provision which would be applicable to agreements and modifications pertaining to services performed for a State or any of its political subdivisions. as well as those pertaining to services performed for an interstate instrumentality. Under the Senate amendment a coverage agreement or modification could be made effective any time after December 31. 1955. if the agreement or modification is entered into prior to 1960. The Senate also added a provision which would remove the bar to coverage of policemen and firemen covered by a State or local retirement system in the States of Alabama. Georgia. Maryland. New York. and Tennessee. and in Hawaii. I urge that the House recede and concur in these Senate amendments.",

    "speech": "That is correct. Mr. Speaker. the pertinent provisions involved in this difference between the House and Senate in this bill are that the bill. as passed by the House. authorized $200 million for the operation of the directloan program of the Veterans Administration to July 25. 1958. The Senate. in approving the bill. reduced this authorization to $50 million and extended the program until July 25. 1959. along with a 1year extension to the same date for the guaranteedloan program for World War II veterans. The House accepted the extension to 1 year. but insisted on the full amount of the money previously authorized which. in effect. meant $200 million to July 25. 1958. and $150 million additional to July 25. 1959. The Senate has now adopted an amendment which provides for $200 million for the program until July 25. 1958. The action which I have proposed is the only practical approach at the present time and one which I take with considerable regret. I say this with all due respect to the other body. but it is illogical to me to increase the authorization of a direct loan from $10.000 to $13.500. and at the same time reduce the amount of money that is available for this program. I am. therefore. urging the House to concur in the Senate amendment. and at the same time I am introducing legislation to provide that beginning July 26. 1958. and continuing through July 25. 1959. the Veterans Administration shall have $150 million authorization which it has had to operate this program in recent years when the overall limit for one loan was only $10.000.",

This bill merely extends the period of training from 2 to 3 years for physicians who are studying physical medicine and rehabilitation under the program of the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation. . According to the best available estimates. there are 500 vacant positions requiring a qualified specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation at the present moment. The key to adequate medical service and rehabilitation centers and hospitals is adequately trained personnel. As a new specialty. physical medicine and rehabilitation must compete for physicians with older medical specialties. such as internal medicine. orthopedics. and neurology. In order to obtain doctors in this field. it is necessary to support their training during the full 3year period required by the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. The specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation is the key member of the personnel team providing rehabilitation service to disabled persons. The extension of this legislation in providing more of these specialists will result in greater numbers of physically handicapped persons returning to an active life and in many instances taking them from relief rolls. Miss Mary Switzer. Director of the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation. has been of great assistance to the Committee on Education and Labor in its consideration of proposed legislation in this field. She was especially helpful in explaining the problems faced in the rehabilitation process and the need to have more specialists in physical medicine and rehabilitation. Enactment of this bill will assist in completing the training of these crucially needed trained specialists and will make an invaluable contribution to the field of rehabilitation of the physically handicapped. The bill was ordered to be read a third time. was read the third time. and passed. and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. A similar House bill was laid on the table.",

The growth of these funds has been phenomenal. As examples. 8.800.000 persons had group life insurance in 1940. and 35.300.000 at the end of 1956. In 1940. 6.300.000 were covered by group hospitalization plans and 83.600.000 16 years later. Beneficiaries of pension plans totaled 14.300.000 at the end of 1956. as compared with 3.700.000 in 1940. Clearly there is a public interest in these funds. Action has been too long deferred. As a member of the committee. I voted to report this bill because it will authorize public disclosure of all plansa principle recommended by the administration. This is legislation which is needed to assure honest administration of plans which presently total some $35 billion and which eventually may come to aggregate about $80 billion. Legislation of this kind represents a corrective first step in an area where substantial abuses of trust have been shown. Yet. Mr. Chairman. I personally have grave reservations about the effectiveness of the legislation. as it is presently written. As I pointed out in the supplemental views which I filed as part of the committee report on this bill. I hope certain changes can be made in the provisions of the bill. Some of these changes may be made by way of amendment. others may be made in conference if that situation should develop. My basic concern is that we may have legislation in an important area which will not be a wholly effective instrument for accomplishing its purpose. The measure. despite its deficiencies. enlists my support because I believe sincerely it will provide some help in protecting the equities of millions of workers in these funds. and will renew the confidence of those who rely for their future economic security on these benefits.",

Hearings were held by Chairman McCONNELL of the House Committee on Education and Labor in the 83d Congress. Similar hearings were held in the other body in the 83d Congress. In the 84th Congress extensive hearings were held and many hundreds of pages of testimony taken and field studies made and questionnaires examined and hundreds of pension and welfare plans investigated. But even this exhaustive study only resulted in the detailed examination of one unilaterally administered levelofbenefits plan. namely that of General Motors Corp. According to the report of the committee of the other body over 1.200 various plans were looked into. a number of unilaterally administered levelofbenefit plans studied but only one looked into in detail. The committee report admitted that this type of plan had not been investigated and recommended that further investigation be made. But the whole point is that it is idle to say that there is no evidence of mismanagement when there is no evidence whatsoever. At this same stage all the welfare plans could be said to be pure as the snow because no investigation had been made. But after detailed investigation was made. then evidence of mismanagement. of corruption. of ineptness. began to pour in resulting in the demand for disclosure legislation culminating in todays proposal. For example there was a plan investigated in my own State and a brief reference is made to it in the Senate report. This is the plan of the Anaconda Co.. a health. sickness. death plan insured in Mutual of Omaha. I dont know whethe.r it was a levelofbenefits plan. but under the contract it could have been. The report doesnt indicate that. But the report does show that an officer of the union was getting a commission of onehalf of 1 percent on the premium paid. It was suggested that there was a conflict of interest here. But whether there was or not. whether anything dishonest had or had not been done. I think it appropriate that disclosure of the commission paid to that union officer be made to the employee beneficiaries. Mr. BOSCHs amendment would prevent such disclosure and keep the beneficiaries from learning about a commission being paid to an officer of their union by the insurance company.",

I would. however. like to call to the attention of the membership one paragraph of the report. The distinguished chairman. the gentleman from North Carolina . referred to it. He said the principal objection to the bill was that there was no enforcement. He is so right. On page 11 of the report. and I think it is worth reading to you. there is one sentence which to me strikes at this principal objection. I read: It is the Intention of the committee that no fine or penalty provided for under this act. whether civil or criminal. shall be imposed except for deliberate defiance or persistent refusal in bad faith to comply with a clear obligation imposed by the provisions of this act. In other words. it is different from the Senate bill. S. 2888. The latter had some teeth in it. It had certain provisions for punitive action. This bill. as he candidly points out. does not. I would like to call the attention of the distinguished gentleman to one paragraph of the good report by the gentlewoman from Oregon which I wish she had stressed in her statement because of its importance. It is found on the last page of the reporton page 29. She points out that the bill failed to provide any method of investigating suspected wrongdoing or deterring those who may be engaged in plundering a fund. There is no deterrent for that in the billnone whatsoever. In paragraph 10 of the same report. the gentlewoman from Oregon points out that the bill provides no criminal penalty for embezzlement. kickbacks. selfdealing or other wrongdoingthe very things that the gentleman from Michigan was asking about. So much for that. If the Bosch amendment fails. I may have an amendment to propose. It would take care of those situations. It would not exempt those situations where labor and management have sat down and bargained out a provision which would be a part of a pension fund. That is far different from the socalled levelofbenefit plans and I am not really sure whether that term has not been used here a little too loosely today.",

Another field of research with which I am most concerned is soil and water research experimentation. In the Pacific Northwest. we are in great need of a soil and water research laboratory to study the unique problems of our area.

He said he had recently visited some of his camps in the vicinity of Everett and found hardwood plywood mahogany doors suitable for use in high priced homes being used in bunkhouses in his own logging camps. The gentleman may not think that $60 million of Japanese plywood is any substantial quantity. but that is 10 percent of the entire exports of Japan to the United States. It also represents the jobs. and this is based on information from competent authorities. of 5.000 men who work in the plywood industry plus 3.000 more who are employed in the woods to supply the raw materials on which these plants operate.",

The proof of the pudding is in the eating and the proof that excessive imports of plywood exist is evident to anyone who knows the Northwest. The measure of its effect is the unemployment which exists in every lumber camp on the northwestern coast. Certainly. it is obvious to anyone who listened to the testimony presented before the Committee on Ways and Means recently. All interested in domestic production of plywood testified in effect and conclusively as employers. as investors. but particularly as workers. regarding the bad effect of these imports on employment. They came before the committee in person or by their written statements and they all agreed that the excessive imrorts of plywood are the basic cause for the unemployment which exists in the lumber industry in the Great Northwest. They were seeking the support of their Representatives in the Congress to pass legislation to provide a law which would be effective in giving relief in this vast area of unemployment. They were appealing to their Representatives. And I commend the gentleman from Washington for his testimony here today. May I ask the gentleman this question. We are talking now of an industry in Japan which employs exceedingly cheap labor. measured by the dollars and cents that we pay our employees in these lumber camps in the United States. What does the gentleman know of the Japanese industrys plant equipment. knowhow. and skill in manufacturing plywood? I ask the gentleman. are we talking about an industry in which they use poor equipment. or are they using modern equipment?",

It is a matter proposed by the Japanese as a matter of selfdefense. the means by which they say. \"We will do no more of this. provided you do not have Congress exercise its authority and impose quotas upon these excessive imports.\" I suggest if we rely upon foreign countries to make voluntary agreements among themselves to curtail importations into this country on those items which cause unemployment. then we are relying upon a group of people in a foreign country to protect our industry. which is contrary to the intent of the Constitution and contrary to the intent of our form of government.

The Ways and Means Committee of which I am a member has just finished 5 weeks of hearings. morning and afternoon. on this general subject. People who attended those hearings could have no doubt but that excessive imports of plywood from Japan have inflicted such serious injury upon the American industry that the top tariff should be imposed and that quotas should be imposed. I am completely convinced from the hearings before our committee that a voluntary system of restricted imports whether it be of plywood. residual fuel oil. petroleum itself. lead. zinc. or whatnot. will not work. because it has been proven. I may say to the gentleman from Washington. in the last few days that it did not work in the petroleum industry. The executive department so recognized by their action on this point a few days ago. although the Commission in my opinion committed a grievous error in not including residual fuel oil in the order they made which said that distilled products were not included. and that in effect residual fuel oil did not come in. I again compliment the gentleman from Washington and I suggest to the gentleman from Oregon that he read the hearings before the Committee on Ways and Means.

His letter follows: To the EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES: Every year when spring approaches the Nation engages in a debate on foreign aid. The administration tries. as it were. to sell a certain amount of foreign aid to Congress. and Congress refuses to buy that amount. If Congress appropriates much less than the $3.9 billion requested. the President has just told us. we will have \"a beleaguered America. her freedoms limited by mounting defense costs and almost alone In a world dominated by international communism.\" Congress. unimpressed by such hyperbolic statements. has In the past not been deterred from slashing appropriations for foreign aid. There is little doubt that Congress will not be impressed this time. either. Responsibility for this sad and dangerous state of affairs lies primarily with the administration. which has not been able to convince the American people that it must have $3.9 billion because it has not presented to the people a rational and intelligible program for foreign aid. because no such program exists. In the absence of a wellthoughtout and coherent aid policy. oriented toward and subordinated to the political objectives of our foreign policy. the administration asks the people to buy a package whose contents they must take on faith.",

March 9. 1958. entitled \"Nonsense About Foreign Aid\": Should the American taxpayer give up his hardearned pennies in order to buy striped pants for Greek undertakers? Should he provide bathtubs for Egyptian camel drivers? Is it right that the sweat of his brow should be expended in order to plant grass along the highways to Lebanon. or to build roads so the King of Saudi Arabia may exercise his expensive imported American motor cars. or to furnish iceboxes for Eskimos? It is not right. as Director James H. Smith. Jr.. of the International Cooperation Administration\" testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It is not right and it hasnt happened. The ICA did bty shoes for the Greek Army. It did provide facilities for Egyptians. including .camel drivers. to fight hookworm by washing their feet. It did help Lebanon plant grass to stop erosion. It built no roads in Saudi Arabia. although it did improve a port and an airfield. It didnt give any iceboxes to Eskimos. they didnt want any. Mr. Smith shouldnt have had to use up his own time and the time of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in answering this sort of nonsensical rumor. Even those who invented these stories probably didnt believe them. They were intended to fool people. But if the opposition to the $3.9 billion foreignaid program is so devoid of good arguments that it has to resort to this sort of thing. perhaps we may be hopeful. It is true that not every penny is expended without error. The pennies we spend on domestic government are not expended without error. But there is no doubt that we get as much out of our foreignaid program in benefits to our neighbors and in security to ourselves as we do out of any funds appropriated by any governmental agency for any other purpose.

It is a bit difficult to know how the administration .really views the recession. On February 12. the President said \"every indication is that March will commence to see the start of a pickup in job opportunities. That should mark the beginning of the end of the downturn in our economy.\" A week later. however. Gabriel Hauge. his economic assistant. said there was a \"mistaken impression\" that the President had \"predicted a business upturn in March.\" The administration has failed to realize that economic slumps can snowball. growing progressively worse while the Government stands hesitant or takes only faltering steps to halt the recessions growth. There are many economists who believe that a reduction in income taxes would have the effect of helping halt the recession by increasing consumer spending. Reductions effective in 1949 stimulated consumer spending and were a bulwark against the recession of that year. In 1954another year of recessiontax concessions were translated almost dollar for dollar into an increase in consumer buying and business sales. which were a major supporting factor in the economy. The senior Senator from Illinois. PAUL DOUGLAS. has introduced alternative bills reducing Federal taxes. One of these would increase the personnal exemption from $600 to $700. the other would cut the tax on the first $1.000 of net income from 20 to 15 percent. A number of excise taxes would a~so be decreased by these bills. The total tax remission would be about $4.4 billion.

Jr.. concerning the much discussed and unsettled matter of national interest which calls for considered legislative action. That issue is who. constitutionally. can act in case of the inability of the President to discharge the duties of his office. Mr. Smith points out the two crises that almost developed in our history during the long illness of former Presidents Garfield and Wilson. In both instances Congress debated the issue but failed to act. The writer declares tiat in a nuclear and atomic age the hazards to the President are far greater than ever before and indicates that the absence of Presidential leadership. action. and power. in case of disability. may lead to far greater consequences. He discusses several proposals before Congress citing that our Constitution fails to spell out who can act for a disabled Chief Executiveand concludes that no thoughtful citizen can disagree with President Eisenhowers warnings that the doubts surrounding this question should be resolved. Because this article summarizes so brilliantly the whole disturbing situation. I commend the article highly to my colleagues and ask that it be preserved In the RECORD.

All Americans can be proud of our countrys support of the efforts of the Greeks to free themselves from alien rule during their great War of Independence which began 136 years ago today.

Greece is indeed the mother of western civilization and from her have come the basic values which animate America todayvalues which have drawn many Greeks to our shores seeking freedom and opportunity.

It is all the more tragic therefore that today our Nations gates are barricaded so that we no longer welcome Greeks to our shores with open heart and hand. These barricades must be lifted.

But if the slaughtering houses do not voluntary comply. then Congress can and should act. and pass a bill which would have teeth in it. I repeat that what the House has passed amounts to nothing.

I believe. the Anchor Serum Co.. which is one of the largest serum companies in the United States. and a company with which my family has done business for 25 years. relating to the problem of hog cholera serum as it may be affected by certain types of socalled slaughtering practices. The statement of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. in pointing out what he considers to be a weakness of the bill as passed by the other body. and the weakness of the amendment I have pending at the desk. is to the effect that the proposal applies only to a few slaughtering houses. and that there are more than 3.000 to which it would not apply. Enough cholera serum could be obtained from the 3.000 slaughtering houses to which the bill does not apply. The Senator from Louisiana cannot have it both ways. If the bill does not go far enough in terms of coverage. then it cannot go so far as to thwart the production of hog cholera serum. I might add that today there are other large slaughtering houses which utilize humane slaughtering practices. Those houses seem to have been doing quite well. both in terms of research in the field of biologicals and serums and in the field of meat products.",

There is a very substantial division in the Department of Agriculture engaged in research in the field of serums. viruses. biologicals. antibiotics. and so forth. There has been nothing to interfere with the Department of Agriculture making such a study long ago. As I shall show in the debate. humane slaughtering practices are today already utilized by some of the largest slaughtering houses. It is amazing to me that at the very late hour of the last week of the testimony on the bill. the serum companies and the Department of Agriculture should suddenly discover that there may be some problem about serum. although they did not discover it 2 years ago when the hearings were held. Dr. Clarkson. of the Department of Agriculture. was asked again and again whether humane slaughtering practices might be injurious to the research efforts of the Department. I have the record of the testimony. Furthermore. I want the record to note that I wrote to the Anchor Serum Co. I am familiar with the operations of that company. The business with which my family is associated has sold millions of cubic centimeters of hog cholera serum over a period of 40 years. I wrote to the company to the effect that I considered their efforts not to be very meritorious. because if they were really concerned they should have been concerned before the last 3 days of the hearings. since the bill has been before the Congress for 3 years.",

That was just another way to attack the Jewish religion. But those provisions did not contain such a protection as there is in this bill. There was no proviso in the legislation with respect to kosher slaughtering. Studies were made in. the British Parliamentand they are a matter of record. as I shall show laterand testimony of leading experts as to what were humane methods of slaughter was presented to the British House of Commons. Such methods were prescribed by the British House of Commons. So it is not as though we were venturing into territory which has never been explored.

The United States has always been a great maritime Nation. In recent years we have lost this lead to the English. the French. the Italians. and others. It is important for us to maintain our position as a great seapower. both from the standpoint of civilian travel and of miltary needs. Although Americans account for from 80 to 90 percent of all passengers in transAtlantic travel. Americanflag participation in this business has dropped to less than 20 percent. Recent studies indicate that transAtlantic travel will continue to grow. In fact. even in this year of recession the Passport Office of the State Department reports more requests for overseas travel than in any previous year. There are only two major ships. the America and the United States. operating over the North Atlantic route. which is the most heavily traveled sea route in the world. and these two carry about onefifth of the passengers. America should be prepared to hold its part of this ever increasing and important business. This is not only a matter of good business for the country. but is necessary in order for us to have an adequate merchant marine to take care of our defense needs overseas. The Defense Department appeared and testified in support of this legislation. because these new ships will significantly reduce our qualitative deficiency in troop transport potential. Therefore. for these two reasons. the first. the need for America to maintain a strong merchant marine position. and secondly. the support which the building of these two great ships will give our defense posture.

The amendment which I have offered to section 2 I am quite certain will save the taxpayers some money. I speak from 35 years experience in shipbuilding. The bids which the Maritime Board in Its discretion may accept in awarding this contract were issued on December 10. 1956. They were opened on March 21. 1957. At that time we anticipated more inflation. the shipyards were busy. large tankers were being built. and other bids were being talked about. As was to be expected. prices went up. Today. 1958. however. presents a different situation. There is no question but that we are in a period of some recession. The language of the bill reads in effect that in order that the building of these ships may be accomplished promptly. the Federal Maritime Board. in its discretion. may have such a vessel constructed without further bidding. Time of delivery is an important factor. Certainly now with competent builders needing more business. new bids on the same basis should be requested. It would be found that competent builders thoroughly familiar with all of the figures. in the light of the present economic situation would bid lower. A 5 percent lower bid would represent a saving of over $5 million. My amendment would strike this discretionary language from this unusual act which allows the acceptance of a bid over a year old. Bear in mind also the fact that no ship can be started for some months in any event. So in good conscience I desire the House to reconsider this matter. To give you the benefit of what I know about this business I offer this amendment to strike the language and thus require new bids on the present market.",

This year. unlike prior years. the Senate originated the bill. The basic bill is a Senate bill. Therefore a great deal of the language in the bill is Senate language. In past years we have passed one bill and the House has passed another bill. Then we have had to allow some latitude between the two bills. and in many cases the two bills were vastly different from one another. The House has yielded in some instances and the Senate in others. It is not fair to make a comparison between what we did this year and what prevailed in prior years. The House has actually yielded on a number of items on which I am sure the House would have preferred not to have yielded. Quite frankly..we have yielded on matters on which we did not desire to yield. It is true that philosophically the House Members have agreed on a great many points with the Senate conferees. Nevertheless. the House conferees. mindful of their obligations as conferees on the part of the House. have felt an obligation. not to the Committee on Appropriations of the House. but to the House itself. to represent the point of view of that body.

The Senator from New Jersey a moment ago confirmed what I said about the influence of the House Committee on Appropriations. We are concerned here with an authorization bill. and it is eminently proper that we insist upon our views concerning the policy in accordance with which the program shall be operated. leaving to the Committee on Appropriations. under the usual traditions of Congress. the question of what is a reasonable amount to carry it into effect. But it was quite clear in the committee of conference that the House conferees were subject to dictation by the House Committee on Appropriations. There is one other point I wish to make to confirm that statement. I recall a conference not very long ago with the House conferees on the State Department appropriation bill. We were confronted with very much the same situation. and it was an extremely arbitrary and difficult situation. It irritates me. especially when I pick up a newspaper. as I did yesterday. to read that Congress is to blame for the situation concerning ambassadors. because Congress refuses to appropriate sufficient representation money for the Embassies in London and Paris. I recall very well who cut those appropriations downand it was over the Senates protest. It seems to me that in every conference in which I have participated. which has involved foreign affairs. the Senate has been dragooned by the House into adopting policies which I think are disastrous to the longterm welfare of the United States in the field of foreign affairs. I recall very well what happened at the conference this spring. The House had. its way very largely. They cut down the representation allowances. thus making it necessary from now on. I suppose. to appoint persons to ambassadorships because of their party contributions and because of their wealth. but not because of their qualifications. Congress is blamed by the press for this situation. I say it should be the House Committee on Appropriations.

I did not vote for it because history after World War I showed that. under Woodrow Wilson and William McAdoo. we poured billions and billions of dollars into Europe. The only country that ever repaid us was Finland. So the Marshall plan was nothing new. It was simply a reinauguration and a continuation of the program started by Woodrow Wilson. The very fact that Coolidge. Harding. and Hoover. 3 Republican Presidents. gave away not $1. and took the nearly $3 billion which was receivedit may not have been quite that muchand applied it on the national debt showed that we had 3 Republican Presidents interested in keeping the national debt down. It was not until Franklin Roosevelt that we inaugurated the system of more loans. grants. and gifts. To me the Marshall plan was nothing new. It was as old as the hills.

High productivity per man in farming is a priceless asset that permits America to devote relatively little manpower to supplying basic food and fiber needs. I have read that paragraph because we constantly hear remarks to the effect that there are too many inefficiently run farms in the United States. that the operation of the inefficient farms should be stopped and that larger farms should be established intheir places. Mr. President. If this Nation should ever be so unfortunate as to lose the family farms and become solely dependent on corporate types of farming.

Ed is now president of the department of public utilities of the State of New Jersey. In his recent letter to me on the celebration of Americanization Day in Pershing Field on April 28. 1957. Mr. Hart writes: I have never missed the celebration throughout the many years it has been conducted. and when in the House. made it a practice to insert in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an account of the celebration at the field and a mention of the great parade which is held In connection with it. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. under leave to extend my remarks. included herein is an account of the Americanization Day celebration at Pershing Field this year.

The House bill. when it went to the other body. contained the Fisher amendment. which was stricken out by that body. The difference between these two bills in this one instance with respect to public housing is so fundamental that the House should refuse to concur. If the Fisher amendment can be maintained over future years. it alone will save the taxpayers billions of dollars. Then. again. 4 or 5 of the publichousing amendments approved by the other body are so far reaching. in adding additional expense that they should be stricken. as they go beyond the welfare purpose which was the original intent of the law. Here are their provisions: First. Would permit overincome tenants to remain in public housing indefinitely if the public hopsing authority determines that adequate housing is not available in the private market consistent with the tenants income less all his exemptionssection 401 (a) of the Senatepassed version of H. R. 6659. Second. Would repeal the requirement that a community have a workable program for the prevention of slums or blight as a prerequisite to public housingsection 401 (c). Note: The workable program was placed in the law in 1954. repealed in 1955. and reenacted in Third. Would increase the income exemptions for determining whether a family is eligible for admission to public housing. Exemptions are also increased",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the important reasons for the magnitude of the budget is that in the years past. both during peace and war. people generally believed in economy in Government by and for the other fellow. The chief obstacle which we now encounter in cutting the budget. in this economy drive. is that everyone wants the cut to be borne by the other fellow. If this alltime high peacetime budget is to be substantially trimmed that selfish policy of \"letting George do it\" must be abandoned. The cuts must be borne proportionately by all American citizens. Under the title \"High Taxes Result of Unbridled Spending.\" on March 19. 1952. I laid before the House my own views as to the necessity for applying the brakes on the inflationary trek the Government was pursuing. Among other things. I pointed out: The policy of everybody \"touching\" the Federal Government had likewise developed into the policy of the Federal Government \"touching\" everybody. Even the humblest citizen now realizes that the Federal Government is no Santa Claus. In fact. we have reathed the saturation point in taxation. Under a 10point program. I then said among other things: And finally. the citizens of the Republic. now conscious as never before of the burdens of taxation. must practice the doctrine of States responsibility as well as States rights. The. practice of looking to Washington for Federal aid in civil responsibilities of their own must cease. They must realize that there is no State. county. or city whose financial statement is not sounder than that of the Federal Government. Among those who have practiced the selfish but shortsighted policy of attempting to get everything they could out of the public till while at the same time clamoring for economy in Governmentby the other fellowhave been many of our big industrialists and business people. It was. therefore. with much interest that I read a recent editorial from the Iron Age of May 30. 1957. taking businessmen to task for this policy. which was called to my attention by the able and highly respected veteran of the Washington press. Paul Wooten. The editorial by the able editor in chief of that splendid magazine. Mr. Tom Campbell. follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. no Member of this Congress has a more profound belief in the rights of the workingman than I have. He has a right to organize and bargain collectively for those things that improve his economic position in our great economy. He also has a right to a binding contract that insures those things for which he lawfully bargains. He has those rights when dealing with private industry. The law gives them to him. But he does not have those rights when dealing with Government when the Government or some segment thereof is operating a proprietary business venture in competition with its citizens. Many leaders of organized labor. in fact the majority of them insist that the Government should build and operate these hydroelectric projects. In fact. some of the leaders of labor think the Government should produce and distribute all of our electric power. But what leaders of labor or members of an organized union are better able to judge what is best for them than those working in the electric industry? The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers at one time supported Government development of power facilities but they have found through bitter experience that Government ownership is not what it is cracked up to be. Their rights. working conditions. pay. and other benefits when working for Government power operations are inferior to -those obtained from private industries. Those leaders of labor who so ardently support Government ownership of electric properties might well listen to their brothers in the IBEW who. from past years of experience. are much better informed on the subject.

It is necessary to compel Russia to withdraw to her ethnic boundaries. and to liberate Poland and other nations of the southeastern Europe from the Russian slavery. We consider as final the boundaries of Poland in the west on the Odra and Nisa Luzyeka Rivers as a guaranty against German aggression not only upon Poland but the whole of southeastern Europe. The eastern boundaries of Poland must include the Zbrucz River. Wilno. and Lw6w. We acknowledge that only the legal Polish Government with its President. August Zaleski. temporarily in London. has the exclusive rights to speak for the Polish nation. We express our gratitude and appreciation to the Congress of the United States for bringing out from oblivation the Katyn massacre. and we appeal for the introduction of this matter to the forum of the United Nations for the enforcement of justice. We declare that the rights of the Polish nation for the retaliation of the injustice done in the last war do not require justification. The contribution of Poland to the defense of freedom in the Second World War was the most outstanding. Western democracy won the war. but lost peace.

I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to liberalize the program for distributing surplus feed grainsincluding corn. barley. oats. grain sorghum. rye and othersto farmers in disaster stricken areas. The proposed legislation would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make surplus feed grains available to aid folks in economic distress as a result of tornadoes. hurricanes. floods. hail. or other natural disasters. Under the present law. the Secretary is authorized to make feed grains availto farmers only if an area is declared a national disaster area by the President. Unless such a declaration is made. however. there is now no authority for distributing such feed grains. As we know. there are often areas devastated by tornadoes. cyclones. hurricanes. or other natural disasters. which do not meet the criterion of a national disaster. yet the folks in these communities suffer tremendous loss. In Wisconsin. for example. it has not yet been possible to determine the extent of the recent destruction. However. it is extremely high. Nationally. the damage from tornadoes. hurricanes. floods. and other catastrophes is estimated at over $75 million annually. Currently. the Commodity Credit Corporation inventory contains vast volumes of feed grains including the following. in bushels: Cornover 1 billion. barley46 million. oats14.5 million. grain sorghum163 million. rye4.7 million. These stockpiles can. and should. I believe. be used to assist folks in serious economic distress. As my colleagues know. our laws now provide for distribution of surplus foods to disasterstricken folks. This is. indeed. a splendid program.

It was my privilege to meet Walter Johnson shortly after I came to Washington. In fact. I had the fun and privilege of batting in a soft ball game in which Walter Johnson was the pitcher. at a Republican picnic in th3 State of Maryland. I do not know how many other Senators ever had the privilege of batting against Walter Johnsons pitching. but I assure Senators that it gave me a thrill. Through the years Walter Johnson has symbolized a great ambition for many American boys.

I found that a number of Senators whom we had expected to be with us against the jurytrial amendment stated that while they would have liked to vote against it. they were nevertheless afraid that if the jurytrial amendment were defeated the southerners would then filibuster the bill and prevent any bill from being passed. I tried to disabuse my friends of this feeling. and said to them that the issue was sufficiently important to justify a long struggle. and that those of us who believe in civil rights should be as determined in our advocacy as were those who are opposed to civil rights. Nevertheless. this feeling was very powerful. and it contributed. I am sure. to the inclusion of the jurytrial amendment. There is a moral to be drawn from that fact. There was no filibuster exercised in discussing the amendments. but the threat of a filibuster was always present. and it operated very powerfully to weaken and cripple the bill. The inevitable conclusion is that the case for modifying rule XXII to curb filibusters is greatly strengthened. I said last January. when we were striving to modify rule XXII. that we would probably not be able to adopt a meaningful civilrights bill unless rule XXII were changed. We were assured that this was not necessary. It has now turned out to be a fact. The vital features of the civilrights bill have now been extracted by a coalition and by the threat of a filibuster. In my judgment. we must now move on as soon as possible to change rule XXII and to make it more possible for the will of a majority of the Senate to express itself and so that it will no longer be possible for a small but powerfully entrenched minority to dominate the Senate. and hence to flout the will of the people of the United States.",

    "speech": "I am. I yield myself 10 minutes. Mr. President. Senate bill 2504 would extend the Small Business Administration for 1 year. and would increase the authorization for business loans by $75 million. This bill is in the nature of an emergency action by the Committee on Banking and Currency. and is so considered. because of the termination of the agency on July 31. 1957. day before yesterday. The committee held extensive hearings on many bills concerned with the extension and modification of the Small Business Act. and on several other proposals aimed at meeting the credit needs of small business. One of the comprehensive bills considered by the committee was House bill 7963. which passed the House of Representatives on June 25. 1957. The committee had before it a great many bills in addition to the House bill. and there were numerous controversial questions with respect to which members of the committee were not entirely in accord. Because of the pendency of the civil rights bill. and the inability of the committee to take the time to reach an agreement with respect to a number of relatively controversial matters which were before it. it was concluded that the subcommittee would make no definitive report to the full committee. but that we would try to find the least common denominator among all the members of the committee. and report a bill which could be quickly passed before the Small Business Administration expired pursuant to the terms of the act. day before yesterday. The committee bill does two things. It extends the life of the Small Business Administration for 1 year. It provides an additional authorization of $75 million for business loans. which was felt by the committee and by the administration itself to be adequate for the next 12 months. It is the hope of the committee to continue hearings. and to reach an agreement in committee on a much more comprehensive Small Business Administration bill. Speaking personally. as chairman of the subcommitteeand I know my views are shared by a number of my colleagues on this side of the aislewe hope the Small Business Administration can be made permanent. under a charter which would give it a greater ability to perform its functions than it now has.",

    "speech": "The bill would accomplish two things. First. it would extend the life of the Administration for 1 year. from July 31. and second. it would provide an additional business loan authorization of $75 million to keep it going during that period. Of course we were disappointed that we could not pass the bill in the Senate and send it to the House for prompt action. so that it might receive the Presidents signature before the agency expired on the 31st of July. That was a great disappointment. but I should like to point out that under existing law the President has authority to continue the Administration for 6 months after its terminal date. So that no one will have to go without being paid. The agency will not go out of existence because it has not been extended by Congress. in view of the 6 months provision. and certainly no chaos will exist in the Small Business Administration. It is unfortunate that for 48 hours or perhaps even for 72 hours the agency will have been unable to make any business loans. However. if we can get the bill through the Senate promptly and send it to the House. I am sure the situation will be remedied. The Senator from Minnesota has sent to the desk an amendment which would add section 3 to the bill. to alleviate a situation caused by our inability to pass the bill before July 31. The amendment would merely make the action which I hope we will take retroactive to July 31. The amendment is identical in wording with a committee amendment which has been approved by the committee and which I had intended to offer. Inasmuch as the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota is already available to us. I should like to call it up now. if it is agreeable to the Senator from Minnesota.",

All of us must recognize that. while the Small Business Administration may not have done everything we would like to have it do. nevertheless it has done a good job. Since 1953. when the agency was first brought into existence. it has made more than 7.000 loans. totaling approximately $350 million. Not only has the agency made loans to small businesses. and supplied technical and managerial advice to small businesses throughout the country. but. most important of all. it has filled a need in many disaster areas. Many of us forget that fact. The other day the Senator from Louisiana spoke of the great importance of that program of the agency to his State during the recent hurricane there. which caused so much suffering. left so many people dead. and caused many millions of dollars worth of damage. Mr. President. It Is vitally Important that we pass the bill and that we keep the agency in being. particularly when we consider the fact that small business today probably is suffering more than it has ever suffered in the entire history of our country. The brankruptcy rate is higher than it has ever been in our history. and mergers and consolidations are continuing to gobble up smallbusiness firms at a faster rate than ever before. Statistics which have been prepared by the Federal Trade Commission show the number of corporate mergers which have taken place in the last few years. The total has risen from 617 in 1934 to a high of 905 in 1956a 46.6percent increase. The record also shows that there were 411 corporate mergers in the first 5 months of 1957. as compared with 406 for the same period last year. Because of these mergers. the high interest rate. and the present tightmoney policy of this administration. it is very difficult for small business to stay alive. The Small Business Administration stresses cooperation with our banking facilities in making loans to small businesses and in that way does help to keep down the interest rate. This agency is doing a great service in keeping small business alive. Mr. President. the bill should be passed by an overwhelming vote. I yield back the time remaining to me.",

The distinguished Senator. along with his colleagues on the subcommittee. is now investigating the problems of the textile industry. Perhaps he is more conversant with the present difficulties of the industry than are most other Members of the Senate. Georgia is a great cottonproducing and cottonspinning State. The textile industry is the largest employer of any industry within the State. It has been stated on the floor of the Senate on many occasions that the textile industry must pay a wage level 10 times as high as do its competitors in the Far East. In addition. so far as raw materials produced in this country are concerned. the American textile industry must pay about $35 a bale more than the same product sells for overseas. The overseas subsidy is financed by the taxpayers of the United States. So the textile industry is operating under a twoway disadvantage. First. there is the cost of the raw material. which is subsidized in foreign lands by the taxpayers of this country. Second. there is a wage disparity which is on a ratio of about 10 to 1. to the disadvantage of our own domestic producers. I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for bringing this subject to the attention of the Senate. and hope that the Congress and the executive branch will join hands at an early date to do something about the situation.",

I had noticed the item myself. and I feel compelled to join with what my colleagues have said about what seems to me to be a shocking statement about the President of the United States. To charge that President Eisenhower and David Beck are the same kind of men and guilty of similar offenses is so preposterous that it is impossible for those of us who admire and love the President to sit in our seats and not raise a solemn protest. I am sorry to say that this seems to be in line with what has been appearing from the Democratic opposition. In the New York Times of April 30 Mr. Arthur Krock called our attention to the following in his column: Under Its new direction the Democratic Digest hews strictly to the party line as drawn by the national committee and publishes only material which specifically advances this line. Therefore the following from the May Issue is official: \"Emerging from this first 100 days of the second (Eisenhower) term is an image of an irritable. aging. and nervous President who doesnt concentrate on his work. takes many opportunities to get away from his desk. who is nettled by the criticism he is getting. who is uninformed and isolated by a palace guard that feeds him only onepage memos. who is rapidly losing control of his party and has already lost around the world much of the respect which he built up during World War II.\" It is shocking to me that in public life we cannot debate issues honorably and refrain from personalities. as the Senator from New Hampshire has said. I sincerely hope that my good friends on the other side of the aisle realize that these personal attacks on one of the greatest men of our day and age cannot do otherwise than either infuriate the American people. or bring into disrespect our great leader and pour contempt upon the high office of the President of the United States. It is a source of profound regret to me to hear such thoughtless words from one of our colleagues who. although I have disagreed with him in his political views. I have always held in high personal esteem.",

I remember. when I was serving my first year in the Senate. sitting in the chair of the Presiding Officer many a Friday afternoon for 4 or 5 hours and listening to lengthy discourses by the senior Senator from Oregon. I listened with interest to his speeches. because they were based upon study. I was always enraptured by the sense of fairness of the senior Senator from Oregon. He always objected to smears. It seems to me that following his successful campaign last year I heard him make some remarks on the floor of the Senate about smears. So I was surprised to hear that the Senator from Oregon had made such uncomplimentary and uncalled for remarks about the President of the United States. particularly when he based his charge on an act which was passed by a Democratic Congress back about 1946 or 1947. an act which the Democrats have never seen fit to repeal. but to which they now object very violently. Therefore. I am particularly surprised at the remarks which have been attributed to the senior Senator from Oregon. I hope they were erroneously reported. because I have always noted with a great deal of interest his desire to be fair toward everyone. Like the senior Senator from Oregon. I am well acquainted with the vicissitudes of a hard campaign. I believe that anyone who can confine himself to political objectives in a political campaign is to be commended. I read from a reprint entitled \"Morse Speaks His Mind.\" which was printed by Mr. Becks union. The senior Senator from Oregon referred toPerversion of the TaftHartley Act by the Eisenhower National Labor Relations BoardAgain: I know of no group in American labor that has suffered more from the present administration than the teamsters. I do not know whether the teamsters would agree with that statement at the present time. I have great admiration for any man who. in the heat of a strong political campaign. can confine himself to political issues. and refrain from attacking personally his adversery or the President of the United States.

They were promptly headlined in the newspapers in India. in Iran. in Iraq. in Tel Aviv. and in Jerusalem. Nothing detrimental is uttered affecting public service. there is no personal castigation and no demeaning of a public character. which does not find its way to the front page. So it is from that fact that false impressions are created concerning a state of disunity in our own blessed country.

Many of our corn farmers have been under the impression that they could put 50 acres or 50 percent of their corn allotment into the acreage reserve. as they did last year. Now they are told that they cannot sign up for more than 20 acres or 30 percent of their allotment. whichever is larger. This new limitation could work a hardship which I believe could be avoided. Also. we want to make it possible for the soilbank program to achieve its original goals in the reduction of surpluses. The bill. if enacted. would permit a farmer to sign up for the 20 acres or 30 percent of his allotment. whichever is larger. for a cash contract. and then put in additional acres up to 50 acres or 50 percent of his allotment by agreeing to accept payment in kind for the portion above the 30 percent. which in this case would be Governmentowned surplus corn. The bill provides. of course. that in no case shall the farmer receive less in dollar value in corn than he would receive in cash at the time of payment. The proposed legislation would help the Government to get rid of the surpluses which are stored. and accomplish the basic purposes of the soilbank law.",

Numerous complaints have been received by me. and I am sure such is the case with others of my colleagues. to the effect that veterans desirous of buying homes are unable to do so because the mortgage money is scarce at the existing 41/2 percent interest rate. As my colleagues know. FHA raised its interest rate to 5 percent in December of last year. and this. I am told. has had an adverse effect on the money available for veteran housing. As a result. I am informed. the veterans housing program has virtually come to a standstill. Earlier this year I cosponsored proposed legislation with our distinguished majority leader. the Senator from Texas . the purpose of which is to provide direct loans from the Veterans Administration at the 4/2 percent interest rate. in an effort to alleviate the situation which presently exists. Many veterans and home builders in my State tell me that such course of action. while helpful to some degree. does not provide a solution because it would be impossible to make a sufficient amount of money available for the purpose. Frankly. I feel that if we are to have a veterans housing program it should be a workable program. and for this reason I am most anxious that appropriate committees of the Congress have various proposals of relief before them in order that full consideration can be given to all views and an effective solution to the situation arrived at as quickly as possible.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. progress in the development of electric energy from atomic power seems to be lagging badly. A year ago it appeared that private industry was ready and willing to go ahead with the construction of pilot plants. To date. however. this program has not even left the ground. Unless we are to lag far behind other countries in this field. Government must take a hand. It is doubtful whether private corporations could. or should. jeopardize their stockholders investment in expensive experimental projects. Research work in this field is a legitimate function of the Federal Government. and will eventually result in much benefit to private industry. The Senator from Tennessee hag introduced a bill authorizing the Atomic Energy Commission to construct pilot plants. Unfortunately. the Gore bill excludes all New England from any direct benefits which might be derived from such a program. I therefore introduce. for appropriate reference. a joint resolution providing for the construction of an experimental plant in the State of Vermont. I have designated the State of Vermont not solely because it is my own State. but because it is well out of the primary target area in the event of war. because there is an abundant supply of clear. cold water available for use in the operation of a pilot plant. and because Vermont has a public power agency which could accept and distribute electric energy produced at an atomic powerplant in the same manner in which it will distribute power produced from the St. Lawrence power project.

The governors of several States. including the State of Maine. have proclaimed International Theater Month to promote international understanding through drama. In addressing the Land Grant College and University Association on November 16. 1954. President Eisenhower said: There is no aspiration. there is no dream on the horizons of mans hopes and beliefs and faith that is so strong. so vivid as the dream of peacelasting peace. There are many things that must be understood and many things that must be done if we are to make progress toward the realization of that dream. But there is one thing. I think. that educators cannot afford to forget. and that Is the element of understanding as opposed to mere knowledge. International Theater Month. which was inaugurated in 1950 by UNESCO. has contributed immeasurably to the element of understanding of which the President spoke. In past years. scores of dramatic groups throughout the country and in many foreign lands have participated in the presentation of plays. radio. and television productions. and displays during International Theater Month. These presentations have embodied basic human emotions shared by men everywhere. They have included such universal themes as the dignity and worth of the individual. human rights and personal and political freedom. and the need for tolerance in human understanding. In these troubled times. when the United Nations is striving. as never before. to create and foster a spirit of universal respect for justice and human rights. such undertakings as International Theater Month should be recognized for the role they are playing in furthering the goals of world understanding. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the proclamation issued by the Honorable Edmund S. Muskie. Governor of Maine. proclaiming March 1957.

We have recently witnessed the culmination of these events with the -final ouster of the two powers from Egypt. Jordan. and Syria. In the interim.

The deterioration of Western influence since the Communist arms shipment to Egypt and Syria has been acute. and we now face the complex problems raised by the IsraeliArab conflict. the Egyptian seizure of Suez. the armed intervention of England and France. and the continuing Communist infiltration of the area. These problems are made more severe by the shortage of oil in Western Europe and the loss of oil revenues in the Middle East. due to the stoppage of Suez traffic and the destruction of major pipelines. It is my own feeling that the fate of Western civilization may well depend upon the things that happen in the Middle East during the next few years.

I would think there is no reason why the statement should not be made public. The security of the State of Israel is entwined with that of our own country. Israel in a troubled area is an outpost of an industrial order that in our own country in the building up of our large cities has given buying power for the products of our agricultural regions. So will it be in that now troubled area when experience has dissipated the Arab fear of that which is new and from the growth and prosperity of industrial Israel the Arab states will reap benefits beyond calculation. It is to our own interest. as well as being true to the moral law that always must guide our relations with other lands and other peoples. that the Arab states at the very commencement of negotiations under the program provided in House Joint Resolution 117 should understand that the protection of the sovereignty and the interest of the State of Israel is riveted so deeply in the foreign policy of the United States that no American administration in honor and in respect for American public opinion can use it for bartering purposes. I am glad that Secretary of State Dulles in his answer to my question gave reaffirmation of this and that by agreeing to lift the secrecy of an executive session to permit publicity to his words he gave to his words the character of an open pledge to the American people.",

What must the world think of us as a Christian Nation. a Christian people. or foe of communism? According to Congressmen REuss. and this has not been denied. this is a unilateral action. and as such we must bear the sole responsibility for any mistakes. even the mistake of war. to which the Secretary has taken us to the brink. according to his statement. We find the phrase \"consonant with United Nations\" on page 117. And as indicated by the able Mrs. CHURCH and our Mr. REUSS. we might have to withdraw if the United Nations wished us to. If the United Nations has the power to cause us to withdraw then it must or should have the power to police a brush fire war. Finally. we are denied free debate.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. it is typical of President Eisenhower and his great love for democratic principles that he initiated the resolution before us. We are all aware of the purposes of the resolution as set forth in its preamble. but the real purpose is to unite the American people. asking them to speak out in one firm voice through the Congress of the United States. In brief summary. the President wants the world to know in advance that both the President and the Congress of the United States want to help the nations of the Middle East maintain their independence. To help them. he wants authority to aid in developing their economic strength. To protect them while they are developing. he would offer them militaryassistance programs. The Middle East contains the largest oil reserves in the world. Neither we nor the Soviet need that oil. But without it Europe would die as an area of modern western civilization. Without Europe we face international communism alone. The Soviet would like nothing better. The need for keeping communism out of the Middle East and for preserving peace in that area is as simple as that. President Eisenhower in his wisdom knows that he needs the backing of the people and the Congress if his policy is to succeed. The best way to get that is by approval in advance. and not after the fact. It is for the Congress to decide when the Armed Forces are to be used and that again is the Presidents intention. But our President must be able to act and act swiftly in any emergency. Most important. the President wants the world to know where we stand. Advance warning is the best way to stop aggression. Such a policy might well have prevented the Kaiser from starting the First World War. Hitler from starting the Second World War. and the Communists from starting the fight in Korea. Certainly we have proof that the policy was successful in the case of the Formosa resolution. The resolution before us contains the tools by which we can combat such action against any aggressor in the Middle East. I urge the adoption of this resolution by a unanimous vote as the greatest contribution toward world peace. and as the greatest expression of unity and rockbound solidarity of our people.",

That. very frankly. worries me. and I hope that at some future time either the Foreign Affairs Committee or perhaps the other body will find a way in which these points will be made very. very clear. Finally. unfortunately. there is nothing in House Joint Resolution 117 which expresses as the sense of the Congress. nor grants the administration any additional means to strengthen the hand of the United Nations.

The more I think about these two bills the more I am convinced that the gentleman from Michigan has called attention to a most serious and important problem. My contribution to this important and timely matter would be to point out that these two bills deal with a far too limited part of the problem which arises from the unquestionably misleading use of names which. by long usage. surely import connections. or approbation. by official segments of our Government to the firms and businesses involved in such a way as to mislead the most perceptive citizen. Take. for instance. the beverage known as Senators Club. Even though this beverage by the quart or the fifth may never have been purchased by a Member of the other House it is my opinionmy curbstone opinion. that isthat the word \"Senator\" should never have been included in the name of this beverage. The consumer. the buyer of goods and services. which all of us are. must often be under the impression when dealing with firms having certain words in their title. or when buying goods and services using these same words. that he is dealing with. or relying upon. a part of the Federal Government or purchasing items approved by it.

You will be interested in the fact that I have found that the members of the Republican Party take an entirely different approach to this publication when they think it is politically expedient to do so. I have been doing some research on this and in order to set the matter straight I am presenting here some statements showing what the Republicans have said at those times when it suited their purpose to rely on the Congressional Quarterly.

I would like to add one or two thoughts to those presented here. Yesterday the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. General Taylor. presented to a group of us the twowar theory: The ultimate war. the atomic. nuclear war. and the socalled small war or brushfire war. adding further that a nuclear war carried out by the great powers. Russia. United States. and England. could lead to the ultimate destruction of civilization. Small wars or brushfire wars are carried out by men. by human beings. At the present time the great powers. including the United States. are making every effort to reduce their ground forces. That was indicated by the British white paper. relying wholly on the deterrent of a full war. ultimate war. The economists of modernday civilization call for this kind of reduction. Mankind has to rely on manpower to put out the brush wars. and the gentlemans resolution and the resolutions that have been introduced today would provide just that sort of thing. Last month I sent out a pull to some ten thousand people within the Congressional district I represent and asked this question: \"Should the United Nations be authorized to raise its own troops and have its own army to be used to stop aggression?\" That is a far stronger statement than the gentlemans resolution and much stronger. for example. than the gentleman from Arkansas indicated that he would be interested in supporting. And yet. despite the surprising strength of that question. the returns show that 72 percent of the people are in favor of such a strong resolution and such a strong proposal and 28 percent of the people are against it. I cannot think of any better way to say that the American people. if my district is at all representative. are in favor of and would support a resolution of the kind introduced by those of us today.

I should think the best way to whet that appetite would be for him to give his vigorous support to this splendid resolution. It was a significant moment in world history last November when a U. N. General Assembly established the United Nations emergency force to meet the critical need for an international armed patrol in the Middle East. For the first time there came into being an independent military unit capable of giving practical expression to the collective judgment of the world community. Now it seems to me is the time to capitalize on this successful experience in the Middle East by a careful examination of the possibility of creating this permanent international police force. . The concurrent resolution just introduced suggests some of the conditions under which such a force might best operate. Wide public discussion will Serve a very useful purpose. and I hope that the very introduction of this resolution will stimulate fruitful debate.

Too much. of course. should not be expected of it. the police force would not be an army. It could not carry on war such as the United Nations carried on in Korea from 1950 to 1953. Certainly. however. the present police force in the Middle East has. I think it cannot be denied. performed an immensely useful function. It may well be that a similar police force could be used to advantage in some other situations even today. and surely situations will arise in which such a force would be of great value. This year. when the present police force was created. and created very hastily. it was an ad hoc police force. I think it is extraordinary that it was possible to recruit so good a force in so short a time. I believe it has done an extraordinarily useful work. All of us should feel very grateful indeed for the services that have been performed.

The latter force. in particular. is demonstrating the power and usefulness of which the U. N. can be capable if given the necessary authority and equipment. The objective of this resolution is not new or startling. A permanent U. N. police force was architected by the authors of the United Nations Charter. and was considered by them to be fundamental to the cause of lasting world peace. Attempts were made in the earliest years of the United Nations to realize this dream. but efforts by the free nations to implement the design were frustrated by the Soviet sphere. The respect and usefulness of the United Nations emergency force in the Middle East offers the hope that world opinion will so demand its continuation on a permanent basis that Russia will at last be forced to agree.

This constitution. as we know. was one of the first democratic and progressive constitutions in Europe. We are all familiar with dramatic events of the last year involving postwar Poland and I believe these events have contributed greatly to an emerging awareness in the Soviet bloc that the Communist ideology cannot endure forever in the countries which are under their domination. The Soviets may control economically and militarily but activities in recent months prove that the Polish people have not permitted an inroad into their spiritual life and ideals but have held on to their belief in liberty. It is heartening to note that it was the workers who dared to raise their hand against Communist tyranny thereby demonstrating the fallacy in the Communists claim that their philosophy is the rule of the peasants and workers. May 3 gives Americans everywhere an opportunity to pay tribute to the Polish people who are so valiantly struggling to again have complete freedom and to restore the bonds with the West and the United States. These ties have long existed. It was Thaddeus Kosciusko. of Poland. who volunteered his services to our continental Army in the American revolution. He fought so courageously for us because he believed in the principles for which we were fighting. He was made a brigadier general in 1783 and was awarded the Order of Cincinnati which carried the privilege of citizenship and an annual pension. Kosciusko was beloved by other American officers. Shortly before he died. and many years after his return from America. he emancipated his serfs in order to manifest his belief in liberty. equality. and fraternity. Polish Constitution Day.

The story of the new Laundry and Dry Cleaning Trades Union is a tributeto the clean. courageous. responsible leaders and rank and file members of American labor who have worked and are working ceaselessly and dedicatedly to build the foundations for a better labor movement. I am particularly Interested In this new laundry workers union because it was in my own city of Milwaukee that the Laundry and Dry Cleaning Trades International Council was formed earlier this year. and because a Milwaukee union leader. Arno Schulz. whom I know and respect. has played an extremely important part in the new unions creation and subsequent operation. Mr. Schulz is serving as provisional secretarytreasurer of the new International Union. as well as president of local 3008 in Milwaukee. The following article from the AFLCIO News of February 1. 1958. describes the new unions creation: A4005",

A conference on the bills has been asked and the members of the conference committee appointed. It is my hope that these conferees will promptly report out an agreement on which the House and Senate can act and which the President will approve and I have constantly been in touch with some of the conferees on this matter. I have long endeavored to enact kgislation that will bring about costofliving relief to these people who have served their Government In many capacities over a long period of years and who have planned for and contributed to a reasonably comfortable community life. I think the provisions being studied in conference are badly needed and. to some extent. provide the additional A4013 income these people so justly deserve. Both in the 84th and 85th Congress I have introduced similar legislation affecting retirees which fully indicates my belief and concern in their welfare. The west coast of Florida is one of the great retirement sections of the United States and many of our fine residents are from the ranks of retired civil employees. The action proposed in these two bills before the conferees is extremely important to the future of these retirees and their Tetirement communities. I hope that every effort will be made to obtain a conference report at the very earliest opportunity. I trust that the bill will be reported out soon. that it will provide an amount approximating S. 72 and will provide an increase that will thus adequately compensate for the increased cost of living that so markedly affects the standard of living of these retirees on fixed incomes. This was the intended purpose of my bill and I trust the conferees will consider this factor. of increased cost of living. the principal and motivating element in their deliberations. there being adequate funds in the trust fund to provide an increase in conformity with this principal and still retain the actuarially sound integrity of the fund. \"May Day\" Proclaimed \"Law Day\"",

Before that first year of honeymooning was over. we added two assistant Cabinet members to every member of the Cabinet. That ran into a lot of money. I am for this bill. Africa is tremendously important to us and the creation of an Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. whether we call it that or give it no name. it is that. is going to do us tremendous good.

Africa was under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Near Eastern. South Asian. and African Affairs. So. in reality. Africa was receiving only onethird of the attention of the Assistant Secretary of State in charge. This placed upon him too great a burden. since he had to consider the problems of India. Ceylon. Afghanistan. the whole Middle East. as well as Africa. There is no question concerning Africas growing importance to the United States. We all know Tunisia. Morocco. Libya. Ghana. and the Sudan have already received their independence. and it is contemplated other areas will become selfgoverning in the near future. Africa is important to us politically. economically. and militarily. We are all aware of the political tensions in Africa and the attempts of the Communists to win over large portions of this area. We recognize the importance of the critical materials located there thatare so necessary for our industries. such as cobalt. uranium. diamonds. and so forth. We have important military bases in Libya. Morocco. and Ethiopia. It is. therefore. commonsense to have an Assistant Secretary of State who will devote his full time to the problems of Africa.

In 1956 the ratio of addicts to the total population was 1 to every 3.000 persons as compared with the ratio of 1 to every 10.000 at the end of World War II. We were also alarmed to learn that of the approximately 60.000 narcotic addicts in the United States in 1956. 13 percent were under the age of 21 years. Statistics will prove that today. since the enactment of Public Law 728. our national narcotic problem is vastly improved. We feel this improvement is a direct and proximate result of the passage of that law which contained not only minimum mandatory penalties. but penalties calibrated in severity of multiple convictions. The 1956 law also contained a provision which foreclosed the power of the courts to suspend sentences and grant probation. Accordingly. Mr. Chairman.

I want the record to be clear that. as I stated earlier in this debate. I feel Title I sales for soft currency surely ought to have a priority type of treatment. The most important sale is for dollars. The second is for soft currency. High in the same category is barter. So if the Secretary has any doubt about how the Senator from Minnesota feels. I hope this discussion will dispel that doubt. I feel the questioning by the Senator from Ohio has been very helpful. I think whenever we can make dollar sales. we ought to pursue them.",

Remember. if it was in Great Britain. for example. and the price was equal between the United States and a Commonwealth country. the Commonwealth country would get the business. So we would not have had a cash sale if the cash prices had been equal. When we talk about displacing American dollar sales. I point out that we cannot displace dollar sales if we were not going to get the sales. and we would not get them unless the price and quality were right. The evidence which the traders have given is quite important. They are not all cheering for barter. Every one of the companies. except one. said they were essentially cash traders. However. they said bartering aided them in cash deals. That was the testimony of representatives of the Crofton Grain Co.. the Continental Grain Co.. and one or two others. who appeared before the committee. We had a half dozen or more such witnesses before the committee. We heard a representative of the Bunge Corp.. which is one of the largest companies in the world. It is an international company. Every witness said without exception that there was no evidence which might be called conclusive that bartering displaced cash sales. but everyone said there was evidence barter assisted in the sales program and provided a good market.",

A rumor spread through the market that the provision advocated by the Senator from Minnesota might be incorporated in the extension of Public Law 480. and feed grains might be purchased in Germany at from 4 to 10 percent less than the normal export price. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture in Germany has had many calls this morning. and has asked the State Department to find out what the situation is and report back to them. so that they can report to the Germans who are interested in the matter. I also wish to say that international traders working through barter. apparently did go into Western Europe last year and the year before. and slashed the price of grainI do not know whether it was from 4 to 10 percent. or how muchto such an extent that we narrowly avoided devastating trade war with Canada. Australia. and other countries. I am sure if the provision in the bill under consideration is adopted. we will be in a trade war. While we may sell a little more barley to Germany by reason of the provisionand barley is the commodity they have in mindwe will immediately be in a devastating trade war. which will force down the price of our wheat. When we get into a trade war involving wheat. we will get the short end of it. The situation was so bad last year as a result of bartering that the topflight officials of Canada insisted on meeting with the topflight officials of the United States. and they entered into an understanding to the effect that the United States would stop the cutthroat trading in Western Europe. which is demoralizing not only that market but our market and the Canadian market.

One of the questions the Senator addressed to me wasDoes the Senator feel that sale abroad takes precedence over free distribution in this country. -when free distribution is needed by many of the people dwelling here? My answer was. in effect. that the Secretary should without doubt. in my judgment. use commodities in surplus for home consumption if there is need for it. rather than to contract for their sale abroad. When I gave the answer. Mr. President. I had overlooked the fact that under date of February 3 I had written the Department of Agriculture suggesting the possibility of obtaining additional surplus foods. especially fats and butter. for distribution to economically distressed families in Louisiana. I received an answer which came to my attention only this morning. In the last paragraph of the letter appears the following: The Commodity Credit Corporation has at the present time 56 million pounds of butter in inventory. Your inquiry. therefore. as to the availability of butter for distribution to needy persons is thoroughly understandable. This butter has been under constant review for several weeks. However. in view of the needs for schoollunch programs (approximating 65 million pounds annually) and for charitable institutions. and for foreseeable sales programs. we have thus far. not felt that stocks have been sufficient to begin general distribution to needy persons. It would appear unwise to start such donations without being relatively certain that current stocks and prospective accumulations will permit distribution over a reasonable period to needy families in all participating States. That paragraph seems to be at variance with what we were discussing yesterday. but during the colloquy and thereafter I was notified by the Department of Agriculture that butter would be made available immediately to needy families in Louisiana. I presume the same thing applies to the cases cited by my good friend from West Virginia.",

I am sure that he is perhaps more familiar with the sweatshoplabor practices in Japan than I am. I could not defend these labor practices or the importation of cheap labor rates from abroad. I would. however. like to state that I have 12 hardwoodplywood plants located in my Congressional District. The largest hardwood plywood plant in the world is going to be shut down on Friday. It is going to be shut down primarily because of competition from Japan. The comparisons which the gentleman tried to make between hardwood and softwood plywood and putting these statistics together is like comparing oranges with popsicles. There is no comparison. There are a great many employees that are concerned with the fact that in 9 years Japan has taken over onehalf of the hardwoodplywood market in the United States. They have come from 6 percent of the market 9 years ago to onehalf of the hardwoodplywood market today. I am sure that the gentleman would not want to face up to the 1.000 employees of the Roddis Plywood Corp. and make the same kind of a speech before them that he has made here today in behalf of Japanese imports of plywood and Japanese plywood workers.",

If there is a need. such as the need for financial security because of some emergency. the need is usually met by private companies and groups which act on a private basis to satisfy the demand on the part of the American public. I was interested. therefore. to hear from Mr. Robert R. Neal. general manager of the Health Insurance Association of America. with regard to the growth of the important industry represented by his association in looking after the wellbeing of American families. For example. last year. to the people of Wisconsin. no less than $59.7 million was paid in benefits. so as to cover bills resulting from illness. and to replace the income lost thereby. Let me reemphasize that we of the United States do not believ in having the Government do for the people what the people should at. least try to do for themselves. We recognize that government has an Important role to play in many areas of our way of life. But we infinitely prefer to have the needs met. insofar as humanly possible. by private groups. such as the private insurance industry.

R. 11378 which would extend and amend the programs of financial assistance in the construction and operation of schools in areas affected by Federal activities. The Presidents budget message of February 13. 1958. recommending drastic cutbacks in this program came as a shock to many of us here. While certain organizations had been advocating the curtailment or the elimination of this program. few of us would have believed that the President would have followed such siren voices at a time when all evidence pointed to the fact that morenot lessassistance was needed by the American educational system. There seems little room to quibble as to the Federal responsibility in this particular area. In this program. Federal aid follows Federal impact in a direct cause and effect relationship. Simple justice and equity requires that the Federal Government assume the burden of assisting those localities where the Federal Governments own actions have created the problem. To my own State of Oregon. the existing programs have been of great assistance. From 1953. through 1957. there have been 251 eligible applicants under Public Law 874 receiving a total of $2.340.252.28. During the same period under Public Law 815. there were a total of 24 applicants receiving a total of $1.288.527. These are not insignificant sums in the total outlay of funds for education in Oregon. For the Federal Government to cause such an additional outlay of State and local funds without reimbursement would be grossly unfair. I am pleased. therefore. that the House Committee on Education and Labor. of which I am a member. has reported this bill. H. R. 11378. to extend and amend the Federally impacted areas laws. I hope that the House will speedily pass this bill. Because American education stands today at the crossroads. America itself stands at the crossroads. The very security of our Nation in the future depends on how fully each level of governmentFederal. State and local--carries out the definite responsibilities it bears to assist in the highest intellectual attainment of our youth. If we are weighed and found wanting in fulfilling these responsibilities. then America is in grave peril. The bill before us is but one smallalthough importantarea where such responsibilities must be carried out. Its enactment will authorize the continuation of programs most vital to American education.",

Richard Frankensteen. and many others. were beaten almost to a pulp at an overpass to an entrance to the Ford plant in Detroit. I hold in my hand a book written by Harry Bennett. for many years chief of staff for Henry Ford. It is an amazing book. He states that thousands of former criminals were taken on to the Ford payroll over the course of years. that an undercover system was maintained. that close and intimate contact was maintained with the underworld. and with leaders of the underworld. and that the company was informed as to what was happening in the plant at all times. Chapter 11 of the book begins with these words: Our contracts with the underworld often led people to ask us for help. The book is filled with statements to this effect. All this was in the period when the Ford Co. was fighting the unions. I think the RECORD should. however. be clear and complete. It is to the great credit of Edsel Ford. Mrs. Edsel Ford. and Henry Ford II. that they were always opposed to these practices. and that as soon as Henry Ford II could obtain control of the company. he ousted Mr. Bennett. with the aid of his mother. the widow of Edsel Ford. I think the record of the Ford Co.. in the past 13 years is on the whole an excellent one. but it is the record of a period during which. as the Senator from Oregon has said. the Ford Co. accepted collective bargaining. During the period in which it refused to accept collective bargaining. very different tactics were used by it. Quite apparently the Kohler Co. has believed. as honestly as Henry Ford believed. that it should not have collective bargaining. Is that correct?",

We have now completed a final tabulation. drawn from the clippings in the files of the Department of Labor. It shows that 32 men on the union sidestrikers or strike sympathizerswere killed. and seven on the employers side. namely. one in the Rice Brothers Shrimp Co. strike. one company guard. two company officials. one company worker. and one deputy sheriff in the Kentucky coal mines strike of 1941 which had earlier seen the killing of four union men. and one in the Aluminum Company strike. In two cases it is hard to tell whether the men killed were company men or union men. or victims of a straight jurisdictional conflict. It is overwhelmingly clear. however. that the preponderant proportion. 32 out of the 39 who were killed. and who can be definitely identified as on one side or the other. were union men. They did not shoot themselves. Nor were they shot by fellow union members. The charge that the CIO and Walter Reuther are responsible for these deaths reminds the senior Senator from Illinois of a cynical Italian saying that not the murderer but the murdered is guilty.

In fulfillment of that pledge I introduced a bill. in January. shortly after the Congress convened. In conclusion on this subject. let me say that this is a proposal which is peculiarly fitted to the economic difficulties in which we find ourselves. because it would not result in a drain on our budget. The proposal I have made. and the proposal which I understand Representative FORAND has made in the House. would be selffinancing. through a very modest increase in the social security tax.

Today there are an estimated 1 million schoolage children in the United States who suffer from mental retardation. This number increases annually by approximately 80.000 cases. Until the turn of the century these children were regarded with shame. and the cause of their subnormal development was shrouded in superstition and ignorance. During the past 30 or 40 years advances in medical science have brought new hope to these longforgotten children. We know now that even severely retarded children can be rehabilitated or aided through proper instruction. We have initiated programs at Federal and State levels for the care and education of the mentally retarded. However. only a beginning has been made in the vast job of fitting these children for a useful place in society. The bill which I introduce today in the Senate is similar to H. R. 3830. introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative FOGARTY of Rhode Island. long a leader in this field. It would supplement an existing program of cooperative research in the Office of Education of the Health. Education. and Welfare Department. If all our mentally retarded children are to receive the opportunity they require to develop their full capabilities. an estimated 40.000 specially trained teachers are needed. Less than half that number are now available. This bill provides for Federal assistance in the training of professional personnel in fields related to education of mentally retarded children through grants to public or nonprofit institutions of higher learning. Until our researchers have discovered methods of preventing mental retardation. we must fulfill our responsibility to these unfortunate children to help them toward a more selfsufficient existence. Let me add that my special interest in this field stems in part from the active role of Mrs. Neuberger in sponsoring successfully bills in the Oregon State Legislature to provide pilot courses for retarded children at the State level. She was the Oregon pioneer in this program. I ask unanimous consent that the bill. introduced by me for myself and my colleague. the senior Senator from Oregon . may be printed in the RECORD.",

This bill is similar to one already introduced in the House by Representative MELVIN LAIRD. of Wisconsin. All too frequently in the past we have made inadequate provisions for the school milk program. We have not granted sufficient funds. nor have we had any kind of a longrange program. By extending the current provisions until 1960. the program will be able to function a great deal more effectively. and adequate planning and distribution will be assured. The sum has been settled upon after extensive hearings held in the House last year. I am introducing this measure in the Senate to facilitate its passage in both Houses as soon as possible. I should also like to observe that this bill is closely related to my recently introduced foodstamp bill. They will both help the farmer because of the assured and broadened markets for their products. and they also are in keeping with the general concept that since America is a land of plenty. our surplus national products should be made available to the most needy here in this country. as well as the needy abroad.",

Additional Federal payments would cover school taxes in those jurisdictions where Federal property exists. on which officers. agents. and employees of the Federal Government reside. The Federal Government now owns about onefourth of the land in the Nation. and this ownership cuts down the potential tax revenue of many localities by large amounts. In Missouri. for example. the Federal Government owns 1.641.502 acres of land. or 3.7 percent of the land area of the State. Although Missouri does not suffer loss of tax revenues from this source as much as do some other States in similar situations.

Fla.. the AFLCIO executive council adopted a most constructive and forwardlooking code of ethical practices on the administration of health and welfare funds. This code recommends to the affiliated unions of the AFLCIO not only practices of accounting and reporting to all beneficiaries of such funds. but also standards of conduct for individual officers and members of unions to avoid conflicts of interest. breaches of trust. improper fees and kickbacks. questionable investments. and other weaknesses that have characterized the administration of a few such plans. The wholehearted application of such a code will be a great protection to the beneficiaries of such plans. as well as to the good name of the labor movement. I believe it may serve as a model to other branches of industry and finance which are involved in the administration of such funds. The requirements of this code obviously go far beyond the legal requirements that would be set up in the bill I have just introduced. and I have been glad to note that the leaders of the AFLCIO also endorse the basic registration. reporting. and disclosure requirements of that bill as a legal minimum applicable to all. regardless of their acceptance of some such code.

Puerto Rico. and the Virgin Islands. are operated as a State function in cooperation with the United States Employrfient Service. In addition. the operation of these offices is coordinated with the administration of unemployment insurance. another State operation. The District of Columbia is in an unusual situation with respect to these functions. On the one hand. the statutes presently require that the United States Department of Labor operate the public employment service for the District. a practice which does not conform with the pattern throughout the rest of the country. At the same time. unemployment insurance for workers in the District of Columbia is administered. as it should be. by the District government. Thus two different jurisdictions presently administer functions whose administration should be in conjunction with each other to assure maximum benefit from both. I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill which would transfer the public employment service for the District to the District government and thereby place responsibility for the operation of the program. together with the means of carrying it out. in the hands of local rather than Federal authority. The economy and efficiency of both employment service and unemployment insurance programs should increase as a result of administration by the same authority. The proposal authorizes and directs the District Commissioners to furnish the public employment services required by the WagnerPeyser Act. To accomplish this purpose. the Commissioners are directed to establish a new agency with at least two coordinate divisions. one to administer the employment service and the other to administer the unemployment insurance functions. As at present. all employees administering these functions are to be included in the Federal civil service. No change in the cost to the Federal Government of operating this service should result from enactment of this proposal since the District will be reimbursed by the Federal Government. as are all States. of the costs of the operation. This bill. if enacted. would constitute legislation separate from the WagnerPeyser Act. but would contain certain necessary amendments of that act.",

I am sure we all realize there are certain fields in which opportunities for small business in America must be widened. My only regret is that this legislation does not include other important provisions recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Small Business last year. I realize. of course. that a taxrelief provision could not be included in a Banking and Currency Committee bill. that field Is under the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. But it is my hope that additional action by the Congress will be forthcoming on this and other recommendations. In fact. it is my intention to introduce legislation covering these remaining recommendations within the next few days. I realize other bills presently are pending in these fields. but I want to reemphasize through the introduction of such legislation the need for Congress to carry out the entire smallbusiness program. Meanwhile. I believe we Members of the House should commend the Banking and Currency Committee for its outstanding service to small business in writing this legislation which we now are considering. The committees work indicates deserved recognition of the vital role small business has played in our economy throughout our Nations history. As the committee noted in its report: Small business is a symbol of opportunity. enterprise. innovation. and achievement. It is an independent way of life. standing for something quite essential to our freedom. Certainly. we should do all that is possible to encourage smallbusiness concerns. to help them grow and expand. This bill is a forward step in realizing that objective. In this legislation. we make the Small Business Administration a permanent agency. we authorize more loans to small business. we give small business greater assistance in obtaining a greater and fairer share of Government procurement. and we reduce the interest rate on Small Business Administration loans. Such actions. I am certain. will help small business in important areas. They will help establish and preserve a healthy economic climate for small business.

Due to the drought conditions. and the storms which we have been experiencing of late. it has been necessary to extend this type of assistance to several organizations within my district.

If the company and all of its affiliates have more than 500 employees. it may be big business. or. may still be small business. I think the determining factor is not the number of employees but the overall picture. whether the company and its affiliates are independently owned and are they dominant in the Industry. plus all the other pertinent and relevant facts and factors in the industry and in the particular firm. This Is a situation about which we must be very careful. If General Motors. and I do not name it. in any invidious sense. started to manufacture some item and Its production constituted only onetenth of 1 percent of the production of the particular Item in the whole field. and a procurement is set aside for small business in that field. General Motors cannot come in and compete for that item. General Motors is big business whether they are making this little item in competion with small business or not. SBA must take into account the overall picture. SBA should consider the number of employees. but only as one of the many criteria. It is only one of the criteria to be taken into account. It must not be the overriding or controlling one. It should not be the one that will conclude the whole problem. They must look at all the facts and circumstances in the industry and in the particular company and its affiliates. then make a determination.",

I have had any number of businessmen who have applied for loans from the Small Business Administration complain that they could get a loan if they had security and they could get a loan if it was a loan which was certain to be repaid. I note in this bill on page 13. subsection (1) says: No financial assistance shall be extended pursuant to this subsection unless the financial assistance applied for is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. I note also on page 16. subsection 7 states: All loans made under this subsection shall be of such sound value or so secured as reasonably to assure repayment. Now I ask the gentleman from New York if these two sections are not. for all practical purposes. contradictory in terms. In other words. if you have a loan which is of such a sound value as to be reasonably sure of repayment. or one which is secure. can you not in almost all cases get a loan from some other source and therefore be ineligible to receive a Small Business Administration loan?",

In those instances the borrower would be precluded from getting a loan in his own area. There are other instances in many other States where the banking authorities frown on longterm loans. They will not permit a loan to go beyond 2 or 3 years as a maximum on these business loans. You will find many small businesses that will need a loan and cannot possibly repay it in 1. 2. or 3 years. It is in the nature of a capital loan. It .is for machinery that will never be able to be paid for within 1 or 2 or 3 years. but can be amortized only out of earnings in a period of 5. 6. or 10 years. They could not qualify as far as the local bank is concerned. to get the loan. but they can qualify under this program. I will say to the gentleman that we. the committee. believe that the agency has been a little too stringent. too strict. -in the way it has revised some of these loans. We tried not to put ourselves in the position of the lending officer. That is a judgment that will have to be exercised by the agency. But within the criteria that we have laid down. the standards set down in the statute. we think the agency has been a little too strict in making some of these loans. That was one of the points I was making as my time ran out. They are going way beyond what we intended. That language in the statute comes out of the old RFC Act.",

The Committee on Banking and Currency. whose chairman is the renowned and distinguished gentleman from Kentucky . whose many outstanding contributions to the greatness of America are a matter of record. has reported in H.

As our Nation has developed its economy and expanded its population. the opportunities for the entrepreneurlike a Henry Forddecrease almost in ratio to the growth of larger industries. The demands of these larger industries for capital and credit foreclose this source to small business. The need for Government to keep open the avenue from which we obtain those who bring initiative. vision. and courage and develop new ideas. new ways. and new industries. is clearly apparent and vital. The smallbusiness man is the source from which we draw our strength. I take advantage of this opportunity to express the deep appreciation of the people of Hawaii to the very able and dedicated gentleman from New York. . Due to his vision and broad interest in the economy of the United States and in every part of the United States. Hawaii has today a Small Business Administration.

My people are con4. sumers and their interests are consumers interests. Some may think it inexpedient. therefore. that I have several times recently attacked the ruthless agriculture policies of Ezra Taft Benson and his boss. President Eisenhower. In certain quarters. the illusion exists that flexible price supports favor the consumer. And so. while farm area representatives rail against the inequities and iniquities of Bensonism. urban Congressmen are expected to follow meekly along. I believe. -however. that the good health of the American economy is indivisible. that it is impossible to favor the consumers by punishing the farmers. I believe that as consumers. my people have much to fear from the Benson policy. the ultimate purpose of which is to drive the small farmer off the farm and into the cities. This policy not only threatens to flood the labor market in a period of dangerous labor surplus. it tends also to promote corporate farming and absentee farm ownership. a system which Americans have traditionally found abhorrent. Worse. the Benson policy has been drawn with monumental insensitivity to the personal hardships it necessarily implies. I readily admit to a lack of expertise on the farm question. I have my doubts about the validity of rigid parity supports as a total solution. and at the first opportunity. I believe Congress must undertake a Drofound and basic restudy of the problem. NonethelesS. in the light of current economic conditions and because of the demonstrated futility of the Benson program. I believe that price supports must be frozen at their current levels as provided In the resolutions which passed the House and Senate recently.

In other words. the Department expects to continue to ignore the farmers needs for higher prices and the needs of our less fortunate citizens for a better diet. The administration has asked that the States undertake to extend unemployment compensation payments for 13 weeks with funds advanced by the Federal Government. Members of Congress have proposed a 16week extension financed by the Federal Government itself. I do not intend to argue the merits of these two proposals at this time. Unemployment insurance benefits are expiring now at a rate close to 150.000 a month. Whether the benefits are extended for 3 months in part of the States under the administration proposal. or 4 months throughout the Nation. under the alternative proposal. it appears inevitable that next August and September. after the extended benefits have expired. we still will have many hundreds of thousands of families without any income whatsoever. The United States cannot afford to have surplus foodstuffs accumulating on farms or in storehouses. and causing great farm suffering. while millions of our citizens are poorly and inadequately fed. It is difficult to understand why the Government would freeze available funds in the face of such a serious situation. instead of using those funds to transfer the food to needy people. The measure Senator SCOTT and I introduce is intended to instruct Secretary Benson to use section 32 funds for the purposes intended. to help the farmers and to feed the needy. to keep available approximately $64 million which would otherwise revert to the Treasury next July 1. and to demonstrate that the attitude of the Secretary of Agriculture toward our aged. our handicapped. and the innocent victims of the current recession is not the attitude of our Government. Mr. President. the Senator from North Carolina and I cordially invite the cosponsorship of other Senators of this measure to help our farmers and our needy citizens.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. Congress today is hurrying to pass a bill to restrict the Supreme Courts recent decision in the Jencks case which held that Federal Bureau of Investigation reports. under certain circumstances. could be made available to defendants in criminal cases. The Courts view was based on the longestablished right to counsel to impeach an opposing witnessthat is. destroy his credibilityby producing earlier statements by him which may be at variance with court testimony. But in the Jencks case the Supreme Court made this right of counsel specifically applicable to the hitherto sacrosanct files of the FBI. Up to then the FBI had always been able to maintain that its files must be kept secret. Since the Jencks case was decided. J. Edgar Hoover and Justice Department officials have been pressing for legislation to change the Jencks ruling. It is extremely unfortunate. Mr. Chairman. that this pressureexerted through press. radio. and other mediumshas resulted in eleventhhour consideration of the bill before us. Because high administration officials have hinted broadly that the Jencks case opens FBI files to every whim and demand of defendants in espionage and other cases involving our national security. the legislative skids have been greased. the adjournment flag has been readied. and word has gone out that the bill is not really too bad after all. Mr. Chairman. I am opposed to the legislation at hand because I do not believe that it has received sufficient consideration and because I resent the atmosphere in which it comes to this body. I feel strongly that Congress. with the perspective that comes from studying the effects of the Jencks decision. will be better able to legislate in the public interest on this matter in the next session of the Congress.",

Mr. Chairman. it should be realized that the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York would definitely affect and bring into play the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. If you read his amendment you will see that it says: In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States. no statement or report of a Government witness or prospective Government witness (other than the defendant) made to an agent of the Government which is in the possession of the United States shall be the subject of subpena. or inspectionAnd here is the languageexcept. if provided in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. That is except if provided in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Here is an indirect way to give lower Federal judges an additional post on which to hang their hats to compel the production of FBI records. not by virtue of the Jencks case. but \"if provided in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\" Of course. the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not have any provision for discovery. properly speaking. That applies only in civil cases. For example. in a criminal case the defendant charged with crime has the right before trial to ask the Federal Government to produce to him and his counselwhat?-papers. books. documents. and other tangible evidence belonging to the defendant. In other words. if the defendants books have been taken. if he has made a confession. he has the right to have those documents submitted to him. But certainly under the Rules of Criminal Procedure you have never heard of a right given to the defendant to go to the United States Attorney and say. \"Look here. before I go to trial I want to see your files. I want to see the FBI reports. I want to know who the witnesses are going to be.\" I say this is a temptation to the lower Federal judges to try to find another way to get at these reports indirectly when the idea of the bill is to stop it.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. under leave to extend my remarks in the RECORD. I include the following editorial from the New York Times. which discusses the question of how big a flag should be: A FLAG The question has been raised in a recent news story in this paper as to how big is a flag. There is no standardsize American flag. The main criterion is that the flags width be twothirds of the length. We think that there are certain general dimensions. however. that should be observed. A flag is a symbol. of course. and as such it should represent the qualities for which it stands. Consequently it can be large or small. It should be large enough to deserve respect and allegiance wherever it is flown. But it should not be so big that it can serve as a ready shield for scoundrels. the intemperate. or the ignoble. It must not be so small that it is easily forgotten in the times or places where liberty is a dim and distant thing. It must be large enough to win a place dear to the hearts of its sons and daughters. But it should not be so big that its sight strikes terror and fear where it is shown. It should be large enough to cover all its people. not just the few. It should not be so small that it is easily waved in moments of wild. careless enthusiasm for causes that in a more sober. reflective moment would be rejected as unworthy. It matters little if a flags history is long or short. its colors bright or pale. its design simple or complex. What matters is that where the banner waves those who live under it dwell in peace. in liberty. and in justice. Tom Tandy Retires After 75 Years in Vanishing Occupation",

From a tiny fishing village of barely 600 population Miami Beach has grown to a thriving city of 60.000 which plays host to 1% million visitors annually. I want to take this opportunity to extend my heartiest congratulations to all the officials and citizens of Miami Beach who have helped make this fabulous growth possible. Only a few years ago Miami Beach was generally thought of as only a winter resort. Today the advantages of its spectacular location and unsurpassed climate have made it famous the world over as a yearround vacation spot. The vision and foresight of the early city fathers has been more than vindicated. Where formerly there had been only mangrove swamp and sand dunes there is now a modern resort city of palmlined boulevards. multimilliondollar hotels and apartments. fine shops. and beautiful homes. Since 1935 more hotels have been built in Miami Beach than in most of the rest of the entire United States. Today Miami Beach has over 370 hotels. with a total of 30.000 rooms. The city itself owns 706 acres of public parks. including eight beaches and 15 playA2445 grounds. With its two municipal auditoriums. many hotel meeting rooms. and outstanding accommodations for visitors Miami Beach has become Americas most modern convention city. All this. plus an absence of soot. smoke. smog. or snow. makes Miami Beach an ideal place whether for permanent residence or for a relaxing vacation. It is a pleasure to extend birthday greetings to one of the truly fabulous cities of the world. Our Post Office Worries",

An item appearing in the Des Moines Register. March 24. 1957. brings to light some of the aspects of this condition. The item follows: MILK MARKET \"BiGs\" BATTLE THE \"LIr.Es\" The Iowa milk market is churning. with rugged economic battles reportede between \"big dairies\" and \"little dairies.\" A supermarket was selling milk from a distant \"little dairy\" at three halfgallons for $1. Since a week ago Saturday. the supermarket sells only milk from a nearby \"big dairy\" at three halfgallons for $1.26. The supermarket managers mind was changed when a group of protesting farmers who sell milk to the big dairy came in that Saturday and bought up the stores entire stock of milk that came from the small \"outside\" dairy. \"When they came in and bought us out. we quit.\" said the store manager. \"We dont handle that (small dairys milk) anymore.\" The manager said he received protests from some customers with large families that buy a lot of milk. \"We have to string along with the farmers because theyre a big part of our business.\" the manager said. One Iowa supermarket operator reportedly was given $500 by a dairy to sell only that dairys milk. In another instance. the pressure came from the supermarket operator. This store manager. in northern Iowa. reportedly offered a dairy representative exclusive rights in his store if the dairy would put a new Buick in my driveway in place of the old one thats there now.

In placing this in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD here with my remarks. I do so with the hope that every Member of the Congress will take a few moments to read it and study it through. Particularly. I hope so much the distinguished Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the United States Supreme Court read it and give serious thought to its meaning. Surely. men of such great intellect and learning in the law as those who constitute the Supreme Court could find within the boundaries of the Constitution of the United States the authority to protect our form of government from treacheries and subversive forces determined to destroy it from within. The Bill of Rights. constituting as it does a part of this noble document. must be preserved. but unless this Nation and its form of government is protected and preserved. the Bill of Rights will cease to have meaning. The rights of the individual are dependent upon the form of government. Individual liberty without freedom is meaningless. Communism is the enemy of the free way of life. Communism has announced its intention to destroy freedom everywhere. Recognizing no God. communism is determined to destroy the United States of America. the very citadel of freedom. Communism. like cancer. is formed of small cells within the body of national society. As soon as these cells are strong enough they begin to destroy.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. no thinking person can brush aside the need for legislation such as we have before us today in H. R. 7963. It exemplifies keen foresight and broad understanding of the problems of small business on the part of the gentleman from Kentucky and the members of the House Banking and Currency Committee. The economic plight of small business. especially in the rural areas is alarming. Failures are rising at an alarming rate. Even considering the Nation as a whole. they increased substantially in 1956 over 1955. Furthermore. statistical surveys of the first quarter of 1957 show that this upward trend is continuing at an alarming rate. One of the most acute problems the smallbusiness man faces today is a lack of credit. The socalled tight money policy of the administration has greatly aggravated this critical situation by drying up many normal sources of credit. Where can a merchant turn to when he urgently needs capital for inventory or expansion. Is it not the duty of a responsible Government to assist the businessman in securing operating capital when the community depends upon his services. and when his local banker has given a final \"no.\" to his request for financial aid? I believe it is. And consequently I want to say that I strongly support H. R. 7963 and earnestly hope that it shall receive overwhelming support from this great legislative body. as a demonstration of good faith in the 7 million men and women who own the Nations smallbusiness establishments and the 30 million whom they employ. It is difficult to differentiate in importance between the five major points of this measure. But I particularly like the proposal to make the Small Business Administration a permanent agency of Government as well as those provisions to expand the loaning authority of SBA and to decrease the maximum rate of interest on smallbusiness loans to 5 percent. Smallbusiness men need adequate credit. And they need it at a rate that they can afford to pay.",

As a Congressman. my views can be expressed in only one way. by the votes I cast. There are other ways to help the smallbusiness man: for example. by faster tax writeoffs which will aid him in getting bank financing. if a good risk. Also. this bill is wrong in stipulating a fixed interest rate which is completely antithetical to a free economy. where interest rates must fluctuate as demand and supply of money fluctuates. A natural followup of the fixedinterestrate policy is direct Government loans. Again. my vote is not a protest against the effort and efficiency of officials of the Small Business Administration. but is against the increasing encroachment of Federal Government in our lives. jeopardizing our very freedom and this includes economic freedom.

R. 1. as amended. approved by the House Education and Labor Committee. adheres to the basic principles which he has stressed as essential to a sound Federal schoolconstruction program. This bill makes it amply clear that there shall be no Federal control of education. It provides for a temporary. emergency program of Federal aidand that aid is only to assist in the construction of classrooms. The bill includes provisionssuch as State matching requirements and recognition of State and local effortto encourage still greater State and local contributions to school construction. It provides that Federal funds will go to those communities which are found by the States to have the most acute classroom shortages and the least local resources to meet their needs. The Presidents letter also reminds us that schoolconstruction assistance was pledged in the 1956 Republican Party platform. I hope that members of the Presidents party will respond to his leadership and support H. R. 1 as amended. I also hope that Members of the House from both parties will unite behind this bill and oppose any crippling amendments which may be offered. The education of millions of children continues to suffer because of halfday school sessions. jampacked classrooms. and dilapidated facilities. Further delay in meeting this classroom shortage will not only penalize the children concerned but also complicate this and other national education problems.

Perhaps a lot of the difficulty comes about because of disorganization within the States themselves and what their different localities want of the Federal Government. For instance. I have received from 30 to 35 individual requests from heads of bureaus and departments of the State and couniy government in California asking for various types of Federal aid. even wanting an extension of the school milk program in junior colleges. Then in the matter of the soil bank when they heard that there were three new soilbank laboratories to be established. they wanted to get one for California. Perhaps it would be a good idea for the governors to get these problems straightened out in their own administrations. see that their administrations are coordinated and correlated in their requests for things that are necessary.",

I desire to call attention to the status of the veterans bills which were introduced in the present session of Congress to provide readjustment benefits to veterans of peacetime service. These bills were referred to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare at the beginning of this session. and are now pending before the Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs. of which I am chairman. As Senators know. these bills raise a fundamental policy question which the Congress must decide. Never before in our history has the United States. during peacetime. had compulsory military service. In recognition of the Nations responsibility to our men and women who served in the Armed Forces during wartime. Congress has enacted a great variety of legislation for war veterans. including. in our generation the GI bill of rights for World War II and Korean veterans. The question confronting us today is whether some or all of the readjustment benefits granted to veterans who served in wartime should be made available to the millions of young Americans who. under the Selective Service Act. are required to serve in the Armed Forces during peacetime. Many young veterans anxiously await the outcome of this question. and I regret that it could not be resolved at this session of Congress. Unfortunately. however. although extensive hearings on the bills have been held. there are still a few factual questions to be explored. In addition. because of the recent reduction both in the Armed Forces and in the monthly callups under the draft law. the subcommittee desires to have more uptodate cost estimates than those provided during the hearings. It is quite possible that cost estimates projected from say October or November of this year. will show a substantial reduction in the cost estimates now on hand. The subcommittee has. therefore. instructed its staff to develop these matters while the Senate is in adjournment. so the necessary information will be available for immediate use when the Senate reconvenes in January. Meanwhile. I hope Senators will be able to devote some time to the study of this very important proposed legislation concerning our young men and women in the service. I also hope Senators will be able to review the hearings. which will be available for distribution either shortly before or shortly after the adjournment.",

Mr. President. this letter speaks for itself. It is its own explanation. As of August 20. 1957. 8 days later. I had not received even an acknowledgement from H.

I ask the Secretary of State. as did other members of the joint committees. what he intended to do with or for what purposes he wanted $200 million. He certainly never gave any indication that what the Senator from Kentucky has proposed was the sort of thing he had in mind. Already $750 million has been authorIzed and appropriated in the mutualaid bills for this general area. What the resolution does is simply to enable the Secretary to take $200 million of the $750 million and release him from any restriction and allow him to do with it what he pleases. In all fairness. I cannot believe that is looking toward the kind of project the Senator from Kentucky has mentioned. The formulation of programs to reach the problems the Senator from Kentucky has mentioned is a plan upon which I certainly would look with a sympathetic eye. But I cannot believe that the joint resolution proposes any such thing. Nothing of the sort is indicated in it. Certainly the President could not spend $200 million on such programs between now and July 1. such programs could scarcely be drawn up by that time.",

In regard to the matter referred to. the Senate voted for the Vandenberg resolution. with only two or three members not voting in favor of it. The action taken in that case was comparable to the action which I believe should be taken in the present case. Subsequently. and I would say in pursuance of the Vandenberg resolution. the Senate ratified the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or Treaty. and did so very formally. with twothirds of the Members of the Senate approving. All of that was done under the Constitution. in the most regular fashion. In pursuance of that Treaty. we further authorizedand. as I recall the debate. it was understood that the President was being given the rightto decide on the sending of troops. We voted to give the President that right. There is no question about that procedure. In the present case. I am arguing. not about the objective. but about the procedure proposed to be followed. I think the two cases are entirely different. If the President submitted to us a joint resolution requesting from us such authority. under a treaty which we would consider in the normal way. that would be quite a different matter. But in the present case we have a joint resolution. not a treaty. furthermore. the joint resolution does not specify anything. really. It uses the vaguest kind of language. it does not specify any of the detailssuch as those involved in the sending of troops to Europe. Or. Mr. President. to use another instancenot a precedent. as it has been referred toin carrying out the Truman doctrine the Congress passed a formal. specific piece of legislation quite similar to our foreignaid legislation. and it specified in detail just what should be done. In that case it provided that the President was authorized to send to Greece. to act there in an advisory capacity only. certain civilian and military personnel. That measure was limited in that way.

Unfortunately. that opportunity will now be denied us. Ramon Magsaysay. however. will continue to live on. not only in the hearts of his own countrymen. but also in the hearts of the people of Asia and of America and of Europe who love human freedom. He was truly a man of the people. He had fought against the aggressor in the Philippines during World War II. He had taken an active part in bringing selfgovernment back to the people of the Philippines. He had been Governor of his Province. He had been selected as the Secretary of National Defense. In that position he had been given a responsibility to make certain that the election of the country would be conducted freely and that the citizens would have an opportunity to express themselves. In that regard his performance was outstanding. Subsequently. in a great free election by the people of the Philippines. he was elected President of the Philippine Republic. He had almost served out his first term. and the next election was to be held in November of this year. Mr. President. Ramon Magsaysay was a true friend of the United States. He recognized the community of interests between the Philippines and the United States. He was a believer in human freedom everywhere in the world. Of course. the people of his country will sorely miss him. but the fjundation he laid will not be dissipated merely because of his death. Indeed. Ramon Magsaysay will live on into eternity. I am sure that all Members of this body. of both great political parties. join in extending deepest sympathy to the people of the Philippines and to President Magsaysays family.",

The pangs of grief are particularly sharp to the United States. which has had such a close relationship to the Philippines. and under whose tutelage the Philippine people passed from Spanish colonial dependency to independence. President Magsaysay was a fighter for freedom and the foremost opponent of communism in the Far East. He carried his experience as an opposition leader to the Japanese occupation into the struggle against Communist infiltration. and won resounding triumphs against both. His executive and political ability was especially demonstrated in his concern for the little man. It was this interest which was translated into the action that overwhelmed the Huks and united the nation behind him. \"The big people always manage to take care of themselves.\" he said. \"and if I did not help the little people. then the Communists would.\" His miraculous rise from automobile mechanic before World War 11 to President in 1953 is an inspiring testament to the fact that his people got to know and to trust and love him as he proceeded to clean out corruption in the Army and initiate community programs for their benefit. He was only 49 at the time of his tragic death. and his tenure of office was relatively short. but his political magnetism and his love for freedom so affected the Philippine people that both Americans and Filipinos alike look forward with confidence to a continuation In the future of the close and profitable relationship which has marked our friendship in the past. I should like to add a personal word to my statement. It was my privilege about 2 years ago to be in the Philippines with Secretary of State Dulles.

Last October. during an inspection trip in the far Pacific. I spent 4 days in the islands. and enjoyed two conferences with the late President to discuss some of the problems confronting his country. He proudly recounted the progress being made toward economic rehabilitation and the establishment of sound principles of selfgovernment. He recognized the friendly cooperation of the United States. expressing hope that any temporary friction between the two countries would be satisfactorily settled. Despite charges of political opponents that he was too strongly proAmerican. President Magsaysay was dedicated to safeguarding individual rights in the full utilization of national resources. He realized that independence of his beloved Republic could best be served by maintaining close ties with the United States. This intense devotion to western ideology made him an outstanding leader in eastern Asia in resisting Communistic subversion. Filipinos revered this dynamic and popular president. and although loss of his leadership will be a serious blow to his countrymen. they will be inspired to attain those objectives which made President Magsaysay one of the great leaders of this generation.

It has deprived the forces of freemen everywhere of a powerful proponent in the unending conflict with totalitarianism. The death of Ramon Magsaysay is a severe loss. But death. Mr. President. is not one sided. It gives as it takes. In claiming the President of the Philippines at the age of 49. it leaves his restless spirit of liberty as a richer heritage for all mankind. To the Filipino people. death leaves the image of a man who knew that freedom was little more than a word unless it touched the weak as well as the strong. unless it reached down to the last rice farmer in the smallest barrio in the islands. The life and Presidency of Ramon Magsaysay were dedicated to giving meaning to freedom. The Filipino leaders who come after him will serve their people the better for his having lived. For the United States and other western nations. Ramon Magsaysay will remain a lasting symbol of the universality of freedom. He reached above the barriers of differing culture and race to clasp our hand in common devotion to democratic principles.

I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD and appropriately referred a joint memorial of the Montana State Legislature requesting the Federal Government to make effective the OMahoneyMillikin amendment to the Flood Control Act of 1944. The OMahoneyMillikin amendment reserved waters arising in arid and semiarid Western States for beneficial uses in those States. In recent years. water has been released from the upper Missouri Basin to benefit navigation in the Mississippi River and to prevent a salt water incursion into the New Orleans city water system. at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico. While many of us are gratified that Missouri Basin development has advanced to the point that citizens all down the Mississippi River can benefit from it. the water releases have resulted in critically low pools behind Missouri Basin dams. There is a prospective deficit of electric power to meet the firm power commitments of the Bureau of Reclamation to rural electric. municipal and commercial customers. This memorial of the Montana Legislatureand a similar memorial has been adopted by the South Dakota Legislatureurges a congressional review of Missouri River management which I hope the Public Works and Interior Committees may undertake jointly. just as we have studied jointly the problem of cost allocation of multiplepurpose water projects. There is great need for constructive solutions to problems of water scarcity in many areas of the Nation. The Missouri Basin problem is an immediately pressing one. Although we have not approached maximum use of upper Missouri Basin water for irrigation. there are already growing conflicts between uses for water which must be resolved. These conflicts between uses appear to require a choice of one use or the other as superior. but a choice between two needs is not an adequate solution. The real solution is in finding ways to meet all the needs. not merely one or another of them. With an integrated development of all the resources of the Missouri Basinincluding its vast lignite deposits as well as flowing water for energyall needs could be met. I make this statement now in the hope that when hearings are held on the problem posed by the Montana and South Dakota memorials. all those involved will deal with meeting our total needs and not simply with how to ration a scarcity of water.",

At present a 10day notice of the first meeting of creditors. at which the bankrupt is examined. must be sent by the court to all interested parties. Not until the examination of the bankrupt has been completed can the court fix by order a last day for filing objections to the bankrupts discharge. At that point. a second separate notice must be sent to all interested parties. The amendment proposed by H. R. 5811 would permit these two notices to be combined into one in approximately 75 percent of ordinary bankruptcy cases. In such cases the notice of the first meeting of creditors would also state the last day for the filing of objections to the discharge of the bankrupt. Should the examination of the bankrupt continue beyond the day fixed for his discharge that date could be extended. Mr. Speaker. I urge the enactment of H. R. 5811. not only because it would contribute to a more efficient procedure in the majority of bankrupt cases. but because it is bound to result in a saving of thousands of dollars year after year to the Federal Government.

Nineteen ships would go to the Republic of Germany. Greece. Netherlands. Norway. and Turkey. 21 ships will go to the Latin American countriesArgentina. Brazil. Chile. Colombia. Cuba. Peru.

The navigation of oceangoing vessels to inland ports would further the development of our agricultural and industrial potential.

The Fairchild people are now producing one. the F27. and there are a couple more that are being considered and may be developed to help provide this service. The point is. the small localservice carriers do not have sufficient capital to purchase the equipment they must have. Talking about the availability of money on the market. we find it is not so easy for people of this kind to go into the market and get money. However. if there is some incentive. some way that they can have some help. then we do think the credit will loosen up insofar as they are concerned so. therefore. we may have to utilize this program to a very limited degree.",

With the advent of jet transportation the helicopter will develop a still higher utility value as it will be necessary to develop air terminals still further removed from metropolitan areas.

Unquestionably the Supreme Court has gone far afield in some of their recent decisions. * The Association of Chief Justices continued in this resolution to express grave concern over the asserted exercise by the Court of almost unlimited policymaking powers. And they urged the Court to put on the badge of \"judicial selfrestraint.\" This committee of judges urged our Supreme Court to exercise \"one of the greatest of all judicial powersthe power of judicial selfrestraint.\" The members of our Supreme Court would do well to read the recommendations of this group in its entirety and.

The gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. AucHINCLOSS] told us that is being held in abeyance. but many of my colleagues have indicated to me that if there is going to be a new third House Office Building. then why in the world do we not wait until the new third office building is finished and ready for occupancy. Then. when it is. why cannot all these renovations. whatever they are. and if they take place in the old and present new House Office Building. then take place. instead of tearing up everybody for the next 3 years. It seems to me from what I have heard that this is the brain child of some character described as \"The Architect of the Capitol.\" He wants something to do. so he is going to get everybody busy for the next 3 years and have us running up and down these halls. Nobody is clearat least I am not. as usualas to what is going to take place around here. If the gentleman will yield further to the gentleman. from New Jersey [Mr. Au mNcLossl. If he will permit himself to be interrogated. can he tell us something about that?",

For every 3 Members who are moved out of the Old and New House Office Buildings only 2 can be moved back. as each 2room suite is to be converted into a 3room suite. There appear to be three ways in which this matter may be solved. One way would be to delay the remodeling work until the new building is completed and occupied. This plan has great disadvantages from a time element and from a cost element. Another way would be to utilize the Congressional Hotel and such additional structures as may be available for temporary housing of Members and to carry on the remodeling work in stages. perhaps 1 or 2 wings at a time. during the next 3 or 4 years. The third way would be to erect a temporary structure or structures and to move Members into these structures and the Congressional Hotel in such numbers as to permit the remodeling work in the two House Office Buildings to be carried forward during the next 2 years.

We cannot do anything to conserve game and fish by Territorial law. I would like to say that Alaska is sincerely appreciative of what this subcommittee has done in appropriating funds for the education of our natives. our Indian. and Eskimo children. We have a fine vocational high school at Sitka. Mount Edgecumbe. Soon. I hope. there will be a budgetary request for an additional school. Many children are waiting to get into high school. At Valdez. the good people of that community have offered 113 acres of land to the Federal Government. They have offered to put in all utilities. and with summer employment which will be available. this will be an excellent location for another vocational school. I want to express my gratitude to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio and to the gentleman from Iowa . and to their associates. They have been sensitive to and sympathetic toward our needs in Alaska. The face of Alaska has been altered for the better due to the attention they have paid to us and the things they have done for us.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have this day introduced legislation to provide effective safety standards in employment covered by the Longshoremens and Harbor Workers Compensation Act. This bill would amend the Longshoremens and Harbor Workers Compensation Act. which relates to private longshore and shiprepair operations within the Federal jurisdiction. to establish means for reducing the high accident rate in this employment. It would impose an obligation on stevedoring and shiprepair contractors to furnish safe employment and would authorize the Secretary of Labor to issue and enforce safety standards pertaining to their operations aboard ships and in drydocks. *1he Secretary of Labor in connection with his supervision of the compensation provisions of the Longshore Act Is presently authorized to make studies and investigations of the cause of injuries in employment covered by the act. and he may make recommendations to Congress and to interested employers and employees of means for reducing accidents. No authority exists. however. to issue or to enforce safety standards pertaining expressly to such employment. The proposal would give the Secretary such authority. but it would not extend to matters within the scope of statutes administered by the Coast Guard or regulations issued pursuant to such statutes. The extremely hazardous nature of longshore employment is reflected in the latest figures compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data which are available. while incomplete in scope. show an injury frequency rate in the stevedoring industry of 88.5 disabling injuries per million manhours worked in 1956the last year for which safety information is avaiable. In comparison. the average injury frequency rate in manufacturing was 12 in that year. The accident frequency rate in logging had for a number of years been the highest for any industry included in reports by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1956. however. the stevedoring rate of 88.5 substantially exceeded the 65 figure for logging. In operations under the Longshore Act in fiscal year 1957not reflecting operations under State compensation laws79.826 Injuries were reported. 122 of which were fatal. In that year compensation expenditures under the act. which did not include medical costs. were $8.780.437. The varying conditions of safety which exist in stevedoring operations aboard ship in the numerous ports and with different employers can be effectively improved only through the medium of a Federal law.",

I am sure this conference succeeded in alerting thinking members of the legal profession and the public to the gravity of the situation and I commend the Attorney General and his associates for the service they have rendered. The true success of the conference can only be measured. however. in terms of what it actually produces. Congress enacts a judgeship bill or bills providing for those additional judgeships recommended by the Judicial Conference of the United States. the Conference will have been a magnificent success. I hope it will be. For any who still harbor doubts as to the need for more judgeshps. I call attention to the excellent address delivered to the conference by Bernard G. Segal. chairman of the American Bar Associations Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Mr. Segal. a prominent and distinguished Philadelphia lawyer. presents a convincing and appealing case for more judgeships. This country. and the legal profession in particular. are indeed fortunate to have men such as Bernard G. Segal and others in the American Bar Association who are willing to devote so much of their time and energies to the continuous struggle to maintain a vital and independent Federal judiciary. I trust that their efforts will not be in vain. but that Congress will act now to insure all of our citizens that kind of justice which has been referred to as the keystone of Americas strength.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to urge that the House repeal the 3 percent wartime excise tax on freights which has been in effect since 1942. This tax is unfair because it discriminates against the States of the Pacific Coast and the Far West. The principal products of these States are raw materials and semiprocessed goods such as logs. lumber. shingles. plywood. and pulp. These are bulky products and their movement from the West where produced to the populous consuming centers east of the Mississippi involve long hauls often of 2.000 to 3.500 miles. Freight bills on such long distance movements of goods are unusually heavy and the 3 percent excise tax on the freight bills are a real burden. The 3 percent freight tax tends to pyramid and pyramid since freights are collected on the haul of logs from forest to factory to be processed into lumber or plywood. More freight on the lumber and plywood is paid again when these are transported to door and furniture plants. again paid when the furniture and doors are moved from factory to wholesalers and again. when shipped by the wholesalers to the retailers. The 3 percent tax on freights is burdensome and discriminatory. It is said repeal of the 3 percent freight tax will cost the treasury $450 million a year. This is an exaggeration. If repeal of the tax saves shippers $450 million that will be added to their profits and they will pay back more than $200 million of this in increased income taxes on profits. If on the other hand. shippers pass the freight savings along to consumers that will mean lower prices for consumers and consumers will buy more goods thereby increasing factory production and employment and both the companies and the workers because of increased production and employment will pay more income taxes. Repeal of the discriminatory and unfair 3 percent tax on freights will help manufacturing. will help the railroads. and will benefit workers by assurring them increased employment. Also it will tend to lower living costs and benefit the consumers of the Nation. Everyone will benefit from the repeal of the 3 percent tax on freights.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. much criticism has been leveled at the United States pavilion at the Brussels Worlds Fair. I myself have criticized one aspect of our exhibit. After many protests from leading art authorities. I sought to bring about a more representative display of American paintings than was originally planned for our pavilion. On April 9. I was informed by the United States Commissioner General. Howard S. Cullman. that exhibits of leading American artists would be shown in the official reception rooms of the commissioner general. and that some 30 other representative paintings had been borrowed and would be displayed in the official residence of the United States Ambassador for the duration of the fair. Yesterday the foolishness of this arrangement was brought home to me. A group of some 80 Americans. representative of a cross section of business. government. and the press. returned from the fair. They saw our official art exhibit at* the United States pavilion. Less than a halfdozen had a chance to see the exhibit at the Embassy and still less were afforded a view of the exhibit ini the commissioner generals office. If this is true of a group of Americans. then what opportunity does the average European visitor to the fair have to see these paintings? I am indeed disappointed that our truly American art is not available to the view of the visitor to the Brussels Fair. My section of Connecticut has long been one of the outstanding artists colonies in this Nation. The exhibit of geometrical designs and combinations of spattered colors may in truth be art to the connoiseur. But few of the 80 Americans returned proud of the exhibit. and I understand that few Europeans are impressed. As for the pavilion in general. I was pleased to learn that of 72 Americans who answered an impromptu poll taken on the airplane. 36 thought our exhibit generally excellent. 31 thought it was good. and only one thought it poor. Asked what they thought was the opinion of the average European visitor of our pavilion. 41 replied they thought the European reaction was excellent. 22 fair. 6 thought it was poor. Apparently we have done a good job. It is unfortunate. though. that Europe. the cradle of culture. is not afforded a true picture of representative American painting.",

The House Dairy Products Subcommittee heard discussions of various proposals of the National Grange. National Milk Producers. Farm Bureau. Farmers Union. and National Dairymens Association. We also heard the Secretary of Agriculture and received his recommendations in regard to dairying. After these extended hearings the Dairy Products Subcommittee worked for almost 2 weeks in executive session in an effort to work out a bill which would have the best features of all the proposals made and would be a bill upon which we. as Democrats and Republicans. could agree. There are some features of the bill which I would like to have seen strengthened. But In order to come out with positive legislation it has been necessary for both sides to agree. For the first time in many years the dairy farmer will be able to let the country know by his own vote if he wants a comprehensive dairy program. Many of the sections of the bill call for decisions on the part of the farmers themselves as to whether or not they wish to continue with the present programs or to put new ones into effect. A new dairy program is proposed in H. R. 12954 which would go into effect if a majority of the dairy farmers voted in favor of it. Because many of my colleagues. like myself. are getting inquiries about it I have worked out a set of questions and the answers on the most pertinent points. They follow:",

It allows the Navy to have transferred to it some 407 acres of land which is now under the control of the General Services Administration for use of the 1.000 Capehart units that have been approved in this bill. All this does is to expedite transfer without reimbursement by the Navy. The 1.000 units of Capehart housing can be developed on 3 pieces of property comprising 407 acres of land located within the city limits of San Diego some 5 miles north of the downtown area. These three properties were developed during the war period with defense housing. The housing has now been removed and the sites are available. Utilities and services. including some streets. are already in place. The 407 acres of land contain approximately 288 acres of land usable for housing. The transfer of this land from the Public Housing Authority to the Navy without reimbursement is desirable and necessary. It will provide land without the necessity of buying private property and removing it from the tax rolls. If the transfer were not made Without reimbursement. it would be necessary for the Navy to procure additional funds to provide for reimbursement. The 1959 budget has already been presented to the Congress and if the transfer is not made without reimbursement it might delay the construction of these urgently required Capehart housing units until next year when funds could be requested. These sites provide the best and most convenient locations for housing of this type without the necessity for purchasing extremely valuable property. No formal appraisal has been made for the value of these lands but it is estimated they are worth between $500.000 and $1 million.",

When the provision for a jury trial was first put into the law in 1914and I think we will be shown to be right on this pointit applied only in suits for injunctions brought by private persons. The distinction between civil and criminal contempt in the traditional way was not covered. but a jury trial was to be allowed only for such contempts as were crimes under statutes of the Federal Government or a State. So the statute in a way is confusing in the consideration of the issue here. when we are trying to determine what the distinction is between civil and criminal contempt. Broadly speaking. the Senator from Tennessee has been developing this matter. I think. in a very logical way. from the point of view of the definition based upon the opinion in the Gompers case and in the subsequent decisions. which are landmarks in the statement of the law on this particular point. The purpose of the civil contempt proceeding is to compel performance. Criminal contempt is involved in upholding the dignity of the court. and enforcing punishment in aid of the dignity of the court and its judicial processes. where performance is no longer possible.",

I think one thing needs to be added about the NorrisLa Guardia Act. and that is that in 1947 Congress. in effect. repealed what it had done in the NorrisLa Guardia Act. by enacting the TaftHartley law. which provides that labor injunction cases shall. in the main. be brought by the United States Government. It did not repeal that section of the law which provided that when the United States Government was a party complainant and there was ensuing contempt. there would be no jury trial. So the most recent deliberation by the Congress as an expression of intent continued the situation in which the United States Government. as a complainant. despite the fact that the law applied to labor injunctions. should not have a jury trial in an ensuing contempt proceeding. With respect to the original enactment In 1914. it is also a fact that this capped a considerable number of decades in which there had been no jury trial whatever in contempt cases. Further. in respect to labor injunctions. the Senator from Oregon . I think. made a very unusual and discerning analysis of that subject the other night. He pointed out that the great difference between an injunction in the NorrisLa Guardia Act cases and in the cases we are discussing is fundamentally thisand this was undoubtedly the reason why Congress acted as it did: In the Labor Act cases. when the judge issued an injunction. that was the end of the matter. because the strike was broken or ended then and there. the minute the injunction was issued. That is not true in the cases we are discussing. Hence. there is no special overriding reason for setting aside the idea of the Government not having a jury trial. I think Congress evidenced its real intent on that subject in 1947. In addition. there has been a great deal of loose talk to the effect that there is no constitutional or civil right to jury trial in a contempt case. I think it has been shown that there is.

But it was not held. and it has never been held. that a criminal contempt. as such. entitled the person involved to a trial by jury.

D. C. In accordance with the recommendation of the President of the United States. the Bureau of the Budget. and the House of Representatives. it is vital that construction work start at the earliest possible time on a second Washington airport. The rapid increase in \"near misses\" at the National Airport. the overcongestion and the jamming of the airways into and out of Washington National Airport. have created a critical situation which is overtaxing and overloading the personnel and electronics gear of the airways into and out of Washington National Airport. It seems to me we have paid too much attention to the political side of a Washington second airport. and too little to the need from an aeronautical standpoint. We have been told for the past 7 years. that the question must be investigated. and the subject studied further. I well remember when the Congress authorized the second construction of a second Washington airport. in September 1950. In 1951. we appropriated the first money. That money. about $1 million. was spent to acquire some land at the Burke Airport site. When the bill was reported from the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. of which the able senior Senator from Washington was chairman. it did not provide for a political selection of an airport site. It directed the Secretary of Commerce. whose Department supervises the Civil Aeronautics Administration. to investigate. study. and locate the best possible site from an engineering and aviation standpoint. to give Washington a muchneeded second air terminal.

Whether that is the correct decision. I do not know. and I do not believe any other Member of the Senate knows. But time and time again this agency of the Government has made that decision.",

I say that because. regardless of the site which is selected. there will always be people who will sayas is now being saidthat they do not want a certain site chosen because it is too close to property in which they are interested. I am convinced that if there is ever to be a second Washington airport. the decision must be made by the authorized agency. the one which has been delegated to make the recommendation. I commend the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. who probably knows more about our air problems than does any other Member of the Senate. for his diligent work as a member of the Air Subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce. He has worked diligently. not only on this problem: but on all other problems connected with our growing air age. and he has been particularly concerned about safety. I share his concern about the near misses which are happening at the Washington Airport. Do we have to wait until there is a major crash? I do not want the finger pointed at me as one who has been dragging his heels about the second Washington airport. So I commend the Senator from Oklahoma for his activity in this connection.",

Secretary Dulles has done a service to our Nation and to free peoples everywhere by bluntly stating the many reasons why Red China should not be admitted to the society of respectable nations. Red China. the Secretary said. came to power not by the will of the Chinese people but by violence. Violence is still its policy. It warred against the United Nations in Korea and has broken the armistice terms there and in Vietnam. Its announced intention is to expand by force. Trading with Red China means building up an industrial machine to support conquests dangerous to us and the whole Free World. The Secretary was extremely frank in pointing out that those nations which have recognized Red China have not changed her aggressive policies one iota. He might have added that the Red Chinese have never sent an ambassador to Great Britain. the first nation to recognize them years ago. We must all agree with the Secretary that it is against the interest of free men everywhere to deal with people who have. by their continued actions. demonstrated that they cannot be trusted.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have introduced a bill to amend the National School Lunch Act. to increase the minimum protein requirements for lunches provided under that act. This bill would increase by one ounce the minimum protein requirements for the school lunch program. which would undeniably be beneficial to the many thousands of youngsters participating in this program throughout the United States. But. more than that. this bill would provide a substantial stimulation to the farmer by providing better markets. for the food trades by increasing sales operations. the consumer by insuring the best possible value for food expenditures. and for the Nation by promoting efficient use of our abundant food production. The present law provides a minimum nutritional requirement of not less than 2 ounces of protein for the most popular type of school lunch. During the 195657 school year. there were approximately 1.8 billion meals served to school youngsters through this program. An increase of 1 ounce of protein food per meal would expand beneficial consumptive uses of lean meat. fish. poultry. and cheese in the amount of over 56.000 tons per year. I believe that early consideration and adoption of this measure would be a step in the right direction in increasing beneficial and consumptive uses of our bountiful harvest. I further believe that there are other areas wherein. with imagination. ingenuity. and conserted effort. it is possible to obtain a greater distribution and thus a greater beneficial use of our food surpluses. This program has increased in popularity with each year of operation. The school lunch program is providing in many instances the best and main meal of participating youngsters. I feel that this bill deserves the support of every Member of Congress.",

United States Steel boosted its price $6 a ton. the other steel companies will do the same thingand once more the inflation balloon has been cut loose. I was disappointed that the administration did all but put its official blessing to this steel price boost. It approved such inflationary price increases as being needed for expansion. This is regrettable. Mr. Speaker. This will be taken as the signal for a price increase by every other major industry in this country. And who suffers? The greatest sufferers today are the thousands of older citizens. Those who are living on fixed incomeswho find their food. their rents or their taxes mounting. They find that monthly check buying less and less. they find the retirement they had looked forward to is now becoming a nightmare of economic worry. And caught with them in this economic pincersthis big squeezeare the ordinary folks. the wage earner. the postal workers. the school teacher. the minister. the farmer. the small business manall of them are suffering from the evercontinuing inflationary spiral. Ill admit that some people are profiting from this economic condition. The rich are getting richeryear in and year out since this administration has taken over. the rich have become richer. the poor have become poorer. During the last 4 years the national income has gone up. but the income of small incorporated business has dropped 4.5 percent. Farmers share of the national income has dropped 36.5 percent. Yet during this same period corporation profits have gone up 16.5 percent. And interest income is up 40 percent. The banker. the financial entrepreneur have grown fat at the expense of the farmer. the little businessman. the retired grandmother and grandfather. and the rank and file of the American public. The only thing that can curb this drive to enrich the rich and impoverish the lower- and middleincome group is a complete investigation of corporate profits. The Senate Finance Committee is doing a good job as far as it goes. but we need a supplemental investigation into the spread between production costs and retail costs and into the rapidly increasing profits of the Nations moneylenders.

Total volume of 5.8 million long tons last year. a gain of 16.6 percent over Total value of foreigntrade movement $537.200.000. a gain of 11.7 percent. The port of Boston is making steady progress in spite of the fact that it has to work with one hand tied behind its back in the form of railroad freight rate discrimination. Boston is fighting to end this unfair discrimination so that it may compete on an equal basis with other ports. Boston once enjoyed advantageous shipping rates because it was closer to European and African ports. In 1935. however. a differential was imposed to give southerly ports equality with Boston. This socalled equalizing process by going too far. has placed Boston at a disadvantage. In 1935. ocean rates to and from all east coast ports were equalized. but the rail rates have not been adjusted. At the present time. railroad freight rates on import and export shipments between Boston and Midwest. are usually 2 cents per hundredweight higher than the rate between Philadelphia and such points. and 3 cents higher than the Baltimore rate. New York rates are the same as the Boston rates. This constitutes an unjust handicap. Recognizing this inequity. the district court overruled the Interstate Commerce Commission. and gave Boston and New York parity rates on grain from the Great Lakes via Buffalo. The Supreme Court later affirmed this decision. This was only a partial victory. as it applied to a single route and to a single commodity.",

It would be a tragedy. spelled with a capital T if it is closed. It has been said that the New England division of the Army engineers would go into the Waltham General Hospital if it is closed for hospital purposes. I am very much of the opinion that it will never be used by the Army engineers. and that is the report I have heard today. With all the strength of my being I implore the other body to keep Murphy General Hospital open at least for a year. I feel so sure that time will give added arguments and proof for its retention.

I am today introducing two measures designed to curb growing encroachments by the Supreme Court in the -fields traditionally and historically reserved to the States and to stop incursions by the Court in the sphere of social and other legislation. These measures were inspired by the Florida Legislature which passed memorials to Congress recommending passage of the two bills. One bill proposes \"an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which would provide that the powers reserved to the several States by the 10th amendment to this Constitution shall be construed to include. but not be limited to. power to enact laws to promote the public peace. safety. and welfare and to provide for good order. education. and harmonious race relations therein. In these enumerated fields. except where the Congress of the United States by legislation provides expressly to the contrary. the laws of each State shall govern.\" The other measure would provide that \"the Senate of the United States shall comprise a court with final appellate jurisdiction to review decisions and judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States where questions of the powers reserved to the States. or the people. are either \"directly or indirectly involved and decided and a State is a party or anywise interested in such question involved and decided. The Senates exercise of such final appellate jurisdiction shall be under such rules and regulations as may be provided by the Senate. including the time within which appeals shall be taken. A decision of the Senate affirming. modifying. or reversing a decision or judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States shall be final.\" After passage by the Congress both would require ratification as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of threefourths of the States. The massive invasion by the Supreme Court into the field of sociological experiment and its obvious naivete in decisions dealing with the dangers of communism require that Congress step into the breach before irreparable damage is done.

Internal Revenue Service. for the revision of the Federal firearms regulations. scheduled to be effective in the next few months. If the proposal. as it now stands. is Imposed on the firearms and ammunition dealers. it will work serious hardship. especially on the smaller dealers. One point in the proposal requires ammunition dealers to keep complete records on pistol and revolver shells. To maintain these records. it will necessitate additional help. time. and money for most dealers and manufacturers. Information which will be required for these records include: Name of manufacturer. type of shell. caliber and quantity. and. the identity of the person from whom the shell was received and the signature of the person to whom it was sold. This appears to me to be a regulation which is completely unnecessary. There are other points within these proposals which are causing considerable concern. not only by dealers. but by manufacturers of firearms and ammunition as well. In view of these and other facts. I have requested that these regulations not become effective until such time as Members of Congress have had ample time to study the revisions proposed and to be heard on them. It is my opinion that additional time is needed for further study by all concerned so that more favorable proposals can be worked out which will be acceptable to those affected. The Internal Revenue Service has announced that a public hearing will be held on the proposed revision of Federal firearms regulations on August 27. Since Congress probably will have adjourned by August 27. it will not be possible for the greater number of us to be present because of scheduled activities in our own district. therefore. it is my hope that the hearing may be postponed until early in 1958 at which time the Members of Congress who desire to be heard will have an opportunity to do so.

I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to provide a residence for the pages of the Senate and House of Representatives under the supervision of a Capitol Page Residence Board. This is the same bill as S. 973 which I introduced last year and was referred to the Committee on Rules.

On this date the identity of the Ukrainian peopleoppressed for centuriesemerged in Ukrainian independence. On this date the national will of the Ukrainian people for freedom and selfdetermination brought a new state into being. The independence gained was short lived. Freedom again was suppressed and stifled. The Ukrainian people once more were subjected to the iron hand of foreign rule. During these 38 years under Soviet domination. the will of the Ukrainian people for independence has continued to burn. Their determination to achieve freedom has not been suppressed by genocide. enforced starvation. or mass enslavement. While the Soviet Union enacts the lie of Ukrainian independence. while puppet officials cast a separate vote for the Ukraine in the United Nations. while Premier Khrushchev attempts to shift the responsibility for the past 38 years to Comrade Stalin. the deportations continue. the young manhood is inducted into Red armies. never to be permitted to return to the homeland. food grains are collected within the shadow of the treads of tanks. public assembly. public and private utterance. the press. the radio. the schools. all intellectual and cultural life conform to the rigid enforcements of state dictation.

The untimely death of C. Wayland Brooks came as a great shock to all of us who valued his friendship and who honored him as an outstanding soldier and statesman. A former Influential and highly esteemed Member of this body. Senator Brooks held a warm place in the hearts of a great host of friends. by whom he was affectionately known as \"Curly.\" His record of service in the Armed Forces was exceptional. He enlisted in the Marine Corps when the United States entered World War I. and before he end of the war he had been wounded seven times and had been decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross. the American Navy Cross. the Croix de Guerre. and the Purple Heart. For gallantry in action. he won a battlefield commission as second lieutenant and was advanced to first lieutenant in the front line. Senator Brooks was a vigorous and courageous fighter for the principles in which he believed. His dedication to the ideals of patriotic Americanism was honest and sincere. He battled constantly for a strong America. even though his convictions brought him into frequent conflict with proposals which he could not conscientiously support. The State of Illinois. which he represented so ably. and the Nation have lost a great leader in public service.

What is involved is much graver than that. I want to know how far we have already gone in deficit spending. and what other bills are to come before us to provide for lending money. We cannot consider the bill out of context and by itself. We have to decide what the overall situation will be next September. when and if Congress adjourns. If we are going to have a $15 billion deficit. we will have to take much more from the taxpayer and the worker than we are talking about giving him. For every dollar we give him we will have to take back $2. To me there are involved more than the bare provisions of the bill. I should like to ask the Secretary of the Treasury. \"Where do we now stand? How much less money have we taken in than was estimated by the President would be received? How much more money have we spent for military purposes than was recommended in the budget? How much have we expended by way of gifts and loans?\" Then I will be able to ask myself. \"How far can I go?\" The bill involves more than a 31/2percent interest rate and the raising of the sum to a billion dollars.

There is much more involved in the bill than is written into its provisions. as the Senator from Ohio so clearly and ably points out. We now must begin to relate these items to a consideration of our entire budget structure. and a possible inflationary gap. Passage of the bill could do far more damage to the taxpayers than the good it would do by providing assistance to municipalities to start a publicworks program de novo. which probably will not get under way for many months if it gets under way at all. The larger implications of the proposed legislation should be examined by the Senate. The Senator from Ohio is exactly correct. We must think of the bill in terms of other things we have done. We should think of it with relation to highways and with relation to burdens which may arise as a result of the passage of other bills. We should relate it to requirements of the housing bill and defense matters. to which the Senator has referred. I also can subscribe. to some extent. to the views of my friend. the Senator from New Jersey . in the statement that in some of the spending we are putting the emphasis on the wrong places. I should like to see an education bill reported. such a bill as the President has sent to Congress more than once. I believe we need more emphasis on education. We need more emphasis on education than on public works or on highways. I voted against the highway bill for that very reason. as a matter of protest.

I am glad we are not trying to give it permanent life at this time. because I believe Congress has grossly underestimated the giant task of extending proper financing to the smallbusiness community. We need more time to perfect permanent legislation. The capitalization of the Small Business Administration in the past has not been in sufficient amount. and it has not had adequate personnel with which to operate in a manner which would be of the greatest benefit to small business. I think the failuresand there have been many in the field of Small Business Administrationto meet the needs within a reasonable time limit within which the needed financing must be extended to small business. before rigor mortis sets in. have been partly due to the administration of the act. and that the primary responsibility rests upon it. At the time the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was killed deliberately by Congress. it had an adequate capitalization to make smallbusiness loans. The RFC had a fine record of successful operation in that field. The demise of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation greatly reduced. almost to an infinitesimal amount. the funds which had been available to the Small Business Administration for lending. The bill before the Senate today authorizes $75 million more In lending authority. I call attention to the fact that scarcely a day goes by on the stock market when more than $75 million in debentures are not floated by our great corporations. Yet this amount must serve for a year for all the smallbusiness community. We offer only this meager amount to an element of American business which cannot hope to find adequate financing in the regular financial channels. Mr. President. earlier I stated that the delay in approving loans is most disheartening to smallbusiness men. who find it necessary to go from office to office and to have their applications for loans considered and reconsidered. transferred to the Washington office. and finally transferred back to the regional office. and so forth. So. Mr. President. I hope a definite change will be made in respect to that situation. In the meantime. Mr. President. I join wholeheartedly in supporting the bill and urging its passage. It is an absolute necessity to act now so that at least some source of loans may be available.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to urge the Senate to take immediate action on S. 2504 to extend the Small Business Act of 1953. as amended. for 1 year. and to increase the agencys lending authority by $75 million. In my opinion. the record which has been established by the Small Business Administration since its inception in August 1953 Is more than sufficient justification for the passage of S. 2504. Since the Small Business Administration started actual operations in February 1954 it has approved 7.096 business loans in the total amount of $324.785.615. When the life of the agency expired at midnight on July 31. through failure of the Senate to act to extend it. 700 applications for business loans were pending. The aggregate amount of loans sought in these applications was $46 million. In a period of tight credit. such as the United States is undergoing at the present time. I consider it of utmost importance that small business in the Nation be able to receive the assistance of the Small Business Administration. Another phase of the agencys operations of which I most heartily approve is that of providing disaster loans to applicants from areas where disaster has struck. During the past 6 months approximately 120 counties in 20 States have been declared disaster areas. Applications for disaster loans totaling $2.034.000 were pending when the agency was forced to cease operations. From its beginning in 1953 through June 30. 1957. 6.149 disaster loans were made to businesses and homeowners who suffered damage as a result of hurricanes. tornadoes. or floods. These loans amounted to a total of $66.008.513. The Small Business Administration has been charged with the responsibility of issuing certificates of competency to small businesses. to make them eligible for certain Government contracts. When the agency was forced to stop operations. 8 applications were pending for certificates of competency. involving contracts of more than $250.000. Unless the certificates can be issued soon. these contracts will be lost by the smallbusiness concerns involved.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the authorization for the operation of the Small Business Administration expired at midnight on July 31. which means that all small business loans and disaster loans have come to an abrupt halt. I am pleased that the Senate has given unanimous consent to have this important proposed legislation considered. The bill now under consideration simply increases small business loan authorization by $75 million and extends the act to July 31. 1958. This increase in authorization will not completely solve the problem of tight money for the smallbusiness man. but it is a step in the right direction. I favor making this Agency permanent. however. the 1year extension provided in S. 2504 will restore life to the Small Business Administration and give us a chance to go into needed changes more thoroughly next session. Small businesses throughout the Nation are struggling to meet competition on a sound and profitable basis. and their need for guidance and loans provided through the Small Business Administration is more pressing today than ever before. I understand that there were over 700 loan applications pending before this Agency when the authorization expired Wednesday night. These loans are especially pressing in areas that have suffered recent disaster. Mr. President. as of June 30. 1957. 81 smallbusiness loans had been made in Mississippi. amounting to $4.765.000. These loans have greatly benefited the smallbusiness man and the local economy. They have been made on a sound basis and their repayment record has been outstanding. Small business loans do not compete with private banks. In fact. banks participate in more than twothirds of the small business loans made in the United States. There is growing demand for Government programs to be shifted to give greater assistance to small. independent concerns. The Small Business Administration is making great progress in filling a part of this gap. and is making a real contribution in giving needed assistance to small businesses throughout the Nation. I hope the bill will receive the full approval of the Senate as an expression of the general policy that the Agency should be continued on a sound business basis. because it is about the only agency that can fill the need when it cannot be taken care of solely by local and private financing. I appreciate the time yielded to me. and I yield back any time I may have remaining.",

It is very important that the Small Business Administration bill be passed. The Small Business Administration has now expired in accordance with the terms of the law. * I regret. Mr. President. that the extension provided is not for more than 1 year. because the Small Business Administration has much important work to do in the assistance of small business. by helping. advising and counseling those connected with the smaller concerns. Furthermore. upon the loan program of the Small Business Administration small business across the Nation has come to depend. The banks also have come to rely heavily upon the Small Business Administration and its loans. The loans which the banks make are loans which would otherwise be inadequate in amount to serve the needs of small business. although those banks desire to assist to the greatest possible extent. Furthermore. the Small Business Administration is needed not only for this year but for many years in the future. because the disasterloan program of the Small Business Administration is completely indispensable. We in Louisiana have had an illustration of the need of that program as a result of Hurricane Audrey. which struck Louisiana last year. In that hurricane there was damage of more than $100 million. Vast numbers of people lost their homes. Almost all the cattle in a very broad area were killed. Many people lost all their earthly belongings. as well as their loved and cherished ones.

But he has also been guilty of bad judgment. as he himself admits. and his lack of prudence in his dealings with Bernard Goldflne has cast a reflection not only on himself but on the President and the Republican administration of which he is a part. Mr. Adams made his first error of judgment when he permitted Mr. Goldfine to pay large hotel bills for him. Mr. Goldflne was an old and valued friend but he was also an industrialist who was in trouble with the Federal Government. Mr. Adams compounded this error when he failed to disclose all the details of this relationship until he appeared yesterday before a Congressional committee. a week after the original charges were aired. Those who defended Mr. Adams at first. find it more difficult to do so now. For It appears that he also received expensive gifts and that he made several direct inquiries to Federal commissions about matters in which Mr. Goldfine was involved. No one in his right mind would contend that Mr. Adams made these calls in return for favors received. he is not that kind of man. What bothers us is that he has apparently become infected with that peculiar moral blindness so common in Washington which sees nothing wrong in the acceptance of expensive hospitality or gifts as long as your own motives are pure. Mr. Adams did not tolerate this conduct on the part of officials of a previous administration and we are certain that he would not tolerate it on the part of his subordinates. He can hardly expect a less rigid code to be applied to himself. We shall be sorry to see Mr. Adams go. But he cannot stay on without further embarrassing the President whom he has been serving so devotedly and without clouding the standards which ought to govern high officials In their relationship with private individuals.",

First. what effect would his amendment have on the automobile dealers of the countrytaking into consideration the fact that many of them have on hand large stocks of automobiles. and also the fact that the industry is about to convert from 1958 models to the production of the 1959 models.",

When we consideras stated in the remarks I have made. and also as stated in the remarks my colleagues have madethe multiple taxes which today are placed on automobiles. we must realize that the removal of the excise tax on automobiles will immediately reduce the price to the consumer. I am convinced that there is a great pentup demand for new automobiles. Thus. the adoption and enactment of this amendment will result in a greater demand for automobiles. which. in turn. will result in the manufacture of larger numbers of automobiles. and that. in turn. will lead to the creation of more jobs. So the amendment will have a stimulating effect. not only in Michigan. but throughout the rest of the country. for we must realize that today the automobile industry is not confined to the State of Michigan. Instead. there are assembly plants in every section of the country. Besides that. there are the allied industries. such as the steel and the glass industries. which are affected by the wellbeing of the automobile industry. If we can get that industry moving ahead. I am sure it will provide the greatest shot in the arm to our economic growth when it is needed most.",

The excise tax was imposed really as a deterrent to sales. rather than as a means of securing revenue. That being the case. I say very frankly to my friend I think there is no more unfair tax than the present excise tax. There is no rhyme or reason to it. As I mentioned before in my remarks. the automobile excise tax is the only tax which was raised during the Korean war which has not been reduced. The taxes on perfumes. fur coats. diamond bracelets have been reduced. but not the automobile tax. I say it is grossly unfair.",

Whether one lives in the West. the North. the South. or the East. he pays a disproportionate share of the excise tax as compared with one who happens to live near the source of manufacture. If the Senator from Wyoming will bear with me. let me give him some material I have in my hand. Under the current tax law and Internal Revenue Service regulations. certain transportation costs are deemed to be manufacturing costs. for the purpose of computing excise tax. It is obvious. therefore. that consumers in different areas pay different amounts of excise tax. For example. purchasers of automobiles in the Miami area in 1957 paid approximately $300.000 more in excise taxes on automobiles than was paid by purchasers of a similar number of automobiles who lived near the Detroit area. Los Angeles purchasers paid approximately $31/A million more. Dallas purchasers paid approximately $225.000 more in excise taxes on automobiles. I think It is important to recognize that in addition to the discriminatory feature of excise taxes- on automobiles. residents of the South and West. for example. are subject to additional discriminations. Most certainly automobiles are not less of a necessity to persons in those areas. yet they are in fact penalized by accident of their residence.",

The transportation cost. on which the excise tax is determined. is based on the shipment of parts from Michigan to southern California. and not from southern California to Seattle.

This appropriation bill concerns the debt and any reductions that are made I would say are in the interest of the American taxpayer.

The Members heard from the folks back home. Everybody was offering amendments to cut the health and welfare appropriations. anxious to get on record so the folks back home would note their activity. interest. and efforts to effect economies end reduce the budget. There are some here today who are seldom around except when matters pertaining to foreign affairs are being considered. Then they suddenly become active and alerted to present you all of the definite information on all of these respective items. They do a good job and many succumb to their pronouncements. Some of us who are economy minded are seemingly unable to make much of an impression or inroad on any appropriation reductions on these bills that concern spending all over the world.

It is my expectation that during the course of these hearings the committee will hear testimony on this bill and other bills having a similar .purpose that are pending before the committee. Such public hearings and any executive sessions that may follow the conclusion of the public hearings will afford opportunity for a thorough consideration of the legislative proposals with respect to any need for providing such a supplementary benefit program and will afford opportunity for consideration of the best way to safeguard State unemployment compensation systems from Federal encroachment. My sponsorship of this legislation should not be construed to reflect prejudged support of the proposal in advance of its thorough study in public hearings. As I have indicated. my sponsorship of this legislation occurred by virtue of my position as ranking Republican member on the committee to which the legislation would be referred. Title II of the bill pertains to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and it may be appropriate that this subject should come within the cognizance of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the unemployment situation in the railroad industry has become truly alarming. In January 1958. average employment on class I railroads dropped to 886.000. the lowest for any month since the monthly employment reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission were started in 1920. In February. average employment dropped further by 24.000 to a total of 862.000. Capital expenditures of the railroads for this year are expected to be 38 percent below 1957. and this means still fewer rail jobs. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides that the maximum number of days of unemployment within a benefit yearfiscal year beginning July 1for which benefits may be paid to an employee shall be 130 days. However. the total amount of benefits which may be paid to such an employee within a benefit year may not exceed his compensation in the basecalendaryear. A record amount of more than $20 million in unemployment insurance benefits was paid out in January 1958 to 160.000 unemployed railroad workers according to the Railroad Retirement Board. Some 144.000 unemployed workers were on the insurance rolls during the week ending March 1. This decrease was due largely to the fact that almost 18.000 unemployed workers had already exhausted their rights to such benefits. It is anticipated by the Board that 49.000 unemployed workers will have exhausted their rights to benefits in the benefit year ending June 30. 1958. During the benefit year beginning July 1. 1958. some 65.000 unemployed railroad workers will exhaust their rights to unployment benefits. The Congress must do everything in its power to help these unfortunate railroad workers. and their families. I suggest. Mr. Speaker. that the least we can do is to provide additional unemployment insurance benefits to those who have already exhausted their rights to such benefits. I. therefore. propose. in a bill. H. R. 11620. which I introduced on March 25. to provide temporary unemployment insurance benefits to railroad workers for an additional 130 days for those who have already exhausted their benefit rights since July 1. 1957. and for those who will exhaust their benefit rights during the benefit year beginning July 1. 1958. My bill authorizes an appropriation of money in the Treasury to pay for those additional temporary benefits. including the administrative expenses resulting from the provisions of this act.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Presidents approval of the Cabinet cornmittees recommendation to reduce crude oil imports by approximately 58.000 barrels per day is a step in the right direction to strengthen our national security and to safeguard our domestic oil producing industry. However. because the proposed reduction continues to be predicated on a voluntary undertaking on the part of the importers I question the proposals long range effectiveness. I continue in my conviction that it is the responsibility of Congress to legislate on matters affecting the economic health of our domestic economy insofar as that economy is affected by imports. Such a matter of vital concern to every citizen of our Nation cannot be dealt with on a monthtomonth basis. We must exercise greater concern over the job opportunities of our own citizens rather than be preoccupied with providing job opportunities to foreign nationals at the expense of our own citizens. I repeat. I believe this action will be of some help to the domestic industry. but there is no enduring answer of action by Congress to safeguard not only our domestic oil industry but the other American industries that are threatened with destruction by unrestrained imports entering this Nation as the result of an inadequately considered tariff policy. The reduction of crude oil imports by approximately 58.000 barrels predicated on a voluntary undertaking on the part of the importers will be helpful to my oilproducing counties. I would much prefer it done by law enacted by Congress. Report to the Constituents of Fourth Congressional District by Hon. A. L.

In addition. I occasionally send out a questionnaire calling for the views of the people on various matters of pending legislation. I want the people of my District to be informed to the greatest possible degree of what is actually going on in the Nations Capitol. I receive thousands of letters from people of the District each year. Many of them contain valuable suggestions as to pending legislation. I have always encouraged the writing of letters by my constituents. The morning mail always brings suggestions. views. and ideas which are valuable to me as a Congressman. During the summer and fall. I spend most of my time traveling in the District. holding Government clinics on offelection years in each of the 38 county seat towns. Each fall I attend as many county fairs and fall festivals as possible in order to meet both city and country folk. When Congress is not in session I speak to as many service clubs. church groups. farm groups. and other organizations as is humanly possible.

I reported on this conversation. as follows: Nasser in his conversation with me indicated that both the problems of passage through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal for Israel ships and shipping intended for Israel could be handled peaceably. In the case of the Suez Canal. he reiterated that the matter might be settled in the World Court. I wish only to add. Mr. President. that I recall the conversation vividly.

I think todays events offer hope and encouragement for an amicable settlement of this important and irritating question. I add. Mr. President. as a final word. if the position of our Government is unequivocal. if it is made clear that we regard transit through the Suez Canal to be on the basis of no discrimination as to the origin of ships or the destination of cargo. if we hold firmly to the freedom of the seas and the rights to international waters. we shall be performing a distinct service for the peaceful and amicable settlement of some very vexing and trying problems.

It reminds me of the rumors revolving around the socalled Radford plan of a year or so ago. when it became common talk that the Defense Establishment was considering the possibility of a reduction in the Armed Forces of our country by approximately 800.000 men. That would have been a reduction from the forces in being at that time. I am wondering if the 100.000man reduction is not the prelude to a larger reduction in the weeks ahead. perhaps in the period after Congress adjourns. I note that. in the announced reduction. 15.000 men would be taken from the Marine Corps.

It is whether we are to stay within the realm of legal procedure by having cases filed by the chief legal officer of the Government. or whether by this amendment we are to say to the President. as the chief political officer. \"We will leave it to you to determine whether the legal rights of citizens of this country should be protected by legal processes before the courts.\" I am for part III of this bill. Mr. President. unchanged. for reasons I shall set forth in a major speech later this afternoon. or tonight. or in the wee hours of the morning. I shall give my reasons in my major speech. but for now. in this brief speech.

To me it appears totally inappropriate for us to try to \"pass the buck\" to the President of the United States in a matter of this kind. I share the views of the Senator from Oregon that what we have before us is a legal question. so far as the law is concerned. and is not a matter to be possibly handled one way by one President and another way by another President in the future. I am apprehensive concerning such a possibility. Furthermore. I cannot see how putting the responsibility on the President meets the main objection I have to part III. As I stated yesterday. my objection to part III is not based upon the question of the man who administers it. It is based upon the substance of the proposal itself. I object definitely to the incorporation by reference of the postCivil War legislation passed during the unfortunate Reconstruction era. I shall continue in that opposition. I think it would be totally wrong to go back to Reconstructionday legislation in this bill. So. from that angle. it is difficult for me to see how substituting the President for the Attorney General would meet the objections which I have to part In itself. I feel strongly that we should go to the heart of this issue. and deal with the right to vote as the essence of what we are trying to do. I am hopeful that we can reach an agreement on that issue. I do not feel that I can support the suggestion that we make part III more palatable by injecting the President of the United States into it. Again. let me say that I have the greatest respect for the political and legal acumen of the distinguished Senator from Ohio . my very good friend. I think he has done what he has done in the spirit of trying to reach a satisfactory adjustment. but I cannot agree with his approach to the situation.",

The act was for the purpose of helping people build plants. when they were going to engage in purely defense projects. such as the addition of a wing to a plant in my home town. For instance. I think several divisions of the Boeing Aircraft Co. received a tax writeoff because they are working on items for the defense budget. In this case. there may be a defense plant somewhere in the area. but I do not know of it. and I know the area rather well. I do not think the power from the Idaho Power Co. project would serve. even in the second degree. a defense plant. The power will go Into the Bonneville pool. if we can prevail upon the authorities to permit that to be done. and the Bonneville pool serves several defense plants. But the pool is private. I think Senators will agree with me about that. There is a great deal of talk about the three dams the Idaho Power Co. will build. However. the company has not even made an attempt to build the third dam. which would make possible the generation of more kilowatts than would be generated at the two other dams. From what I have read and heard to date about the increase in interest rates. I doubt very much that the Idaho Power Co. could afford to build the third dam. because the cost of the power from the dam would be too great. unless the company could obtain another $339 million tax writeoff. In this case there are not sufficient defense elements to justify the expressed intent of the company. On the other hand. in many other cases sufficient defense elements do exist. For instance. in my State there is a foundry which makes logging equipment. It began to manufacture shell cases in its foundry. and for that purpose it made an addition to the plant. and it applied for a tax writeoff in that connection.

The question Is whether we wish to use it to its fullest ultimate capacity. or whether we wish to foreclose the development of the full potential use of this great site in this great reach of the river. by building two small dams which. although they will produce some kilowatts of power. will not produce all the other benefits. The issue is as simple as that. Added to itlet me say that I am not always correct. but in this case I have been correct and I am correctis the fact that last year I stated on this floor. in addressing the Senators on the other side of the aisle. that if they would watch. they would see that the minute the Idaho Power Co. was allowed to proceed. it would get a tax writeoff. That statement is to be found in the RECORD. And that has happened. So I have stated the issue. It is true that the small dams the Idaho Power Co. wishes to build would produce a certain amount of electrical power. a certain number of kilowatts. and they would be fine kilowatts. because those dams would skim off the cream. but they would not result in any flood control. Furthermore. we would lose water storage. which is the most important thing in the Pacific Northwest. Even now we are having a tough time with Canada. and the question is whether Canada will permit us to use the upper reaches of the Columbia River. So perhaps we need the Hells Canyon Dam now more than ever.

I wish to say I think it is very well that the list of the utilities has been placed in the RECORD showing the companies that have had the privilege of tax writeoffs.

In view of the fact that at the end of th fiscal year the Commodity Credit Corporation will either by indebted for commodity purchases or will have loans to the extent of $7.500.000.000. certainly it would not seem wise for the Government to buy for this purpose a commodity which was not in surplus supply. inasmuch as there are surplus feed grains which already belong to the Governments account.",

So it becomes a dual feeding process. Ranchers are probably better qualified to discuss this subject than I. but we all know it is true. Secondly. it seems to me while we are talking about the amendment for the RECORD. I should mention that one of the most serious faults in the administration of the law is that there is not a uniform method of administration throughout the States. For example. one State may have very stringent rules for the administration of the law. Some States and some counties have even gone so far as to require financial statements from the persons who receive assistance under the drought program. The practical effect is that a premium may be imposed on some people who have put forth the same effort. There are situations of which I am aware in which a man on one side of the road could obtain assistance because he had used his bounty of the last few years. while the man across the road could not because he had a little credit left at the bank.",

It is indeed appropriate. in my opinion. that this should be the first action of our committee because it deals entirely and exclusively with serviceconnected compensation. The bill before us today provides. generally. a 10percent increase In the basic rate of compensation for our veterans who have received disabilities in the service of our country. The only higher rate is the one applicable for those who have become totally disabled. and in line with the findings of the Presidents Commission. the socalled Bradley Commission. we have increased this group to $225 monthly. or a 24percent increase over the existing rate. It is encouraging to know that this bill is supported by all our veterans organizations. and in view of the action of the House in the 84th Congress in approving this legislation unanimously on a record vote.

I commend the distinguished chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee for the leadership which he has given in both the 84th and 85th Congresses in the consideration of legislation to provide increases in serviceconnected disability compensation and in increasing dependency allowances for dependents of serviceconnected disabled veterans. I strongly urge the passage of H. R. 52 which we now have before us. An identical act was passed by the House on July 12. 1956. under the designation H. R. 12038. Unfortunately. the other body did not act upon H. R. 12038 during the 84th Congress. H. R. 52 deals entirely and exclusively with the subject of compensation for serviceconnected disabled veterans. Generally. it increases all rates of compensation below 100 percent by 10 percent. rounded to the nearest dollar. The increase for those totally disabled amounts to a 24 percent increase. The need for a revision and increase of compensation rates for these partially and totally disabled veterans and their dependents is indicated by the commonly recognized increase in cost of living. The modest increases provided in H. R. 52 will not. in my opinion. be commensurate with the accelerated expenses of existence which confront our disabled veterans. but at least it will show to them that the people of this Nation are still aware of the great sacrifice which these disabled men made for their country in time of international crisis. I want to impress upon the Members of the House that this bill is a very conservative piece of legislation. It has been thoroughly considered by our Veterans Affairs Committee. It is worthy of the support of every Member of this body.",

Mr. COAD disagreed with the Secretarys request for greater discretion in fixing price supports than is presently provided by law. Mr. Speaker. when a Secretary of Agriculture. who incidentally has been a farmer most of his life. calls some 25 years and nearly $12 billion worth of Federal farm programs a flop. I believe it is time for the Congress to sit up and listen. Mr. Benson said. in effect. that these vast expenditures have made \"little or no contribution to the problem of the lowincome farmers\" and he served notice that unless Congress begins to take a more realistic attitude toward agriculture. the problems will get bigger rather than smaller. Although his views on farm policies are considerably misguided. I am nonetheless happy to see that the gentleman from Iowa is finally waking up to the fact that something must be done for the farmers. He offers no solution other than firing Secretary Benson. If Mr. COAD had awakened early in this session to the farm problem. perhaps he would not have opposed. and helped to defeat the Republican sponsored emergency corn legislation which was designed to assist the farmers in the corn producing areas of his district. That legislation would have increased corn acreages this year from 37.3 million acres to 51 million acres and enabled corn farmers to place acreages equal to 15 percent of their allotment in the soil bank. In my judgment. the gentleman voted against the best interests of his farmers by supporting the socalled Cooley bill. A bill which would have opened the soil bank to growers of basic crops as well as feed grains. cost $1 billion a year and would have destroyed the soilbank program. He knew that President Eisenhower would veto the Cooley bill even if the Congress passed it. In short. the gentleman from Iowa talks a lot about helping the farmers of his district but votes against them.",

Before the bench that day were two cases. that of John Henry Harmon and Howard Abramowitz. both men who had performed their military duties in an exemplary manner. and whose records were without blemish. Both had been summarily discharged as undesirable despite their honorable service records solely on the basis of their activities as civilians. before their military service began. Harmon and Abramowitz appealed their cases up through the machinery for redress that the Military Establishment provides. and were at each step denied any change in the character of their discharges. Not until Harmon took his case to the Federal court did the Army reconsider its positionthen upgrading his discharge to generalstill a less than honorable discharge. On Wednesday. after living for years with the social stigma and deprivation of legal rights attached to a less than honorable discharge. both men had reached the highest and the final seat of justice. And there. before the Supreme Court of the United States. counsel for the defendant. Secretary of the Army Brucker. admitted that the Justice Department had advised the Army that it had no authority to issue a discharge based on civilian conducta statement that was in fact a confession of error. My colleagues. this body passed a bill. H. R. 8772 now pending before the Sanate Armed Services Committee. in the last session which would provide machinery for exservicemen who had been tendered a less than honorable discharge to redeem themselves by allowing them to petition for a new type of general discharge after 3 years of commendable postservice civilian conduct. During the short debate on the bill. a number of its supporters are on record as saying that the bill did not go far enough. Clearly. it did not. In fact. it may seem that in a backhanded manner. the House of Representatives has almost endorsed the very thing which the Justice Department has advised is unauthorized. and by implication. unconstitutional. I sincerely hope that the other body will either reject or strongly revise the bill before it. and that the Members of the House will have a further opportunity to participate in the writing of equitable legislation.",

The Ukrainian National Republic became one of the first victims of Communist expansion and aggression when its sovereignty and independence were brutally crushed in 1920. In spite of the long years -of enslavement. however. the people of Ukraine have preserved their strong national feelings. and their resistance to communism and of the bloody persecution which they have suffered at the hands of Communist Russia speak for themselves. In our age of tremendous technological and scientific innovations. our ultimate weapon in the struggle with communism is man. We must not become blind to this basic truth. The human desire for freedom is more potent and more explosive than any scientific weapon. It will survive any hardship. and it will outlast the effect of any weapon of destruction. We must remember this as we pay tribute to the brave people of Ukraine who have amply demonstrated their undaunted determination to regain independent national status. We must encourage the spirit of freedom which flames in their hearts by pledging ourselves anew to the task of building a better world in which all nations may live in peace. freedom. and justice.

Egypts seizure of the Suez Canal. confiscations of foreign properties by the Argentine Government. the failure of Indonesia to honor her contractual obligations with the Netherlands. and others. In the face of this growing and serious problem.

He pointed to the only constructive and practical solution to this vexing problem in the proposal which was first presented to the recent International Industrial Development Conference in San Franciscoa world Magna Carta or international investment treaty which is the brain child of Mr. Hermann J. Abs. director of the Deutsche Bank and Credit Institute for Reconstruction. Frankfurt. Mr. Abs Magna Carta was reported by the press as \"the first concrete proposal\" to come out of the San Francisco conference. The Congressman strongly urged acceptance of the Magna Carta principle. Signator nations. he explained. would be bound by the terms of the Magna Carta from arbitrarily seizing private investments. since credit and other sanctions would be invoked against the aggressor nation. The international convention code would be reenforced by an International Court of Arbitration which would establish effective and enforceable rules of law for the securing of private foreign investments. The Magna Carta. the Congressman asserted. would be a great step forward in the development of world trade and in the protection of those countries that are interested in peace.",

I should like to point out that there was not much stress placed on the riparian rights of Ethiopia and the Sudan in January 1956. when Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover. Jr.. came before the Foreign Relations Committee and in effect told us that it was the position of the administration that this Government would give $56 million to the Government of Egypt. and that the British would contribute another $14 million. all on a grant basis. making a total of $70 million to be given to the Egyptian Government by the two Western nations in order that the Aswan Dam could be started. The distinguished minority leader will recall that at that meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee Mr. Hoover did not meet with a very warm reception. because it was to be grant aid. because. as the minority leader has pointed out. there were those of us who were interested in building multipurpose projects in our own country. and we could not even get a loan from our own Government for such projects. and because there were other factors involved. such as the attitude of the Committee on Appropriations. and the statement issued by it. which indicated there was a possibility of friction in view of the development of new cotton and rice areas if the Aswan Dam were built. However. I do not recall anything being said in January 1956. by Under Secretary Hoover concerning the riparian rights of Sudan and Ethiopia. Does the Senator recall any?",

I attend bipartisan meetings and discussions of our foreign policy. I am quite clear in my mind. however. that at one of the meetings I attended the question of riparian rights was raised. because at one of them I recall there was reference to the grave problems involved. because as the distinguished Senator knows. even in our own country. among States in a common Union. difficulties arise in bringing about interstate compacts when honest differences of opinion exist. States which have such close economic ties and such friendly relationships as Arizona and Nevada and California have had very honest differences of opinion. That situation has prevailed in the case of other States as well. I recall that the question was raised. because it was pointed out that if in a nation such as ours. with a common language and a common heritage. there arose controversies which sometimes extended over many years. how much more difficult would it be to handle riparian probems which involved several foreign countries.",

I agree that. whether or not he had received funds from the Western governments for the building of the Aswan Dam. it was his intention to go ahead with the expropriation of the company and the Suez Canal anyway. From the Aswan Dam withdrawal. however. there did come a series of events which resulted finally in the invasion of Egypt by Israel. France. and England. and from it came the Eisenhower doctrine. The Eisenhower doctrine now is faced with a situation in regard to Syria. which I believe is fraught. with great danger. If the distinguished minority leader will indulge me further.

If any untoward developments occur in the Middle East. it will be quite important that we have a mobile. ready striking force attached to the 6th Fleet.

Then he added to it $45.773.000. which all of us appreciated very much. and for which all of us were very glad. Then he added to it $25 million for small projects. So the total of the Presidents program amounted to approximately $230 million. The resolution as reported would increase it to $330 million. It covers some additional programs. For instance. for the upper Colorado storage project. there is an additional amount for the Glen Canyon Dam. which is progressing very well. and there is an additional amount for the Flaming Gorge Dam. which is far ahead of the preliminary schedule. and there have also been included other items of that nature. in cases in which we think the economy could be quickly stimulated by work of this type.",

The producers feel this futures trading is making the price of onions too high when there are few onions and too low when there are plenty of onions. There were considerable hearings in the Committee on Agriculture on this. Apparently all of the people who are producing onions want to stop the trading. and all of the people who are trading in onions. of course. wanted to continue trading.",

The question I understand that we have before us immediately is whether or not we will adopt this rule providing for the consideration of this bill. Mr. Speaker. the House today has the opportunity to redeem a campaign pledge made by both political parties in their 1956 platforms. You will recall that in 1956 the Senate passed an area redevelopment bill. and the House Banking and Currency Committee reported a similar bill favorably to the House. but the House failed to act on it before adjournment. At that time. about 19 major labor areas and 65 smaller areas were classified by the Department of Labor as having areas of substantial labor surplus. Today 89 major labor areas and 182 smaller areas are so classified. About 70 of these areas. in 20 States. would qualify now for assistance under this bill. These are the hardcore depressed areas. whose people have been fighting depression for years. 10 of the major areas have had unemployment of 6 percent or more ever since 19517 long. weary years ago. For them. help is long past due. For years. too. we have been studying the problems of lowincome farm families. concentrated largely in the Southeast. but covering 16 States in all. For these people. too. the time has come for action. And it is not just their problem. as the President has said: The fate of distressed communities is a matter of national as well as local concern.",

I think the first that I knew about it. at least. was last November. when we all admit it looked like we might go into some kind of a tailspin. Now I findand I believe all will agreethat business conditions have picked up considerably. While 8 or 10 months ago we thought probably we would be in particularly bad shape. I think we will all agree that we are much pleased with the recent happenings in regard to the recession. The administration several months ago presented a bill which provided $50 million in loans and $1.5 million in assistance grants. making a total of $51.5 million for loans and assistance. Then the Committee on Banking and Currency brought forth their version. Instead of the amount being $51.5 million. they raised it to $200 million in loans and $79.5 million in grants. In other words. now that there has beeii considerable improvement. so far as the recession is concerned. the Committee on Banking and Currency has jumped the amount in the bill by about 400 percent or $228 million. Mr. Speaker. I think this bill is economically unsound. It grants to localities with no provision being made for local contributions $791/2 million. Any time you find the Federal Government pouring. $791V2 million into local communities. without any local contribution or local responsibility. you know there is going to be plenty of money wasted.",

One is by loans. Of course. local participation is required. not only local participation by State and county agencies. but also by individuals. We must not expect too much of the local resources. because in many cases the communities that have suffered from this condition over the years are literally unable to put up all the necessary funds. so the States should participate in their behalf. There should be no rigid requirement that every locality participating in the benefits should participate in the financing. because if we really deal with the problem we have to recognize that they are not prospering financially. The second way it helps rural areas is by technical assistance. I would be among the last ever to set one interest against another. to say that we should not help foreign countries. but it is.

This is a bill to meet the problem of those who need help in raising families. those who want the chance to build good lives. This is a bill to relieve chronic unemployment and underemployment due in part to the largesse of Congress in developing the natural resources of other areas of the United States. to which areas many of our industries migrated to take advantage of the favorable industrial climate made possible by the allocation in their areas of Federal tax moneys. In March of 1957 I introduced a somewhat similar bill. H. R. 5566. A long period of time elapsed. during which time we were unable to secure any favorable action by the House Committee on Banking and Currency. and a subsequent period of time elapsed in which we were unable to secure action by my own Committee on Rules.

I am unable to understand the attitude taken by those representing States where the great agricultural interests exist on this proposed legislation to create programs to assist distressed areas in the Nation. particularly the coal areas which have been hit hard in the last several years. This legislation has been referred to as somewhat confused. We had an agricultural bill which came up here the other day. and let me say there was about as much confusion in it as any legislation that has come before the House for some time. It was so confused it was recommitted. However. within several days it was brought right out again because the agricultural interests are determined to be protected. and do not forget that. But when a coal mine in the western part of my State of Pennsylvania folds up after 40 or more years of operation there are 300 or 400 men thrown out of employment with no place to go. no work available. no opportunities available. nobody seems to be particularly concerned about a situation of that kind. These folks. these areas. are in distressing circumstances. their homes and families to be cared for. and yet it is difficult to arouse interest to bring about programs to afford these folks relief. But let us assume that such a situation arose in a farm State in an area where 400 or 500 farmers because of drought. flood. or some other circumstances found themselves in desperate need. rest assured programs and plans would be developed and legislation enacted to afford relief for those conditions that occurred in that particular area. What should be the difference in helping farm areas or coal mining areas? They are all our people. The coal industry today is making the fight of its life for its very existence. so when legislation is presented to afford relief from these conditions that exist in these distressed areas throughout the Nation. it should be given every consideration. Now a word about mutual security and our worldwide programs to help people in distress all over the world. nobody is too concerned about the approximate $4 billion appropriation for foreign aid set up for the coming year.",

As yet. far too little is known of the immediate. as well as the ultimate. effects which radiation may have. While we are thinking about sustaining or reducing the budget. we should also be thinking in terms of whether or not humanity will be obliterated. That can be done if we cut the budget to a point where the Kremlin thinks it then is time to attack us. According to information submitted by the Army. the third world war will bring about the loss of 70 million American lives. So great are the dangers of radioactive fallout that I believe we must stimulate authoritative research into this field. As we recall. in 1955 the United Nations created a Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. This Committee met for the first time in Geneva in April 1957. and discussed the genetic effects of radiation and measurements of radioactive fallout. particulaxly of strontium 90. Although the committee has not yet conducted any extensive research. it is agreed that radiation is harmful to humans. The f allout danger is especially high in countries like the United States. the United Kingdom. and Sweden. where the population has already been subjected to a considerable amount of radiation through medical practices. As we know. hearings are scheduled by a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. to begin May 27 and to extend through June 7. The hearings are expected to cover the fallout cycle from its inception in the detonation of nuclear weapons. through its dissemination in the atmosphere and descent to the earth. and finally to its uptake and effects on human beings. animals. and vegetation. In this highly technical field. of course. we must rely heavily upon the findings of our scientists. However. we must also attempt to correlate their conclusions and then formulate protective programs and policies in the Interests of our people. The Sunday Star published an informative article entitled \"The Debate of the Scientists.\" on the pros and consin lay languageof this vital issue.

The award to the Senator from Massachusetts was recognition of the excellence of his book Profiles in Courage. published by Harpers & Bros.. which tells the story of political independence and courage of great American political leaders. The Pulitzer awards were started in 1917 under the will of the late Joseph Pulitzer. publisher of the New York World. They are made by the trustees of Columbia University. acting on the recommendations of an advisory board. The Pulitzer awards in the fields of letters and music are the outstanding awards to American authors for their cultural achievements.

    "speech": "Mr. President. there are several items which I wish to discuss during the morning hour. This mornings press reports the Secretary of the Treasury. George Humphrey. as saying that the fast tax writeoff program \"adds to inflation. gives favored companies an unfair advantage over competitors. and by holding back revenue postpones the day of tax reduction.\" I shall ask to have certain material printed in the RECORD. Before doing so. let me say that I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury that accelerated tax amortization certificates give f avored companies unfair advantages over competitors. However. I regret that his own personal financial records do not seem to bear out his advice to the committee. Thanks to the senior Senator from West Virginia and his initiative. I can now present to the Senate information of unusual interest in connection with tax amortization and Mr. Humphrey. The Senator from West Virginia asked the Office of Defense Mobilization to list the rapid tax writeoff certificates granted to companies with which the Secretarys M. A. Hanna Co. is associated directly or by interlocking directorates. The period listed is from the start of the program through April 11. 1957. Mr. Humphrey was a member of the ODM board 4 of these years. This list shows that 410 certificates totaling $1.021.813.000 were granted these companies. As the Senate will recall. Secretary Humphrey told the Finance Committee: My securities. which I expect to retain. consist now and have always consisted almost entirely of common stocks of four companies with whose management I was associated. These are the M. A. Hanna Co.. Hanna Coal & Iron Corp.. National Steel Corp.. and Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Co. * * * The M. A. Hanna Co.. in turn. owns substantial stock interests in National Steel. Pittsburgh Consolidation. Industrial Rayon Corp.. Standard Oil of New Jersey. Phelps Dodge Corp.. Seaboard Oil Co.. Iron Ore Company of Canada. Durez Plastics & Chemicals. Inc.. Hanna Coal & Ore Corp.. and smaller interests in a few other companies. A list of all the companies associated with M. A. Hanna interests has been compiled by the Library of Congress for the Senator from West Virginia. and I now present it for the RECORD.",

America was all the world we could see. and it was easy to forget the rest of the earth in such a huge country. Now the world is suddenly much smaller. and Americans are beginning to see that people in Africa. Asia. South America. and Europe have become our neighbors. This is a big surprise to most Americans. and it has not been easy for us to remember how many new neighbors modern technical advances have given us. What shall we do about these new neighbors if they need help? The easiest thing would be to say. \"They are still thousands of miles away. Lets continue to forget their existence.\" But then someone tells us that one of our distant neighbors is in bad trouble of one sort or another. We might be able to help them if we wanted to make the effort. We cannot be comfortable and enjoy our lives with a good conscience. no matter how hard we try to justify ourselves. In the back of most American minds is the unpleasant half thought that we are not doing right to live in ease when somebody else is in terrible trouble. The only thing we can do to get rid of this uncomfortable feeling is to help as best we can. It Is extremely hard for a proud person or nation to bear being helped. We would all prefer to stand on our own feet and never need help. Unconsciously. every human being resents the necessity for being helped and takes out this resentment on the person or group who is there to do the helping. This Is not a beautiful trait of human character but it is wellnigh universal. I regret to say that I believe if Vietnamese were in the United States to help Americans in some dire extremity. we should probably begin to dislike our helpful rescuers very soon. We should all be ashamed of ourselves for this. It is a bad kind of pride that nearly all human beings have.",

I should like to comment on those parts of an editorial which appeared in the Minneapolis Star. of March 5. 1958. which I think are vital to an understanding of the farmers dilemma today. The remarks from an address I delivered in Austin. Minn.. to the MinnesotaIowa Swine Institute. are pertinent. I believe. to the excellent questions raised in the editorial. At Austin. I observed that it was ironic today that achievement in production has worked against our farmers. The farmer of today has advanced faster in the expansion of production than has any other phase of our national economy. Industry has increased its production by about 3.2 percent a year during the past 10 years. Agriculture has advanced 6 percent a year. In terms of total productive output. agricultural production is 60 percent higher than it was 10 years ago. Even though the farmer may agree to curtailment of his production at present. there remains the problem of surplus products. At Austin. I again stressed the need for new frontiers in research to find uses for surplus products. The Congress must enact legislation to establish a sweeping program of research into industrial uses of agricultural products. We have research facilities. both private and public. that can go into the problems of finding new uses for our present surpluses. I have cosponsored a bill to accomplish exactly that result. We have landgrant colleges. universities. and the extension services. which are willing and capable to investigate and to look into the new frontiers of agricultural research. My purpose in inviting attention to the excellent editorial in the Minneapolis Star is to bring again to the attention of Members of Congress the research facilities which I think can do much to reduce present surplus products and solve the growing problem of the farmers productive capacity.

The survey showed that there are no less than 15 different institutions in that one city offering approximately 3.000 courses for adults. There are about 58.000 registrations in these courses. A new Milwaukee Council of Adult Learning has just been formed for the purpose of helping to coordinate these courses. In other communities of my State there is likewise tremendous interest in increased adult education. For example. I note in Lake Geneva in my State the efforts of the Adult Education Council. composed of 15 member organizations. to expand its work. Included among such member organizations are. of course. the school system. the public library. YMCA. PTAs womens clubs. ministerial groups. the American Red Cross and others. To me. Mr. President. the growth of adult education in our land represents one of the finest trends in our times. It demonstrates that more and more Americans realize that education should never really stop. The fact that a man or a woman years ago secured or did not secure a bachelors or other degree. should not mean that the growth of the mind should cease. For both vocational and avocational purposes. adult education can make an everincreasing contribution to the wellbeing of the American people. As Americans acquire new skills. new interests. new hobbies. they are in an ever better position to serve themselves and to be better citizens of their country.

The wages earned in the foreign countries go all the way from 11. 12. or 15 cents an hour in Japan to 45. 50. or 60 cents an hour in Western Europe and the United Kingdom. We have already reduced the tariffs on textiles and other commodities an average of 80 percent. We are getting ready to authorize a further reduction of 15. 20. or 35 percent of that which now remains. How can American industry survive against that kind of competition. when there is no protection from the Tariff Commission or the President? What the distinguished Senators seek to strike from the bill is simply an amendment adopted by the Finance Committee which provides that when the Tariff Commission make a recommendation for relief from proved injury the President shall implement that recommendation unless he comes to the Congress and asks the Congress to agree with him in ignoring or overruling the Tariff Commissions recommendation. Then. if Congress approves such action. the President can take it. Is that un. reasonable? All in the world that would do. Mr. President. would be to say that the industries in our States would have their fates determined by the Congress instead of some anonymous official. Are Senators satisfied with the operation of the program with reference to industries in their States?

I was told by one of my distinguished friends that not many votes are changed by any discussions which take place. However. I did not want any Senator to vote one way or another on the pending amendment on the basis of a legal opinion submitted to the President by the Attorney General. and which was then submitted by the President to Congress. I shall discuss briefly this odd legal opinion which was recently submitted to the President over the signature of the Attorney General of the United States. and which the President then forwarded to Congress. This strange opinion holds that section 6 (c) of the bill. which was proposed by the junior Senator from South Carolina and the senior Senator from Oklahoma . and then approved by the Committee on Finance. is unconstitutional. The Thurmond amendment merely provides that findings of the Tariff Commission. if disapproved by the President. shall nevertheless become effective if approved by a concurrent resolution of Congress. Lawyers in this body may well wonder why I take the time to challenge a constitutional argument so obviously unsound. However. this piece of legal advice to the President is only one of the most recent in a long line of poor opinions. Most of this bad advice has been presented to the President over the signature of the Attorney General. The President. not being a lawyer. can hardly be criticized for submitting without modification to the Congress the opinions of his chief legal officer on pending legislation. Both the present Attorney General and his predecessor in office are able lawyers. I am sure they have not written. and in many cases have not even studied. the fallacious constitutional arguments of which they are the ostensible authors. They must be held responsible. nevertheless. for the unhealthy practice of failing to differentiate between legislative proposals which the President considers unwise and measures which are constitutionally objectionable. Mr. President. a foolish law is not necessarily an unconstitutional law. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the RECORD the letter and opinion of the Attorney General on section 6 (c) of the pending bill.",

It is still apparent. however. that it was necessary to rush through a supplemental of $1.3 billion in January in order that the Defense Department might have additional funds. If the appropriation process is perfect as it operates today. there is no need for H. R. 8002 or the Wigglesworth amendment. If interest in economy is dead in the Congress. as many cynics find it fashionable to say this year. this bill has not a chance of passage. Last years budget request for $71.8 billion shocked the voters. They will be even more alarmed when they find out that we will spend vastly more before this fiscal year is over. as a result of authorizations and appropriations passed in previous years. There has not been as much economy mail this year. Is it because of the sputnik or is it because our taxpayers are frustrated. disillusioned. and cynical as they watched Congress cut almost $5 billion from total appropriations requested for fiscal 1958 to no avail? I voted for many of these cuts in nondefense expenditures. In fact. for some $3 billion more than the House sustained. Yet. we find that more than the budget total of $72 billion will be spent by the executive department this year. If this is Congressional control over Federal spending. if this satisfied you and your constituents. vote against this bill. This bill that comes before you is the considered judgment and the carefully developed recommendation of a committee of this Housethe Committee on Government Operationswhich voted unanimously to report it. Hearings have been held. The bill has been deliberated in subcommittee. debated in full committee. and the Wigglesworth amendment was submitted this morning to the whole committee for consideration as a substitute. Again. I assure you that the Wigglesworth amendment carries out the fundamental principles of H. R. 8002. It has been drawn to overcome the objections of defense contractors and of some of the distinguished gentlemen of the House Committee on Appropriations. It is a carefully written attempt to perfect the legislative principles of H. R. 8002 and to meet objections raised in good faith.",

May I quote from the report on this bill which was issued by the Committee on Appro.priations in the name of the gentleman from Texas . He makes a point which I think is one of the most effective arguments you could possibly summon for the passage of this bill. May I quote: It is true that large unexpended balances are in the hands of the Department each year and that in the annual appropriation bills the Congress does not now exercise direct annual control over their annual rate of disbursement. I urge the membership to support this bill tomorrow. I hope this is only the start of Hoover Commission recommendations which will be brought to the floor for passage during this session. A year ago this week I introduced H. R. 5792. to create a Supply and Service Administration in the Department of Defense. H. R. 5808. to establish a Federal policy concerning the termination. limitation. or establishment of businesstype operations of the Government which may be conducted in competition with private enterprise. and H.

It has been argued that this measure would hamstring and interfere with the work of the Committee on Appropriations. But you cannot get that meaning out of language which is permissive and discretionary. as is the case with the language I have just read. It may be pointed out that in section B (b) of the Wigglesworth amendment the President in sending up his budget. where he is satisfied that an accrual accounting system is satisfactory. is required to make a proposed limitation on annual accrued expenditures. But that does not become law. It will not become law until the Appropriations Committee itself and the Congress. upon the recommendation of the Appropriations Committee. impose a limitation upon annual accrued expenditures.",

Much of the concern centers around reports of injuries as a result of homemade rockets. I have been concerned with this particular problem ever since last fall. when first reports began to come to my attention about the damage involved to our young people. On February 17. I released to the public a proposal that the Department of Defense establish a fullscale highschool rocket program.- I anticipated that there would be two phases to this program: First. science seminars to be conducted by military personnel and military facilities and. second. supervision of actual rocket launchings. The purpose of such a program would be. as I see it. to (1) stimulate interest in science. (2) make accessible guidance and facilities to the high schools. (3) provide proper safety measures for rocket experimentation. and (4) recruit into the Armed Forces rocketmissile programs. It is my thinking that science seminars conducted by military personnel should be held in population centers and that they would be attended by high school science students and faculty members. Military facilities and supervision would be available for demonstrations and launchings. This whole program would be on a voluntary basis but the students and faculty would know that if it were desired. the Department of Defense would be prepared to cooperate in this program. I do not believe that the safety problem involved in recent rocket activity by teenagers can be overstressed. The Department of Defense has already taken certain steps to deal with this problem. but I do believe that more can be done and that every effort should be made by the Government to assist our students in every way. I call this to your attention with the hope that through the Office of Special Assistance to the President for Science and Technology. a governmentwide program can be developed which will at the same time inspire a continued interest in science and rocketry and provide an adequate safety factor for young people who are engaged in such activity.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on behalf of my colleague. the senior Senator from New York [Mr. IvFsl. and myself. I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to increase from 18 to 21 yearsin the case of children who are attending schoolthe maximum age for receiving benefits under title II of the Social Security Act. I wish to make a brief statement relating to the bill. The present law works a severe hardship on widowed mothers trying to provide a college education for their children by cutting off social security benefits when the dependent child reaches 18. However. if the law is amended as proposed. then some 110.000 young Americans now 18 through 20 years of age would receive an average payment of $50 a month until their 21st birthday. so long as they remain in school. Such an extension of social security coverage will cost approximately $65 million a yearor only about 1 percent of our total social security payments annually. Some of the groundwork for extending coverage in this manner was laid last year when Congress enacted Public Law 880. which provided that both the widowed mother and her dependent child who was disabled would continue to receive benefits if the childs disability occurred before age 18. Similar coverage to include mothers in the bill I am introducing would cost approximately $30 million a year. Today. when the cost of a college education is soaringwhen educators estimate that at least 100.000 gifted highschool students cannot afford to go to collegethis bill would allow the dependent child an average of $600 a year to help defray expenses. It seems to me that at a time when our country must develop the mental as well as the physical manpower to maintain its position at home and abroad in the decades of decision ahead. we must do everything in our power to encourage as many of our youth as possible to complete their education.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. at the request of the commercial fishing industry and individuals directly concerned with incidents which have caused losses and injuries to United States citizens while engaged in fishing on the high seas. I am introducing. for appropriate reference. three bills. one to amend Public Law 680. 83d Congress. the act of August 27. 1954 (68 Stat. 833). to protect the rights of vessels and citizens of the United States on the high seas and in territorial waters of foreign countries. That act. passed during the 83d Congress. places the responsibility on the Secretary of State to take prompt and appropriate action in behalf of any private vessel of the United States and its crew whenever such vessel is seized by a foreign country on the basis of rights or claims in territorial waters or the high seas which are recognized by the United States. Existing law provides that if a fine must be paid in order to secure the prompt release of the vessel and its crew. the Government shall reimburse the owners in the amount of the fine. I believe that when such illegal acts take place the very security and rights of our citizens to engage in trade and commerce on the seas is thereby threatened. and in the interest of keeping the sealanes open and secure to vessels and crews of the United States. that this act be amended to direct the Treasurer of our Government to pay the actual expenses and losses along with compensation to injured seamen. as certified to him by the Secretary of State. In addition to this amendment. I offer two bills for relief claims. which involved one of the most serious incidents of illegal seizures of our citizens on the high seas that has happened during the past 100 years.",

I feel now that they should be known. even though the \"whereas\" clauses have been stricken entirely from the resolution. As proposed to be amended the first whereas clause would have read: Whereas the welfare of the United States and other nations is related to the prevention of further hostilities in the region of the Middle East and the resumption of the passage of ships of all nations through the Suez Canal. The second whereas clause would have read: Whereas the present truce maintained by the United Nations in the Middle East may prove temporary if there is no lasting settlement of the Suez dispute and the ArabIsraeli conflict. and if economic instability in the region persists. and. The principal effect of these clauses was to interrelate the purpose of the resolution with the immediate difficulties in the region. without detracting one iota from the warning which the President desires to give the Soviet Union against aggression. But. as I have said. the two whereas clauses were defeated quite badly. by a vote of 18 to 7. and then all the whereas clauses were stricken from the resolution.

Suppose the President of the United States. and he has that power under this bill. decides to appoint as members of this Commission the distinguished gentleman from Rochester as the Republican member and the distinguished gentleman from Brooklyn as the Democratic member.

The amazing thing to me about the requirements of this Commission. to illustrate the point that i make. is that it is entirely within the realm of possibility that the gentleman from Rochester and the gentleman from Brooklyn might be two members of the Commission because the members of the Commission are exempted from the operation of section 281 of title 18 of the United States Code. I wonder how many have gone to the trouble to discover what section 281 is. I will tell you what it is. It is a felony statute. It is in the criminal code of the United States. It exempts Members of Congress from receiving gratuities for any service that they might render in connection with the performance of their duty as members of this Commission. So I say it is contemplated by the draftsmen of this statute that Members of Congress would be eligible. and I say to you in all frankness that I do not have any objection to it at all. But. it does seem as a matter of fair play. and I would say a bit of respectability. that there should have been some geographical limit placed upon the membership so that there would have been some semblance of bipartisanship or nonpartisan conduct. if you please.

Certainly I know that he must have been a very effective prosecutor and a very fair one. But I am interested that my colleague from Tennessee and the others here who are so anxious to improve this bill are not intending to vote for it when they have it improved. I think the amendment offered by the gentleman from Tennessee would. contrary to his assertion. hurt the bill. because the bill is addressed to a regional problem. and to limit the subpena power of the Commission. even to greater extent than is the case with Federal district courts. as the able chairman pointed out. would be to tie the hands of the Commission in attacking what is a regional problem. We may disagree. and I am sure we do. about what we should do with respect to the solution of this regional problem. but if we are trying to solve it by this method. trying to make the Commission effective. then we should not tie its hands and say its power should be limited with respect to subpenas to a single State. So I say it would certainly hurt the bill. It is all right to be against the bill. Many will vote against it. But I do not think we should say it would improve the bill to limit the Commissions power in this manner. The gentleman from Tennessee said this could give rise to a \"vicious and reprehensible\" practice of calling some man from Texas to Miami Beach. I do not think it is fair to assume that this would be done without reason. I do not think it is fair to assume that the President would appoint a person on the Commission who would do this. Therefore. I think it is fair to assume that the Commission would act in good faith. would use its subpena powers as necessary and justified. and that therefore the fears that there would be injustice of a sort that could be called vicious and reprehensible certainly are not warranted under these circumstances.",

The measure was subjected to searching scrutiny. It was examined from every viewpoint. And in the course of the debate many facts emerged which changed minds and altered opinions. Unfortunately. one aspect did not emerge until it was too late for action. It was the fact that the bill might. under some interpretations. carry a strong threat to the traditional freedom of the press. The parliamentary situation is such that nothing can be done as far as the present bill is concerned. Both Houses have acted. and the technical language is not in dispute. However. the situation can be handled easily by a concurrent resolution. I have asked that one be prepared. and have forwarded it to interested parties in the House and have presented it to interested Members ol the Senate. I intend to sponsor such a resolution in the Senate. when the differences in the civilrights bill are finally resolved. The intention of Congress. of course. was simply to protect the integrity of executive hearings from Commission employees who might act through malice. There was no intention to interfere with legitimate news gathering. It would be a travesty to cast a cloud upon a basic rightfreedom of the pressin a bill intended to promote rights. Therefore. I want my colleagues to know that there will be immediateand I believe successfulaction to remedy the situation. once the differences between the two Houses are resolved.

This subcommittee was a byproduct of the consideration by the Congress of Public Law 7. the socalled Middle East resolution.

In the first place. before voting on the Middle East resolution. it seemed essential to me that Congress obtain the full background of the crisis. There was opposition to this proposal in the joint committee. It was feared by some that it would be dangerous to take the time necessary to find out how we got into the mess before we voted on the resolution which was supposed to get us out of the mess. The administration put great pressure on the Congress to push the Middle East resolution through. In that atmosphere some thought that every minute counted and that the Middle East resolution had to be hurried along. It was also my thought that the review of Middle East policies to find out how the Suez crisis arose should go back only for the period necessary to understand the events in the crisis. I felt that a review of policies over the preceding 3 or 4 years would have been sufficient to bring to the surface all the relevant factors which led to that catastrophe. The cry immediately went up. however. that my proposal was a partisan one. It was suggested that I intended to investigate only what the Republicans had done in the Middle East and not what the Democrats may have done there earlier. It was ultimately decided by the joint committee to vote on the resolution and then to review Middle East policy. It was also decided to review Middle East policies all the way back to 1946. The joint committee decided to request that the Department of State provide a chronological statement. together with classified and unclassified supporting documents. telegrams. and the like. of all the events that have contributed significantly to the present situation in the Middle East. with particular reference to the period beginning January 1946.

The request of the two Senate committees for information about the origin of the Middle East crisis went to the State Department on January 29. At the end of February. when there had been no response from the Department of State. I asked the Department for a progress report.

I will put it this way: I think it is clear from the documents that. having entered into the agreements. and for reasons which are very involved. he thought the matter should be consummated. In other words. he did not approve of the withdrawal. Our Ambassador was also very strong against withdrawal of the offer.
